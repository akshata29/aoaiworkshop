MiFID II\nrequires the trading of shares and certain OTC derivatives to take\nplace on trading venues, and also significantly enhanced\nrequirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction\nreporting and investor protection, and introduced a position limits\nand reporting regime for commodities. The EC\u2019s proposal included\ntargeted changes to the MiFID II framework intended to reduce the\ncompliance burden on financial services firms as part of the EC\u2019s\nbroader initiative to assist in the EU\u2019s economic recovery from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The proposed changes include amendments\nto the commodity derivatives regime, investor protection rules and\nrules relating to research on small and medium-sized Enterprises.\nThe proposal is in the final stages of becoming EU law and is\nexpected to go into effect in 2022.The EC has also begun a review\nof the broader MiFID II framework and is expected to publish a\nfurther legislative proposal for changes to MiFID II in 2021. The\nU.K. is also re-evaluating the MiFID II framework and how the U.K.\nversion of MiFID II will apply going forward.\nThe EU capital and liquidity legislation for banks and investment\nfirms implemented many of the finalized Basel III capital and\nliquidity standards, including in relation to the leverage ratio, market\nrisk capital, and a net stable funding ratio. These requirements will\nbegin to take effect from June 2021. EU legislation also includes a\nrequirement for certain non-EU banks operating in the EU to\nestablish an intermediate parent undertaking (\u201cIPU\u201d) located in the\nEU. The IPU rule will allow a second IPU to be established if a\nsingle IPU would conflict with \u201chome country\u201d bank separation rules\nor impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to establish a legal\nentity structure that complies with the EU\u2019s IPU rule. The U.K.\nGovernment has delayed the effective date of the U.K. version of\nthe EU\u2019s legislation relating to changes in Basel III requirements\nuntil January 1, 2022. The Basel Committee recently finalized\ncertain changes to the Basel III framework, including revisions to\nthe credit risk and operational risk calculation methods. The Firm\u2019s\nbanking entities in the U.K. and EU will be required to comply with\nthese changes when they are implemented in those jurisdictions.\nThe Prudential Regulatory Authority (\u201cPRA\u201d) and European Central\nBank (\u201cECB\u201d) have published their supervisory expectations\napplicable to U.K. and EU banks, respectively, for management of\nfinancial risks arising from climate change. The supervisory\nexpectations for managing these risks address bank strategy, risk\nmanagement, scenario analysis and disclosure. U.K. banking\nentities, including J.P. Morgan Securities plc, will be expected to\nalign theirpractices with PRA expectations by the end of 2021. J.P.

chains, and\n\u2022closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and\nincreased unemployment.\nA prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the emergence of\nother diseases that give rise to similar effects, could deepen the\nadverse impact on the global economy.The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have\nhad a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses\nand results of operations, including:\n\u2022reduction in demand for certain products and services from\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and customers, resulting in lower\nrevenue, and\n\u2022increases in the allowance for credit losses.\nCertain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with the\ndetermination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened\nperformance risk in the economic environment precipitated by the\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus.\nThere can be no assurance that, even after adjustments have\nbeen made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not recognize\nunexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has\nresulted from these developments.\nA prolongation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic and the\nnegative economic impacts of the pandemic could have other\nsignificant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations and financial condition,

To the\nextent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, it\nmay also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks\ndescribed below.\nRegulatory\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are highly regulated, and\nexisting, new or changed laws, rules and regulations that\napply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its\nbusiness and operations.\nJPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations\nworldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and\nregulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions\naround the world in which it does business. Regulation of the\nfinancial services industry is extensive.\nThe regulation and supervision of financial services firms has\nexpanded significantly over an extended period of time. The\nincreased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has\naffected the way that it conducts its business and structures its\noperations. JPMorgan Chase could be required to make further\nchanges to its business and operations in response to expanded\nsupervision, new laws, rules and regulations, and changes to\nexisting laws, rules and regulations. These changes could result in\nJPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with\nlaws, rules and regulations and could reduce its profitability. In\nresponse to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and\nexpanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and\ncould in the future be, required to:\n\u2022limit the products and services that it offers\n\u2022reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-\nmaking activities\n\u2022refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might\notherwise pursue\n\u2022pay higher taxes, assessments, levies or other governmental\ncharges, including in connection with the resolution of tax\nexaminations\u2022dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are\ndisadvantageous\n\u2022impose restrictions on certain business activities, or\n\u2022increase the prices that it charges for products and services,\nwhich could reduce the demand for them.\nIn particular, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results of\noperations could be adversely impacted by changes in laws, rules\nand regulations, or changes in the application, interpretation or\nenforcement of laws, rules and regulations, that:\n\u2022proscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on certain\nfinancial services activities, or\n\u2022introduce changes to antitrust or anti-competition laws, rules\nand regulations that adversely affect the business activities of\nJPMorgan Chase.\nDifferences in financial services regulation can be\ndisadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business.\nThe content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting\nfinancial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such\nas the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or\noperates, and other criteria.

JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that\nthey could continue normal operations or subsequently be\ndivested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the\nParent Company\u2019s losses and any losses incurred by its\nsubsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent\nCompany\u2019s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured\ncreditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt\nsecurities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a\njunior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsubsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute)\nand secured creditors of the Parent Company.\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy,\nholders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent\nCompany would realize value only to the extent available to the\nParent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and\nsecured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid.\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry\nrecapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a\nsystemically important financial institution, such as the Parent\nCompany, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally\nadopted a single point of entry resolution strategy.\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a\nresolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or\nthe FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred\nresolution strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other\ndebt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever\nstrategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might\nhave been under JPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred strategy.\nRegulatory uncertainties associated with the U.K.\u2019s departure\nfrom the EU could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and operating model.\nThe U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU, which is commonly referred to\nas \u201cBrexit,\u201d was completed on December 31, 2020. The Trade and\nCooperation Agreement entered into between the U.K. and the EU\nin December 2020 included very limited provisions relating to the\nconduct of financial services activities between the U.K. and the\nEU. Accordingly, unless or until the U.K. and the EU enter into\nfurther agreements relating to financial services, the regulatory\nenvironment for financial services in the aftermath of Brexit can be\nexpected to:\u2022significantly limit the ability of U.K.-based financial services\nfirms to conduct business in the EU, and vice versa\n\u2022prolong uncertainty concerning the levels of market access for\ntrading venues, which could result in a reduction or\nfragmentation of market liquidity, and\n\u2022prolong ongoing uncertainties concerning optimal business\nmodels for firms providing financial services, especially given\nthat any changes in the regulation of such services by the U.K.\nmay not benefit from equivalence determinations by the EU.\nAs a result of these limitations and

reduce\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels,\nand thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can be negatively\naffected by adverse economic conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses are particularly affected\nby U.S. and global economic conditions, including:\n\u2022personal and household income distribution\n\u2022unemployment or underemployment\n\u2022prolonged periods of exceptionally low interest rates\n\u2022housing prices\n\u2022consumer and small business confidence levels\n\u2022changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer\ndebt, and\n\u2022the number of personal bankruptcies.\nHeightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that\nresult in reduced personal and household income could negatively\naffect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers\nare less able to service their debts. In addition, sustained low\ngrowth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or\nrecessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the\nproducts and services offered by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer\nbusinesses.\nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in\ndelinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and\nhigher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nearnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in\ncertain geographies and industry segments where economic\nrestrictions and shutdowns have occurred related to the COVID-19\npandemic, declining industrial or manufacturing activity that has\nresulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or\nwhere high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student\nloans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other\nconsumer loan obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its consumer businesses could\nalso be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions\nthat affect consumers, including:\n\u2022policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance,\neducation, immigration, employment status and housing, and\n\u2022policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher\ntaxes and increased regulation which could result in\nreductions in consumer disposable income.\nIn addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan\nobligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could, if\nenacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncustomers to declare personal bankruptcy andthereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and other\nconsumer loans extended to those customers.\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have an\nadverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale businesses.\nIn JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale businesses, market and\neconomic factors can affect the volume of transactions that\nJPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises\nclients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives\nfrom those transactions. These factors can also influence the\nwillingness of other financial institutions and investors to\nparticipate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase\nmanages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings.\nFurthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market\nconditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncapital markets businesses, including its loan syndication,\nsecurities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be\nreduced to the extent that those businesses:\n\u2022earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes,\nincluding when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their\noutstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions,\nor\n\u2022dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold\nlarger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be\nsold at favorable prices.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of\nthe economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and\ngas prices or an increase in commodity prices, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose\noperations or financial condition are directly or indirectly\ndependent on the health or stability of those market segments, as\nwell as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan\nChase could incur losses on its loans and other credit\ncommitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any\nsector of the economy that is under stress.\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets\nor holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by\ndeclining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic\nconditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that\nJPMorgan Chase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn,\ncould affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue from fees that are based\non the amount of assets under management or custody.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4975, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9af2ab5c-44fb-40bc-9cf9-30134bdb810e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9af2ab5c-44fb-40bc-9cf9-30134bdb810e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e51e8ecb-9826-4cc6-b551-359b2cfd0c02", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c29e7203b4f01513cadd85e96e6e4755899b90749f060ef8627caf6db368e888", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ee9616e-5425-43f3-8dfa-0650ceaa0f9f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "be65f3de67534a3e2f07de1da46616c525325792069c09712b35f04113ca09c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "772be2b2-383e-4139-ba1b-4855a9fb6756", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4b2b91415a75772a4af99867c70eb2a870d7d163891ad2445cdcda715b466ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3d55a8708b402236a11a1749482f3c7ffa66c27fb2faedd09e87ae60be9a4622", "text": "JPMorgan\nChase could incur losses on its loans and other credit\ncommitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any\nsector of the economy that is under stress.\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets\nor holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by\ndeclining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic\nconditions.

For\nexample, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nwholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental\nincome from commercial real estate properties which are owned or\nbeing built by those clients. Severe and sustained adverse\neconomic conditions, including higher unemployment caused by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and governmental actions taken in\nresponse to the pandemic, could result in reductions in the rental\ncash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants\nwhich, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and\nimpair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their\ncommercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in\nJPMorgan Chase experiencing higher delinquencies, defaults and\nwrite-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and\nincurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent\nloans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nearnings from its wholesale businesses.\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely\naffect certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue and income\nstreams related to the Firm\u2019s traditional banking and funding\nactivities.\nIn general, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:\n\u2022net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce\nthe amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment\nsecurities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest\ncontemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n\u2022unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which\ncould negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s broader asset and\nliability management strategy\n\u2022JPMorgan Chase to reduce the amount of deposits that it\naccepts from customers and clients, which could result in\nlower revenues, and\n\u2022a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s mortgage\nservicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for\nJPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit spreads\nmay widen or narrow not only in response to events and\ncircumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a\nresult of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions.\nChanges in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit spreads will affect, positively\nor negatively, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings on certain liabilities,\nsuch as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value.\nWhen interest rates are increasing, JPMorgan Chase can\ngenerally be expected to earn higher net interest income.\nHowever, higher interest rates can also lead to:\u2022fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate\nloans\n\u2022losses on underwriting exposures\n\u2022the loss of deposits, including in the event that JPMorgan\nChase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior\n\u2022lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest\nrate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in\na misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term\nborrowings\n\u2022less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n\u2022higher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nrevenues and its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates\ncan also negatively affect the payment performance on loans\nwithin JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios\nthat are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable\nrate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those\nborrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing\nJPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs\nrelated to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results may be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations and significant changes in the value of\nfinancial instruments.\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments\nwhich JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be\nmaterially affected by market fluctuations.

JPMorgan Chase\ncan also be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses\nincurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or\ninvestment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.\nTransactions with government entities, including national, state,\nprovincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan\nChase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation\nrisks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that\nactions taken by government officials were beyond the legal\nauthority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by\na previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in\nthe past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase\nto suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the\nrelevant jurisdiction.In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a\ncounterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-\nupon payments, which could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts\nwith regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of\nunderlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could\ncause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction,\noperational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These\nconsequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\neffectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market\nactivities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nThe financial or operational failure of a significant market\nparticipant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or\nconcerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant,\ncan have a cascading effect within the financial markets.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be significantly disrupted by\nsuch an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants\nincurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or\ndefaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant\ninterrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant\nmarket participant.\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral\ndeclines in stressed market conditions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4526, "text_template":

counterparties could lead to\nconcerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or\ncounterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type\nof interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit,\nliquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur\nlosses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses\nand investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be\nrequired to recognize higher allowances for credit losses with\nrespect to certain clients or industries in order to align with\ndirectives or expectations of its banking regulators.\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular\nindustry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the\ncredit quality of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or counterparties\nnot only in that particular industry or geography but in related or\ndependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could\nalso heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in\nthose affected industries or related or dependent industries to\nmeet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase\nregularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk\nexposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or\ncontagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against\nthose risks may not be successful.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can also be harmed by\nan excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank\ncompetitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer\nloans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant\nreductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of\nloans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of\nconsumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to\nweak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this\ncould impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan\nChase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related\nlosses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could\nlead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses may earn lower\nrevenues in such an environment.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during\na market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit\nrisks associated with those positions and the level of RWA that\nJPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital position, funding costs\nand the profitability of its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses could be\nimpaired if its liquidity is constrained.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by\nfactors such as:\n\u2022market-wide illiquidity or disruption\u2022unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a\nresult of changes in laws, rules and regulations\n\u2022inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or\nprices\n\u2022default by a CCP or other significant market participant\n\u2022unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\n\u2022unexpected loss of consumer deposits, and\n\u2022lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or\nfinancial institutions in general.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity may be caused by\nevents over which it has little or no control. For example, during\nperiods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant\nmarket illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan\nChase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources\nof liquidity.\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative\nsources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding,\nsuch as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks,\nis reduced.

I\nstandards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings,\nJPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.\nA successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could\ncause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients and\ncustomers.\nJPMorgan Chase experiences numerous attempted cyber attacks\non its computer systems, software, networks and other technology\nassets on a daily basis from various actors, including groups\nacting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals, \u201chacktivists\u201d\n(i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a\npolitical agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks\ncan take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer\nviruses or malicious code, which is commonly referred to as\n\u201cmalware,\u201d into JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems. These attacks are\ntypically designed to:\n\u2022obtain unauthorized access to confidential information\nbelonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers,\ncounterparties or employees\n\u2022manipulate data\n\u2022destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services\nunavailable\n\u2022disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems\n\u2022steal money, or\n\u2022extort money through the use of so-called \u201cransomware.\u201d\nJPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed\ndenial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online\nbanking services.\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber\nattacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will\noccur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and\nharmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and\ncustomers.\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute\nsecurity against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible\nto anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all\nbreaches. This is because:\n\u2022the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and\nare increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be\nrecognized until launched\n\u2022cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase\u2019s own employees, cyber-criminals,\nhacktivists, groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile\ncountries, or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the\noperations of financial institutions more generally\n\u2022JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity\nof the systems of the large number ofclients, customers, counterparties and third-party service\nproviders with which it does business, and\n\u2022it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on\nan internal network without being detected, might obtain\naccess to other networks and systems.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase\nin the future as JPMorgan Chase continues to expand its mobile\nbanking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal\nuse of internet-based products and applications. Furthermore,\nincreased use of remote access and third party video conferencing\nsolutions during the COVID-19 pandemic, to facilitate work-from-\nhome arrangements for employees, could increase JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s exposure to cyber attacks. In addition, a third party could\nmisappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting\nsignals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s employees.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems or the systems of a vendor,\ngovernmental body or another market participant could cause\nserious negative consequences, including:\n\u2022significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\nthose of its clients, customers and counterparties, including\nlosing access to operational systems\n\u2022misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan\nChase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties,\nemployees or regulators\n\u2022disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems and\nthose of its clients, customers and counterparties\n\u2022the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover\nand restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or\ndestroyed, or the inability to prevent systems from processing\nfraudulent transactions\n\u2022violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other\nlaws\n\u2022financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients, customers,\ncounterparties or employees\n\u2022loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s cybersecurity and\nbusiness resiliency measures\n\u2022dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients, customers\nor counterparties\n\u2022significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties\nor other sanctions, and\n\u2022harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4671, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a568793b-2a43-444c-abcd-41cf9a2073f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a568793b-2a43-444c-abcd-41cf9a2073f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0daa98a2-e75b-4601-8b94-1ca389e1bbc6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0f7248ca9d870810c0638a473cd04c74960f8a043044584608126b6b7be981fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ec15a81-5ab7-4c93-9250-4a317b595f40", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "dbb0ac9ee1ec6c2596d85cc1fa6665a9dc5abab9a075d8c1bad34f8a2850a1c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e947811e-2205-43cb-b47f-4bab5b380f1b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0fbe9cc26ae05bc686435dab06568fa5144c494236f2dd5f7998df6a6c7dd9ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f9cc9b65d87d809af7497643149e3c22cf46eb65e88563a09657b7cc434d8248", "text": "The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that\nJPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may\nnot be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of\ntime before such an investigation can be completed.

These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber\nattack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as\nwell as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to\ncontain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and\ncertain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before\nthey are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors\ncould further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber\nattack.\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to\nidentify and address operational risks associated with the\nintroduction of or changes to products, services and delivery\nplatforms.\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service,\nintroduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of\nproducts or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic\ntrading and cloud computing), or makes changes to an existing\nproduct, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or\nidentify new operational risks that may arise from those changes,\nor may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks\nassociated with those changes. Any significant failure in this\nregard could diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate one or\nmore of its businesses or result in:\n\u2022potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers\n\u2022increased operating expenses\n\u2022higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and\nother sanctions\n\u2022damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\n\u2022impairment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity\n\u2022regulatory intervention, or\n\u2022weaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational costs and customer\nsatisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of an\nexternal operational system.\nExternal operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected,\nwhether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to\nJPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a\nsystems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a\nvendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is\ndirectly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber\nattack involving another party to which such a vendor or\ninfrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data aggregators\nand other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncustomers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of\ncustomers or those parties arebeyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s security and control systems, including\nthrough the use of the internet, cloud computing services and\npersonal smart phones and other mobile devices or services.\nIf an external party obtains access to customer account data on\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems, and that party experiences a\ncyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this\ncould result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase\nand its clients and customers, including:\n\u2022heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute\nfraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems\n\u2022losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential\nliability for losses that exceed thresholds established in\nconsumer protection laws, rules and regulations\n\u2022increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of\nthe external party\u2019s security breach, and\n\u2022harm to reputation arising from the perception that JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s systems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorgan Chase\u2019s interconnectivity with clients, customers\nand other external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase\nincreasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks\nwith respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches\naffecting JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients or customers, or systems\nbreakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or\nmisconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan\nChase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational\nsystems or to safeguard confidential information, including\nrestricting the access of customers to their accounts.

These strategies\nand techniques are based to some degree on management\u2019s\nsubjective judgment. For example, many models used by\nJPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical\ncorrelations among prices of various asset classes or other market\nindicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid\nmarket environments, or in the event of other unforeseen\ncircumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become\ncorrelated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may make\nunrelated movements at those times. Sudden market movements\nand unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements\ncould, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its\ncapital levels could be reduced and it could face greater\nregulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or judgments,\nincluding those used in its financial statements, prove to be\ninadequate or incorrect.\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and\nother analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure,\nmonitor and implement controls over its market, credit, capital,\nliquidity, operational and other risks. These models and\nestimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical\ntrends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary.\nThe models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not\nbe effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to\na variety of factors, such as:\n\u2022reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict\nfuture events, including assumptions underlying the models\nand estimations which predict correlation among certain\nmarket indicators or asset prices\n\u2022inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain\neconomic and financial outcomes\n\u2022historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not\nanticipate severely negative market conditions such as\nextreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity\n\u2022technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may\nnot perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the\npersonnel using the technology\n\u2022models and estimations may contain erroneous data,\nvaluations, formulas or algorithms, and\n\u2022review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and\nestimations.\nSome of the models and other analytical and judgment-based\nestimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managingrisks are subject to review by, and require the approval of,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s regulators. These reviews are required before\nJPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations in\nconnection with calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and\noperational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase\u2019s models\nor estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject\nto higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial\nresults or limit the ability to expand its businesses. JPMorgan\nChase also uses internal models in connection with its stress\ntesting. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital actions may require regulatory\napproval and could be constrained if its banking regulators object\nto a capital plan or require the resubmission of a capital plan due\nto the perceived inadequacy of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s models,\nestimations or other factors.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply\njudgments in preparing its financial statements, including in\ndetermining the allowance for credit losses, reserves related to\nlitigation and the credit card rewards liability.

For example, technological advances and the growth of\ne-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions\nto offer products and services that traditionally were banking\nproducts. These advances havealso allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide\nelectronic and internet-based financial solutions, including\nelectronic securities trading, payments processing and online\nautomated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore,\nboth financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face\nthe risk that payments processing and other services could be\nsignificantly disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies,\nthat require no intermediation. New technologies have required\nand could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or\nadapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to\nmatch products and services offered by its competitors, including\ntechnology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used\nby customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in\nunexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s costs for\ncomplying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the\noffering of products and services through those technologies and\nreduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing\nproducts and services through those new technologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing\nfor JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and services or may cause\nJPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to\ntraditional banking products such as deposits and bank accounts.\nThis competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of\nproducts and services offered, transaction execution, innovation,\nreputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers,\nwhether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a\ndecision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in\nclient and customer expectations or other factors, could affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract or retain clients and\ncustomers.

This latter risk can be\nmagnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information\nis disseminated through those channels.\nSocial and environmental activists are increasingly targeting\nfinancial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase with public\ncriticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in\ncertain sensitive industries, including businesses whose products\nare or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or whose\nactivities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the\nenvironment, workers\u2019 rights or communities. Activists have also\nengaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s headquarters\nand other properties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nrelationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially\nengender dissatisfaction amongclients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan\nChase addresses social and sustainability concerns in its business\nactivities. Alternatively, yielding to activism targeted at certain\nsensitive industries could damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nrelationships with clients and customers, and with governmental or\nregulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does\nbusiness, whose views are not aligned with those of social and\nenvironmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm to\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could:\n\u2022cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business\nwith JPMorgan Chase\n\u2022impair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract new clients and\ncustomers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients\nand customers\n\u2022diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to hire or retain employees\n\u2022prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain\nclients or customers.\n\u2022cause certain investors to divest from investments in securities\nof JPMorgan Chase, or\n\u2022attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies.\nActions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in\nthe industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.

This\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an\ninvestigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions.

In addition, the\nextent of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory\nmatters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed\nthe amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for\nthose matters.\n32", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4555, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75f6a32e-9ede-4a06-b3bb-663342e8687e": {"__data__": {"id_": "75f6a32e-9ede-4a06-b3bb-663342e8687e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b538218-19a7-467c-bf96-37c4c5bda16f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "87f7b71e721848a1b87dfc2222bee05bd48a2673fc006d6e1f54ff3d83e21c97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b059072a-dd81-4122-913a-6f9f706186e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f49e65dd6d5763ecc7247731a2b93ac61da90871b0a644ac90f7e26def1ecf26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ddbf2b29-3111-4f64-86dd-308b4f498e90", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f2010c954dd091b2e1db35991363a5c2d3aded7d18e1bc4a342d8d3226779162", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a8bf409c9cf4466d5a74bd145e459f72a413ca80a66bc0ae7989efe23b175190", "text": "Item 1B.

The Firm continues to actively\nmonitor the health and safety situations at local and regional\nlevels, and will continue to adapt as these situations evolve.\nSupporting clients and customers\nThe Firm has supported its clients and customers during the\nchallenging conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by\nproviding assistance, primarily in the form of payment deferrals on\nloans and extending credit, including through its participation in the\nSmall Business Association\u2019s (\u201cSBA\u201d) PPP.\nRefer to Credit Portfolio on page 112 for information on assistance\ngranted to customers and clients. Refer to Consumer Credit\nportfolio on page 116 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on page 122\nfor information on retained loans under payment deferral.\nThe Firm has gradually re-opened its branches since April 2020,\nwith nearly 90% of its branches returning to full service as of\nDecember 31, 2020. Additionally, the Firm continues to provide a\nwide range of banking services that are accessible to clients and\ncustomers through mobile and other digital channels.\nProtecting and supporting employees\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm implemented\nalternative work arrangements, with the vast majority of its global\nworkforce working from home since the onset of the pandemic and\ncontinuing into the first quarter of 2021. The Firm also provided\nadditional benefits to employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSupporting communities\nSince March, the Firm has committed $250 million to help address\nhumanitarian needs and long-term economic challenges posed by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on the communities in which the Firm\noperates. As of December 31, 2020, over 75% of this commitment\nhas been funded.Departure of the U.K. from the EU\nThe U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU, which is commonly referred to\nas \u201cBrexit,\u201d was completed on December 31, 2020. The U.K. and\nthe EU have entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement\nwhich delineates many significant aspects of the future\nrelationship between the U.K. and the EU. However, the\nagreement contained very limited provisions relating to cross-\nborder financial services, and the U.K. and the EU are expected to\nengage in further negotiations concerning financial services.\nThe Firm has executed and continues to execute on its Firmwide\nBrexit Implementation program, which encompasses a strategic\nimplementation plan across all impacted businesses and functions,\nincluding an ongoing assessment of political, legal and regulatory\nand other implementation risks. A key focus of the program has\nbeen to ensure continuity of service to the Firm\u2019s EU clients in the\nfollowing areas: regulatory and legal entities; clients; and business\nand operations.\nRegulatory and legal entities\nThe Firm\u2019s legal entities in Germany, Luxembourg and Ireland are\nnow licensed to provide and are providing services to the Firm\u2019s\nEU clients, including through a branch network covering locations\nsuch as Paris, Madrid and Milan. Subject to limited exceptions, the\nFirm\u2019s U.K.-based legal entities are no longer permitted to transact\nbusiness from the U.K. with EU clients.\nClients\nAgreements covering substantially all of the Firm\u2019s EU client\nactivity have been re-documented to EU legal entities to facilitate\ncontinuation of service. The Firm continues to actively engage with\nthose clients that have not completed re-documentation or\nrequired operational changes.\nBusiness and operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional risk to the Firm\u2019s\nBrexit Implementation program, particularly in relation to staff\nrelocations. As a result, the Firm has worked closely with\nregulators and employees to ensure that critical staff are relocated\nin a safe and timely manner so that the Firm can meet its\nregulatory commitments and continue serving its clients. Further\nrelocations are planned for 2021, and the Firm\u2019s longer-term EU\nstaffing strategy will be developed over time in cooperation with its\nregulators and as the post-Brexit market landscape evolves in\norder to ensure that the Firm maintains operational resilience and\neffective client coverage.\n50 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4811, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4b40be9-ec8d-4a1b-8f51-18c43ab2d046": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4b40be9-ec8d-4a1b-8f51-18c43ab2d046", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2fb644ee-5c5b-4cdc-8c0d-7f087c1e791a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "79895a50c02f9c5c9923d44fe8f4f5e87ff7e1673259df4e23d395ef07db191e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba8772fa-4601-47b7-8f9f-f16b082a1742", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "680bf1dea9d91261503ebd5b8a822e4cf037f2f5877e384d9692c399e9b9f57c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fc4c9f9d-0b98-4f11-b423-cf75534f3094", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "94ae587d8084c59ee36f6a5a38f8a0c152eb96fa5197df8e04570f83afb9ec1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a13fbf6bb7e1f88e76fc03b30b7af4fda5e3d36bad61fa2d71c8fb8f86466d03", "text": "Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cIBOR\u201d) transition\nJPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue to make\nprogress in preparing for the discontinuation of the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other IBORs to comply with\nthe International Organization of Securities Commission\u2019s\nstandards for transaction-based benchmark rates.\nOn November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the\nadministrator of LIBOR, announced a public consultation on its\nproposal to cease the publication of the principal tenors of U.S.\ndollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month\nand 12-month LIBOR) immediately following a final publication on\nJune 30, 2023.

The Firm believes that cash flows from\noperations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its\ncapacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured\nsources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs.\n\u2022In 2020, cash used primarily reflected higher trading assets,\nother assets, and securities borrowed, partially offset by higher\ntrading liabilities and net income excluding noncash\nadjustments.\n\u2022In 2019, cash provided primarily reflected net income excluding\nnoncash adjustments, lower trading assets, and net proceeds of\nsales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale,\npartially offset by higher securities borrowed, an increase in\nother assets and a decrease in trading liabilities.Investing activities\nThe Firm\u2019s investing activities predominantly include originating\nheld-for-investment loans and investing in the investment\nsecurities portfolio, and other short-term instruments.\n\u2022In 2020, cash used primarily reflected net purchases of\ninvestment securities, higher net originations of loans, and\nhigher securities purchased under resale agreements.\n\u2022In 2019, cash used reflected net purchases of investment\nsecurities, partially offset by lower securities purchased under\nresale agreements, and net proceeds from sales and\nsecuritizations of loans held-for-investment.\nFinancing activities\nThe Firm\u2019s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits\nand issuing long-term debt, as well as preferred stock.\n\u2022In 2020, cash provided reflected higher deposits and an\nincrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase\nagreements, partially offset by net payments of long-term\nborrowings.\n\u2022In 2019, cash provided reflected higher deposits, partially offset\nby a decrease in short-term borrowings and net payments of\nlong-term borrowings.\n\u2022For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common\nstock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock.

Morgan Wealth\nManagement business unit within CCB. Prior-period amounts have\nbeen revised to conform with the current presentation, including the\ntransfer of approximately 1,650 technology and support staff during\nthe second and third quarters of 2020. Ultra-high-net-worth and\ncertain high-net-worth client relationships remained in AWM.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale\nPayments business unit within CIB following a realignment of the\nFirm\u2019s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments\nbusiness comprises:\n\u2022Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB\n\u2022Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was\npreviously reported in Lending in CIB.\nIn connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets,\nliabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Services\nbusiness were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and\nexpenses of the Merchant Services business are reported across\nCCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. In the\nfourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with\nthe associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB\u2019s\nWholesale Payments business from CCB and CB. Payment\nprocessing-only clients are those that only use payment services\noffered by Merchant Services, and in general do not currently utilize\nother services offered by the Firm. Prior-period amounts have been\nrevisedto reflect this realignment and revised allocation methodology.\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology\nResults of the business segments are intended to present each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management\nreporting process that derives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an\nannual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future\nperiods.\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to\nthe Firm\u2019s clients, the participating business segments may agree to\nshare revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally\nrecognized in the segment responsible for the related product or\nservice, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the\ntransaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\nExpense Allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by corporate\nsupport units, or another business segment, the costs of those\nservices are allocated to the respective business segments. The\nexpense is generally allocated based on the actual cost and use of\nservices provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related\nto corporate support units, technology and operations not currently\nutilized by any LOB, are not\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 65", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4538, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e478107-ab2e-438c-b494-a02fa7ab3c05": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e478107-ab2e-438c-b494-a02fa7ab3c05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "09852f5e-4485-4ea2-ade9-7c3aa9f5f105", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4cc19bc76c63f99ea03577cc10b2186f561eafc76dff526d549d81a38ed56ad4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0dc1e60-b017-4fc0-b55a-b7dfda0185ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "595fd4bda663c7e6b8b1afed18eec84979110d7443a908df88283bceda5b6c40", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c28768bd-89ff-4406-973b-fc9452bb170d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8395d9549004f8d54c1ac31b0c3bb713f7afae00c35ee25feeb05076135db820", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "201353588414ef9fc9a633b0876d49f289d629ecc8ca118000877e084c523bac", "text": "Management\u2019 s discussion and analysis\nallocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate.\nExpense retained in Corporate generally includes parent company\ncosts that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone\nbusinesses; and other items not aligned with a particular business\nsegment.\nFunds transfer pricing\nFunds transfer pricing is the process by which the Firm allocates\ninterest income and expense to each business segment and\ntransfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk exposures to\nTreasury and CIO within Corporate.

The methodology to allocate thecost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to\nthe business segments is aligned with the Firm\u2019s process to allocate\ncapital.

Markets consists of Fixed Income\nMarkets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal\ntransactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net\ninterest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business\nperformance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across\nrevenue line items. For example, securities that generate net\ninterest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are\nrecorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7\nfor a description of the composition of these income statement line\nitems.\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments\nand commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-\nmaking activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts\nrecognized upon executing new transactions with market\nparticipants, as well as \u201cinventory-related revenue\u201d, which\nis revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and\nother instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of,\nor in response to, client demand, and changes in the fair value of\ninstruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure\narising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue\nrecognized upon executing new transactions with market\nparticipants is driven by many factors including the level of client\nactivity, the bid-offer spread (which is the differencebetween the price at which a market participant is willing and able\nto sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another\nmarket participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and\nvice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are\ninterrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-\nrelated revenue, which include general market conditions, such as\ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity\nand commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic\nconditions.

The Firm\u2019s overall objective is to\nmanage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that\nbalances serving the interests of its clients, customers and\ninvestors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among\nother things:\n\u2022Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and\nescalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;\n\u2022Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and\nmanagement within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and\n\u2022Firmwide structures for risk governance.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation\nframework with strong internal governance and independent\noversight by the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of\nrisk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm\u2019s\nperformance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.\nRisk governance and oversight framework\nThe Firm\u2019s risk management governance and oversight framework\ninvolves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts\nof risks. \nDrivers of Risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of\nrisks include the economic environment, regulatory and\ngovernment policy, competitor and market evolution, business\ndecisions, process and judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing,\ndysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.\nTypes of Risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves.\nRisks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:\n\u2022Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or\nreputation associated with poorly designed or failed business\nplans or inadequate response to changes in the operating\nenvironment.\n\u2022Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default\nor change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer;\nor loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on\ninvestments, includingconsumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment\nportfolio risk.\n\u2022Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in\nmarket factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates,\nequity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied\nvolatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the\nshort and long term.\n\u2022Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse outcome\nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or\nsystems; human factors; or external events impacting the\nFirm\u2019s processes or systems. It includes compliance, conduct,\nlegal, and estimations and model risk.\nImpacts of Risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and\nqualitative. There may be many consequences of risks\nmanifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in\nearnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or\nqualitative impacts such as reputation damage, loss of clients and\ncustomers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance and oversight framework is managed\non a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk\nManagement (\u201cIRM\u201d) function, which consists of the Risk\nManagement and Compliance organizations. The Chief Executive\nOfficer (\u201cCEO\u201d) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk\nCommittee of the Board (\u201cBoard Risk Committee\u201d), the Firm\u2019s\nChief Risk Officer (\u201cCRO\u201d) to lead the IRM organization and\nmanage the risk governance structure of the Firm. The framework\nis subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee in the form of\nthe Risk Governance and Oversight Policy. The Firm\u2019s CRO\noversees and delegates authorities to LOB CROs, Firmwide Risk\nExecutives (\u201cFREs\u201d), and the Firm\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer\n(\u201cCCO\u201d), who each establish Risk Management and Compliance\norganizations, set the Firm\u2019s risk governance policies and\nstandards, and define and oversee the implementation of the\nFirm\u2019s risk governance.

Senior management considers the\nimplications on the Firm\u2019s capital prior to making any significant\ndecisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to\nconsidering the Firm\u2019s earnings outlook, senior management\nevaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring\nthe Firm\u2019s capital strength.\nCapital management oversight\nThe Firm has a Capital Management Oversight function whose\nprimary objective is to provide independent oversight of capital risk\nacross the Firm.\nCapital Management Oversight\u2019s responsibilities include:\n\u2022Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;\n\u2022Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and\nindicators, including capital risk appetite;\n\u2022Developing a process to classify, monitor and report capital limit\nbreaches; and\n\u2022Performing an independent assessment of the Firm\u2019s capital\nmanagement activities, including changes made to the\nContingency Capital Plan described below.\nIn addition, the Basel Independent Review function (\u201cBIR\u201d), which\nis a part of the IRM function, conducts independent assessments\nof the Firm\u2019s regulatory capital framework. These assessments are\nintended to ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory\ncapital rules in support of senior management\u2019s responsibility for\nmanaging capital and for the Board Risk Committee\u2019s oversight of\nmanagement in executing that responsibility.\nCapital management\nTreasury & CIO is responsible for capital management.\nThe primary objectives of the Firm\u2019s capital management are to:\n\u2022Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and\ninvest in the Firm\u2019s businesses through the cycle and in\nstressed environments;\n\u2022Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment\nopportunities;\u2022Promote the Firm\u2019s ability to serve as a source of strength to its\nsubsidiaries;\n\u2022Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital\nratios as well as maintain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d status for the Firm\nand its insured depository institution (\u201cIDI\u201d) subsidiaries at all\ntimes under applicable regulatory capital requirements;\n\u2022Meet capital distribution objectives; and\n\u2022Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a\nresolution period in accordance with the Firm\u2019s preferred\nresolution strategy.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through establishing internal\nminimum capital requirements and a strong capital governance\nframework. The internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm\u2019s\nregulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment\nof capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress\nevents, when setting its minimum capital levels.\nCapital management is intended to be flexible in order to react to a\nrange of potential events.\nThe current capital governance framework requires regular\nmonitoring of the Firm\u2019s capital position and follows prescribed\nescalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity\nlevels.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm\u2019s capital\nmanagement include the Capital Governance Committee, the\nTreasurer Committee and the Firmwide ALCO. Oversight of capital\nmanagement is governed through the CIO, Treasury and\nCorporate (\u201cCTC\u201d) Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk\nCommittee periodically reviews the Firm\u2019s capital risk tolerance.\nRefer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 85-89 for additional\ndiscussion on the Board Risk Committee and the ALCO.\nCapital planning and stress testing\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\nThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs, including the Firm, to\nsubmit at least annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and\napproved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses\nCCAR and other stress testing processes to ensure that large\nBHCs have sufficient capital during periods of economic and\nfinancial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital\nassessment and planning processes in place that address each\nBHC\u2019s unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain\nstress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates\neach BHC\u2019s capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy\nassessment processes (\u201cICAAP\u201d), as well as its plans to make\ncapital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock\nrepurchases.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5068, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df1e5df5-6c46-44f3-8c2c-ba9c24b238fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "df1e5df5-6c46-44f3-8c2c-ba9c24b238fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9008f202-d16b-4e96-a5c3-73ed375104b5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "eea16c07442fdd78a86d9d2f6b9b17239279d57fa6a394a95b21b9d01b0d6a04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "658741cc-f38b-4273-957d-1f4299821036", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "bca95bc5b4258e7a1afb543d0d9d16d5de81a2d6f421fc7387aae61a89fc4550", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "49bab722-5e67-479c-8d7b-43fcd56951b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6268702f95122b4d124a4b121f58d228c3669ae3fd485bcdb73cfac8d9271e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e2e9dd5a5685f6a88b07af64ae67837be09f707ee70f2137316aea7d4fc1befd", "text": "Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 85-89 for additional\ndiscussion on the Board Risk Committee and the ALCO.\nCapital planning and stress testing\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\nThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs, including the Firm, to\nsubmit at least annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and\napproved by the Board of Directors.

Refer to Key Regulatory Developments on pages 93\u201394 for\nadditional information.\nOn June 29, 2020, the Firm announced that it had completed the\n2020 CCAR stress test process. On August 10, 2020, the Federal\nReserve affirmed the Firm's SCB requirement of 3.3% and the\nFirm's minimum Standardized CET1 capital ratio of 11.3% (up\nfrom 10.5%). The SCB requirement became effective on October\n1, 2020.\nIn June 2020, the Federal Reserve determined that changes in\nfinancial markets or the macroeconomic outlook due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic could have a material effect on a firm\u2019s risk\nprofile and financial condition and therefore required all large bank\nholding companies, including the Firm, to update and resubmit\ntheir capital plans by November 2, 2020. On December 18, 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve released its results from the 2020 CCAR\nRound 2 stress test, which showed that large banks had strong\nlevels of capital and announced that it would allow all large banks,\nincluding the Firm, to resume share repurchases commencing in\nthe first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions for at least\nthe first quarter of 2021 given considerable economic uncertainty\nremained. The Federal Reserve has stated that due to uncertainty\nabout future economic conditions and the ultimate path of the\ncurrent recovery, the SCB will not be reset at this time. The\nFederal Reserve will notify firms by March 31, 2021 whether a\nrevised SCB requirement based on the 2020 CCAR Round 2\nstress test will be recalculated ahead of the 2021 annual CCAR\nassessment.\nRefer to Capital actions on page 99 for information on actions\ntaken by the Firm\u2019s Board of Directors following the 2020 CCAR\nresults.\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process\nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of\nDirectors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm\u2019s processes for\nmanaging the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance\nwith supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital\nadequacy. The Firm\u2019s ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols\nwith capital planning.\nThe CCAR and other stress testing processes assess the potential\nimpact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the\nFirm\u2019s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the\nparameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and\napplied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are\narticulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key\ndrivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate\nshort-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational\nrisk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key\nvulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. However,\nwhen defining a broad range of scenarios, actual events can be\nworse. Accordingly, management considers additional stresses\noutside these scenarios, as necessary. These results are reviewed\nby management and the Board of Directors.Contingency capital plan\nThe Firm\u2019s contingency capital plan establishes the capital\nmanagement framework for the Firm and specifies the principles\nunderlying the Firm\u2019s approach towards capital management in\nnormal economic conditions and during stress. The contingency\ncapital plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital\nlevels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the\nongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets\nout the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken\nor considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period\nof stress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including\nwell-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding\ncompany.

Effective January 1, 2020, the\nFirm adopted the Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses guidance\nunder U.S. GAAP. As permitted under the U.S. capital rules issued\nby the federal banking agencies in 2019, the Firm initially elected\nto phase-in the January 1, 2020 (\u201cday 1\u201d) CECL adoption impact to\nretained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year\nin each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response to the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking\nagencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on August 26,\n2020) that provided the option to delay the effects of CECL on\nregulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition\nperiod (\u201cCECL capital transition provisions\u201d).\nThe final rule provides a uniform approach for estimating the\neffects of CECL compared to the legacy incurred loss model\nduring the first two years of the transition period (the \u201cday 2\u201d\ntransition amount), whereby the Firm may exclude from CET1\ncapital 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses\n(excluding allowances on PCD loans). The cumulative day 2\ntransition amount as at December 31, 2021 that is not recognized\nin CET1 capital, as well as the $2.7 billion day 1 impact, will be\nphased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning January 1,\n2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition\nprovisions, and accordingly, for the year ended December 31,\n2020, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $5.7 billion, which is\nthe $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the\n$12.2 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses (excluding\nallowances on PCD loans).\nThe impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have also\nbeen incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and\ntotal leverage exposure.

The capital conservation buffer incorporates a global\nsystemically important bank (\u201cGSIB\u201d) surcharge, a discretionary\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital conservation\nbuffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital requirements and a\nvariable SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized\nregulatory capital requirements.Under the Federal Reserve\u2019s GSIB rule, the Firm is required to\nassess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two\nseparately prescribed methods based on data for the previous\nfiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the two. The first\n(\u201cMethod 1\u201d), reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the\nBasel Committee\u2019s assessment methodology, and is calculated\nacross five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity,\ninterconnectedness, complexity and substitutability.

The Firm provides\ncredit to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and\ninstitutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses.\nIn its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk\nprimarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business\nbanking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is\nexposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-\nmaking, and hedging activities with and for clients and\ncounterparties, as well as through its operating services activities\n(such as cash management and clearing activities), and securities\nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit risk through\nits investment securities portfolio and cash placed with banks.\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit\nrisk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and\nprocedures. The Firm\u2019s credit risk management governance\nincludes the following activities:\n\u2022Maintaining a credit risk policy framework\n\u2022Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all\nportfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval\n\u2022Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as\nappropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines\n\u2022Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the\napproval of credit exposure\n\u2022Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans and\n\u2022Estimating credit losses and ensuring appropriate credit risk-\nbased capital managementRisk identification and measurement\nThe Credit Risk Management function monitors, measures,\nmanages and limits credit risk across the Firm\u2019s businesses. To\nmeasure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for\nestimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default.\nMethodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several\nfactors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale),\nrisk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and\nborrower\u2019s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk\nmanagement and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center\nversus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk\nmeasurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or\ncounterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the\nexposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and estimates\ndescribed in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses\nfor its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects credit\nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment\nloan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments\nreflects credit losses related to the Firm\u2019s lending-related\ncommitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects\nthe credit losses related to the Firm\u2019s HTM and AFS\nsecurities. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting\nEstimates used by the Firm on pages 152-155 for further\ninformation.\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in\nthe allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential\nvolatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for\nloan losses and lending-related commitments. The analyses for\nthese losses include stress testing that considers alternative\neconomic scenarios as described in the Stress testing section\nbelow.\nStress testing\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk\nin the Firm\u2019s credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses\nthe potential impact of alternative economic and business\nscenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic\nscenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally,\narticulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across\nthe businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit\nmigration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in\nthe credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing\nprocesses, management also considers additional stresses\noutside these scenarios, including industry and country- specific\nstress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to\ninform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB\nlevel, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual\ncounterparties.\n110 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4769, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7ace8e1-4a33-4f99-9ce8-a1f66a632645": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7ace8e1-4a33-4f99-9ce8-a1f66a632645", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "98b239d3-4557-4a99-9b81-ece7afa7b18b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "51dd1710725edb1bd8739dfcae0a84f6420d032c46b59dbd1482c0e029be43dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "11cd8e53-ca85-4443-8660-488f2d388e6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2c9e2c290be4a2cbd918443f0c03b3aec0f3cd68b839ed33c50d0b0b36574678", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba3c15f7-4c08-412f-9bbc-2878201e5fb0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6a139a1532032a8e091e2d8fef4a26a3e94da119cba086fe316ee85adb29c09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "963f10636db9834da4f813ae408385a487da962041e1d9c8fbf8856654eed255", "text": "Risk monitoring and management\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed\nto preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and\ndecision-making process of extending credit to ensure credit risks\nare assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly\nand managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels.\nThe policy framework establishes credit approval authorities,\nconcentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review\nparameters and guidelines for management of distressed\nexposures.

In\nconjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-\nrated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer,\nexcluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio\nsegment, to align with the methodology applied when determining\nthe allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform\nwith the current presentation.

The 30+\ndelinquency rate decreased to 0.98% at December 31, 2020, from\n1.35% at December 31, 2019, primarily due to payment assistance\nand government stimulus.

The contractual amounts\nof these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit\nrisk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the\nFirm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these\ncontracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does\nnot believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale\nlending-related commitments is representative of the Firm\u2019s\nexpected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to\nNote 28 for further information on wholesale lending-related\ncommitments.\nReceivables from Customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans\nto brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by\nassets maintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on\ndeposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities).\nBecause of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk\nthe Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit\nadditional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest\nand accounts receivable on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\nClearing services\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients entering into certain\nsecurities and derivative contracts. Through the provision of these\nservices the Firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its\nclients and may be required to share in losses incurred by CCPs.\nWhere possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients\nthrough the collection of adequate margin at inception and\nthroughout the life of the transactions and can also cease the\nprovision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their\nobligations under the clearing agreement. Refer to Note 28 for a\nfurther discussion of clearing services.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks\nincluding credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest\nrates, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm makes\nmarkets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses\nderivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk\npositions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market\nrisk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is\nexposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed tothe credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded\nderivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures and options, and cleared over-\nthe-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d) derivatives, the Firm can also be\nexposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the\nFirm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from\nderivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master\nnetting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of\nthe Firm\u2019s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to\ncollateral agreements \u2014 excluding foreign exchange spot trades,\nwhich are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their\nshort maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily \u2014\nwas approximately 88% and 90% at December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.

Derivative receivables represent the fair value of\nthe derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by\nthe Firm. In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash\ncollateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and may be\nused as security when the fair value of the client\u2019s exposure is in the\nFirm\u2019s favor.

Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7\ngovernment securities, other liquid government agency and\nguaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities)\ndelivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as\ncollateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency\nand collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet\nsettled as of the reporting date.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the\nFirm\u2019s use of collateral agreements.\nWhile useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value\nof the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future\nvariability of that credit exposure. To capture the potential future\nvariability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-\nclient basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit\nloss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (\u201cDRE\u201d), and Average\nexposure (\u201cAVG\u201d). These measures all incorporate netting and\ncollateral benefits, where applicable.\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative\nexposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty\ncalculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5%\nconfidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the\nprimary measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for\nderivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives\nexposure management.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative\nexposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to\nbe equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input\nfor aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and\nother credit risk.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm\u2019s\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, at future\ntime periods. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is\nused as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to\ncalculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below.The fair value of the Firm\u2019s derivative receivables incorporates\nCVA to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on\nthe Firm\u2019s AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty\u2019s credit\nspread in the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that\nactive risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic\ncredit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement process takes into consideration the potential impact\nof wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the risk that\nexposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact\nof a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure\nto increase at the same time as the counterparty\u2019s capacity to\nmeet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence the\nnature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the\nextent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust\nthe CVA associated with a particular counterparty\u2019s AVG. The Firm\nrisk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit\nderivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange,\nequity and commodity derivative contracts.\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm\u2019s current\nderivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the\nPeak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show\nthat exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are\nadded to the portfolio.\nExposure profile of derivatives measures\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in billions)\n(a) (a)\n130 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4570, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45043396-8cf6-4c8d-ba55-183b742272a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "45043396-8cf6-4c8d-ba55-183b742272a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9be9a637-7562-4d99-b3db-419f167a6c23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "884441fed5f843aa44c7d2eccd172c932bd009be36e0ba21fc7780289b1482c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d535aa54-0f5e-4176-bc71-0bfe5fa086a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ba64c88754d6b3109f8567820b099bda61561f2c3cdab5e2406a19412e05ff01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b0e3e15f-1c67-4b9d-a089-59e96e24f7b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef937baf8f55a5da92266ac736e294abeb5d48ecd35197070d5c9c4f20655744", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fb5b66be726d978b368611271344235b6cffcff47755cc98b9487110a107f070", "text": "Credit derivatives\nThe Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in\nits capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to\nmanage the Firm\u2019s own credit risk associated with various\nexposures.\nCredit portfolio management activities\nIncluded in the Firm\u2019s end-user activities are credit derivatives\nused to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending\nactivities (loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives\ncounterparty exposure in the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses\n(collectively, \u201ccredit portfolio management activities\u201d).

The adoption of this guidance established a single\nallowance framework for all financial assets measured at\namortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures.\nThis framework requires that management\u2019s estimate reflects\ncredit losses over the instrument\u2019s remaining expected life and\nconsiders expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information.\nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses comprises:\n\u2022the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained\nloan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented\nseparately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\n\u2022the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is\npresented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts\npayable and other liabilities, and\n\u2022the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized\nwithin Investment Securities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased compared with\nDecember 31, 2019, primarily reflecting the deterioration and\nuncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, in particular in the\nfirst half of 2020, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, consisting of:\n\u2022a net $7.4 billion addition in consumer, predominantly in the\ncredit card portfolio, and\n\u2022a net $4.7 billion addition in wholesale, across the LOBs,\nimpacting multiple industries.\nThe adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, resulted in a $4.3\nbillion addition to the allowance for credit losses.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance during 2020\nThe increase in the allowance for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments was primarily driven by an increase in the provision\nfor credit losses, reflecting the deterioration in and uncertainty\naround the future macroeconomic environment as a result of the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Firm\u2019s central case reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates of approximately 7% through the second\nquarter of 2021 and remaining above 5% until the second half of\n2022. This compared with relatively low levels of unemployment of\napproximately 4% throughout 2020 and 2021 in the Firm\u2019s January\n1, 2020 central case.\nFurther, while the Firm\u2019s January 1, 2020 central case U.S. GDP\nforecast reflected a 1.7% expansion in 2020, actual U.S. GDP\ncontracted approximately 2.5% in 2020. As of December 31, 2020,\nthe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflect a return to pre-\npandemic GDP levels in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nDue to elevated uncertainty in the near term outlook, driven by the\npotential for increased infection rates and related lock downs\nresulting from the pandemic, as well as theprospect that government and other consumer relief measures set\nto expire may not be extended, the Firm has placed significant\nweighting on its adverse scenarios. These scenarios incorporate\nmore punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case\nassumptions, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment\nrates remaining elevated throughout 2021 and 2022, ending the\nfourth quarter of 2022 at approximately 6%, and in U.S. GDP\nending 2022 approximately 0.9% higher than fourth quarter 2019\nactual pre-pandemic levels.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment\nrates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at January 1, 2020\n2Q20 4Q20 2Q21\nU.S. unemployment rate 3.7 % 3.8 % 4.0 %\nCumulative change in U.S.\nreal GDP from 12/31/2019 0.9 % 1.7 % 2.4 %\nAssumptions at December 31, 2020\n2Q21 4Q21 2Q22\nU.S. unemployment rate 6.8 % 5.7 % 5.1 %\nCumulative change in U.S.\nreal GDP from 12/31/2019 (1.9)% 0.6 % 2.0 %\n(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n(b)4Q20 actual U.S. unemployment rate (quarterly average) was 6.8%. 4Q20\nactual cumulative change in U.S.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3932, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "902ad3ae-de0d-4599-b6c8-a5a27e46db44": {"__data__": {"id_": "902ad3ae-de0d-4599-b6c8-a5a27e46db44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a62eb536-772b-4123-b18b-c26b0f9bef0f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ec0f635e431992479e64e27dfafb31e35832ff3b0870e0c6dbba91733ddeebd1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0e3e15f-1c67-4b9d-a089-59e96e24f7b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ef937baf8f55a5da92266ac736e294abeb5d48ecd35197070d5c9c4f20655744", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "62bb80a8-34a8-451e-9429-0a62b1654961", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee88a107b1c1d1b633f73c6c3de2063a700ee62e24c0a8efb669d1668977c2a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ee14a17ac6898446398f5a267edea4a03c64716b7e8ca68cce64c5bd265273c1", "text": "unemployment rate 3.7 % 3.8 % 4.0 %\nCumulative change in U.S.\nreal GDP from 12/31/2019 0.9 % 1.7 % 2.4 %\nAssumptions at December 31, 2020\n2Q21 4Q21 2Q22\nU.S. unemployment rate 6.8 % 5.7 % 5.1 %\nCumulative change in U.S.\nreal GDP from 12/31/2019 (1.9)% 0.6 % 2.0 %\n(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n(b)4Q20 actual U.S. unemployment rate (quarterly average) was 6.8%. 4Q20\nactual cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 4Q19 was (2.5%).\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates\nwill be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future\nperiods.

The investment securities portfolio is predominantly\nheld by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance\nsheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly privately-held non-traded financial\ninstruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate.\nInvestments are typically intended to be held over extended\nperiods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-\nterm realized gains with respect to these investments.\nInvestment securities risk\nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a\ndefault in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by\nTreasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality\nsecurities. At December 31, 2020, the Treasury and CIO\ninvestment securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses,\nwas $587.9 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities\ncomprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings\nwhere available and where not available, based primarily upon\ninternal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages\n83\u201384 and Note 10 for further information on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk\nManagement on pages 135\u2013142 for further information on the\nmarket risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk\nManagement on pages 102\u2013108 for further information on related\nliquidity risk.\nGovernance and oversight\nInvestment securities risks are governed by the Firm\u2019s Risk\nAppetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee\nwith regular updates to the Board Risk Committee.\nThe Firm\u2019s independent control functions are responsible for\nreviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment\nsecurities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for\ninvestment securities are established for each risk category,\nincluding capital and credit risks.Principal investment risk\nPrincipal investments are typically privately held non-traded\nfinancial instruments representing ownership or other forms of\njunior capital and span multiple asset classes. These investments\nare made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a\nbroader business strategy. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments made to\nenhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business strategies. The Firm\u2019s\ninvestments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies,\nincluding the Firm\u2019s commitment to support underserved\ncommunities and minority-owned businesses. The Firm\u2019s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are\nreflected within their respective financial results. The aggregate\ncarrying values of the principal investment portfolios have not\nbeen significantly affected by recent market events as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. However, the duration and severity of\nadverse macroeconomic conditions could subject certain principal\ninvestments to impairments, write-downs, or other negative\nimpacts.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate carrying values\nof the principal investment portfolios were $27.5 billion and $24.2\nbillion, respectively, which included tax-oriented investments (e.g.,\nalternative energy and affordable housing investments) of $21.3\nbillion and $18.2 billion, respectively, and private equity, various\ndebt and equity instruments, and real assets of $6.2 billion and\n$6.0 billion, respectively.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm\u2019s approach to managing principal risk is consistent with\nthe Firm\u2019s risk governance structure. A Firmwide risk policy\nframework exists for all principal investing activities and includes\napproval by executives who are independent from the investing\nbusinesses, as appropriate.\nThe Firm\u2019s independent control functions are responsible for\nreviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investments\nin accordance with relevant policies. As part of the risk governance\nstructure, approved levels for investments are established and\nmonitored for each relevant business or segment in order to\nmanage the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts\nstress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that\nestimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other\nrisk events.\n134 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4637, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f42ba7d-cbba-4d7b-bfa8-696c04c5f422": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f42ba7d-cbba-4d7b-bfa8-696c04c5f422", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "345049e3-7fcb-43f6-b1d9-25b72fe3a869", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ed04a873dec24c4d0e301c62c0fc7547ceec814d1617d0278993c203ac4a30e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "65b57c9d-569b-492f-a33d-177255ce05a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d9fbac04876097eb632cc5c0fe1ca1357389eb2309fcf1af63d43f8954fd0224", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "16fcc7b8-7bd8-4f04-8b2a-27954cf54dd6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cb00a271b48461d53cbec9c16dc83aba5027b875ebd4f5db73e8b0d4ae85a2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ecfc1d364376577a7d53ae6f1115210645bb15cb5517022a3be8cde8ce1474e6", "text": "MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in\nmarket factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity\nand commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the\nvalue of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket Risk Management monitors market risks throughout the\nFirm and defines market risk policies and procedures.\nMarket Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate efficient\nrisk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance\nand provide transparency into the Firm\u2019s market risk profile for\nsenior management, the Board of Directors and regulators.

The Firm has a single VaR framework\nused as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using historical\nsimulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The\nframework\u2019s approach assumes that historical changes in market\nvalues are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes\nin the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk\nManagement VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely\naligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and\nCorporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides\nthe appropriate information needed to respond to risk events.\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-\nday holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which\napproximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR\nprovides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and\nlevels of diversification across product types and is used for\naggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR\nresults are reported to senior management, the Board of Directors\nand regulators.\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming\ncurrent changes in market values are consistent with the historical\nchanges used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur\nVaR \u201cbacktesting exceptions,\u201d defined as losses greater than that\npredicted by VaR estimates, an average of five times every 100\ntrading days. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed\ncan differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting\nexceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially\ndifferent from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of\nhistorical data used in the VaR calculation.\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR\nmodels that simulate historical market returns for individual risk\nfactors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as\npart of the Firm\u2019s risk management framework, comprehensive\nVaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose\nactivities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular\nand incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily\nchanges in market values over the historical period; inputs are\nselected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities\nand historical time series used to generate daily market values\nmay be different across product types or risk management\nsystems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are\naggregated at the Firm level.As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of\nmarket risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition,\nbased on their reliance on available historical data, limited time\nhorizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in\ntheir ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses,\nparticularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or\nsevere shifts in market conditions.\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in\nVaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate\nhistorical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for\nthese and other products when daily time series are not available.\nIt is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these\nproducts, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The\nFirm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as\nstress testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its\nmarket risk positions.\nThe daily market data used in VaR models may be different than\nthe independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in\nits monthly valuation process.

The framework is used to calculate\nmultiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and\nmarket sell-offs, assuming significant changes in market factors\nsuch as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates\nand commodity prices, and combines them in multiple ways to\ncapture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios.\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail\nevents in specific asset classes and geographies, including how\nthe event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously.\nScenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress\nbasis risk between different products. The flexibility in the stress\nframework allows the Firm to construct new scenarios that can test\nthe outcomes against possible future stress events. Stress testing\nresults are reported on a regular basis to senior management of\nthe Firm, as appropriate.\nStress scenarios are governed by an overall stress framework and\nare subject to the standards outlined in the Firm\u2019s policies related\nto model risk management. Significant changes to the framework\nare reviewed as appropriate.\nThe Firm\u2019s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the\nFirm\u2019s CCAR and other stress test results, which are reported to\nthe Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are\nincorporated into the Firm\u2019s Risk Appetite framework, and are\nreported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses\nabove certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown\nis a decline in revenue from its year-to-date peak level.\nEarnings-at-risk\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm\u2019s reported net\nincome is important as interest rate risk represents one of the\nFirm\u2019s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only\nfrom trading activities but also from the Firm\u2019s traditional banking\nactivities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities,\ntaking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 for a summary\nbyLOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-\nrisk.\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm\u2019s structural interest\nrate risk policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by\nthe Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in\npartnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm\u2019s structural interest\nrate risk profile and reviews it with senior management, including\nthe CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of structural\ninterest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function\nreporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for\nproviding independent oversight and governance around\nassumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural\ninterest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk\ngenerally through its investment securities portfolio and interest\nrate derivatives.\nStructural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of factors,\nincluding:\n\u2022Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet instruments\n\u2022Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same\ntime\n\u2022Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term\nmarket interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope\nof the yield curve)\n\u2022The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets,\nliabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates\nchange\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and\nliabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units\ntransfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds\ntransfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest\nrate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets.\nThese elements include asset and liability balances and\ncontractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment\nschedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset\ndates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any\ninterest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.\nOne way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is\nthrough earnings-at-risk.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5058, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "908f6468-c64e-465d-8a85-699aaa1b8d63": {"__data__": {"id_": "908f6468-c64e-465d-8a85-699aaa1b8d63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18704a4e-1d89-4c10-845a-2956f75ac161", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "10dba25788f910c07859222403da4a779dba4585d7721fb363ce3d56d5e7038f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f15224e-bbd0-4cac-81c7-88db2c012448", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9ac36920d5daa79837aa3a5010566d519886f1bbeb80d055d0b1699b3caeda2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0aa2012b-b9ca-4e0b-93b9-5e2003ebb0d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5bd4a046c81a854d4d01230c69c5c0728f1c694f755be17a56eee5e1b9bf6652", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "68a1c31ccb5c3843e24783293983742085af1e3698b8123d6efe4b4f758413b7", "text": "Business units\ntransfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds\ntransfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest\nrate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets.\nThese elements include asset and liability balances and\ncontractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment\nschedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset\ndates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any\ninterest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.\nOne way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is\nthrough earnings-at-risk.

Operational risk is inherent in the\nFirm\u2019s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including\nfraudulent acts, business interruptions, cyber attacks,\ninappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable\nlaws and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in\naccordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management\nattempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of\nthe Firm\u2019s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses,\nand the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates.\nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe Firm\u2019s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk (\u201cCCOR\u201d)\nManagement Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern,\nidentify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the\nFirm\u2019s operational risk.\nOperational Risk Governance\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of\noperational risk. The Control Management Organization, which\nconsists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is\nresponsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework\nand the evaluation of the effectiveness of their control\nenvironments to determine where targeted remediation efforts may\nbe required.\nThe Firm\u2019s Global Chief Compliance Officer (\u201cCCO\u201d) and FRE for\nOperational Risk is responsible for defining the CCOR\nManagement Framework and establishing minimum standards for\nits execution. Operational Risk Officers (\u201cOROs\u201d) report to both the\nLOB CROs and to the FRE for Operational Risk, and are\nindependent of the respective businesses or functions they\noversee.\nThe Firm\u2019s CCOR Management policy establishes the CCOR\nManagement Framework for the Firm. The CCOR Management\nFramework is articulated in the Risk Governance and Oversight\nPolicy which is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk\nCommittee periodically.\nOperational Risk identification\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-assessment\nprocess that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of\nthis process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness\nof their control environment to assess where controls have failed,\nand to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The\nFirm\u2019s Operational Risk and Compliance organization\n(\u201cOperational Risk and Compliance\u201d) provides oversight of these\nactivities and may also perform independent assessments of\nsignificant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or\nemerging risk.Operational Risk Measurement\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs independent risk\nassessments of the Firm\u2019s operational risks, which includes\nassessing the effectiveness of the control environment and\nreporting the results to senior management.\nIn addition, operational risk measurement includes operational\nrisk-based capital and operational risk loss projections under both\nbaseline and stressed conditions.\nThe primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is\nthe Loss Distribution Approach (\u201cLDA\u201d) statistical model, which\nsimulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss\nprojections based on historical data. The LDA model is used to\nestimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time\nhorizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates\nactual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the\nperiod in which those losses were realized, and the calculation\ngenerally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or\nbusiness activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated\nor reduced.\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm\u2019s\noperational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the\nAdvanced Measurement Approach (\u201cAMA\u201d), incorporates internal\nand external losses as well as management\u2019s view of tail risk\ncaptured through operational risk scenario analysis, and\nevaluation of key business environment and internal control\nmetrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its\nAMA estimate of operational risk capital.\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on\noperational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of\nmaterial operational risk events that may occur in a stressed\nenvironment.

The Firm will continue\nto review and assess the impact of the pandemic on operational\nrisk and implement adequate measures as needed.\nSubcategories and examples of operational risks\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational\nrisk subcategories such as Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal\nrisk, and Estimations and Model risk as well as other operational\nrisks, can lead to losses which are captured through the Firm\u2019s\noperational risk measurement processes. Refer to pages 148,\n149, 150 and 151, respectively for more information on\nCompliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk.\nDetails on other select examples of operational risks are provided\nbelow.\nCybersecurity risk\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm\u2019s exposure to harm or loss\nresulting from misuse or abuse of technology by malicious actors.\nCybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus\nfor the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and\nenhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks\nand other technology assets. The Firm\u2019s security efforts are\ndesigned to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity\nattacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to\nconfidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service,\nsabotage systems or cause other damage.\nOngoing business expansions may expose the Firm to potential\nnew threats as well as expanded regulatory scrutiny including the\nintroduction of new cybersecurity requirements. The Firm\ncontinues to make significant investments in enhancing its cyber\ndefense capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the\nappropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other\nbusinesses in order to understand the full spectrum of\ncybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance\ndefenses and improve resiliency against cybersecuritythreats. The Firm actively participates in discussions of\ncybersecurity risks with law enforcement, government officials,\npeer and industry groups, and has significantly increased efforts to\neducate employees and certain clients on the topic of\ncybersecurity risks.\nThird parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate\nthe Firm\u2019s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain,\nexchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial\nintermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm.\nThird party cybersecurity incidents such as system breakdowns or\nfailures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or\ncyberattacks could affect their ability to deliver a product or service\nto the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm\nor its clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the\nFirm, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the\nFirm\u2019s own security and control systems. As a result, the Firm\nengages in regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors\nand clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to\nimprove security. However, where cybersecurity incidents occur as\na result of client failures to maintain the security of their own\nsystems and processes, clients are responsible for losses\nincurred.\nTo protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm\u2019s\ninfrastructure, resources and information, the Firm maintains a\ncybersecurity program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to\ncyberattacks.

The program includes governance, awareness\ntraining, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and\ntactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business\ninterruption and public safety risks. The strength and proficiency of\nthe Firmwide resiliency program has played an integral role in\nmaintaining the Firm\u2019s business operations during and after\nvarious events.Payment fraud risk\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties\nunlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through\nmisdirected or otherwise improper payment. The risk of payment\nfraud remains at a heightened level across the industry,\nparticularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic due to the use\nof contingent forms of payment authentication methods, scams\ninvolving the pandemic being perpetrated including an increase in\nthe level of fraud attempts against consumers. The complexities of\nthese incidents and the strategies used by perpetrators continue to\nevolve. The Firm employs various controls for managing payment\nfraud risk as well as providing employee and client education and\nawareness trainings. The Firm\u2019s monitoring of customer behavior\nto detect new fraud strategies is periodically evaluated and\nenhanced in an effort to mitigate these fraud risks.\nThird-party outsourcing risk\nThe Firm\u2018s Third-Party Oversight (\u201cTPO\u201d) and Inter-affiliates\nOversight (\u201cIAO\u201d) framework assist the LOBs and Corporate in\nselecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing\ntheir supplier relationships including services provided by affiliates.\nThe objectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers to a\nhigh level of operational performance and to mitigate key risks\nincluding data loss and business disruption.

The\nestimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are\nused for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements,\nconducting stress testing, and making business decisions. A\ndedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance and\nReview (\u201cMRGR\u201d), defines and governs the Firm\u2019s policies relating\nto the management of model risk and risks associated with certain\nanalytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in\nrisk management, budget forecasting and capital planning and\nanalysis.\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations\nwithin MRGR\u2019s scope follows a consistent approach to the\napproach used for models, which is described in detail below.\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm\nbased on the specific purposes of such models. Users and\ndevelopers of models are responsible for developing,\nimplementing and testing their models, as well as referring models\nto the MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been\napproved, model users and developers are responsible for\nmaintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and\nevaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis.\nModel users and developers may seek to enhance models in\nresponse to changes in the portfolios and in product and market\ndevelopments, as well as to capture improvements in available\nmodeling techniques and systems capabilities.Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their\ncomplexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm\u2019s\nreliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of the\nMRGR. In its review of a model, the MRGR considers whether the\nmodel is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used.\nWhen reviewing a model, the MRGR analyzes and challenges the\nmodel methodology and the reasonableness of model\nassumptions, and may perform or require additional testing,\nincluding back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are\napproved by the appropriate level of management within the\nMRGR based on the relevant model tier.\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy,\nthe MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material\nchanges to existing models, prior to implementation in the\noperating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may\nbe granted to the Firm\u2019s policy to allow a model to be used prior to\nreview or approval. The MRGR may also require the user to take\nappropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in\nthe interim. These actions will depend on the model and may\ninclude, for example, limitation of trading activity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision\nor uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic\nenvironment. This is particularly true when the current and\nforecasted environment is significantly different from the historical\nmacroeconomic environments upon which the models were\ntrained, as the Firm has experienced during the COVID-19\npandemic. This uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of\njudgment and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs\nthan in typical periods.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages\n152-155 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and\nother valuation techniques.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 151", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3736, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "170363c0-16f7-49ba-bb1a-584dc5d69ad7": {"__data__": {"id_": "170363c0-16f7-49ba-bb1a-584dc5d69ad7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92a259e3-2662-442f-9d51-342ee0ffe2c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a488e16bb6a05b420056cdf4e2d9e661d8fe213804983adb359e48215209ca3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a0bc5fd-c11d-4133-b29b-f7e912220962", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0b06f012c549b1a872998d549aeef9c1178d0cd5dcf81c82eccf27583a0dea5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad27d948-fd91-45e1-837c-b2775920e4a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "712e26d0cf126663daffc0eb850b512360b0eb44bfeb55394e35ef4a9d4ab835", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "447bcbe11cb76c0109dc2fc4ee154e3e82e5ec4c0ededd4d7c21975b4da87c2c", "text": "Management\u2019 s discussion and analysis\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES USED BY THE FIRM\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies and use of estimates are\nintegral to understanding its reported results. The Firm\u2019s most\ncomplex accounting estimates require management\u2019s judgment to\nascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.\nThe Firm has established policies and control procedures intended\nto ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made\nas part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently\nreviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The\nmethods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors,\nthe nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and\nrisk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures\nare intended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm\nbelieves its estimates for determining the carrying value of its\nassets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s critical accounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents management\u2019s\nestimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life\nof the Firm\u2019s financial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\u2022The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained\nloan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\u2022The allowance for lending-related commitments, and\n\u2022The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development and weighting of\nmacroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss\nexperience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining\nexpected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information\non these judgments as well as the Firm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic\nforecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables\n(\u201cMEVs\u201d) that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with\nmodeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest\neffect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and\ngeography.\u2022Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, house price index (\u201cHPI\u201d) and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d).\n\u2022Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP,\nU.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit\nspreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of economic\nconditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit\nlosses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to\nthe next.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a weak labor market and\nweak overall economic conditions that will continue to affect\nborrowers across the Firm\u2019s consumer and wholesale lending\nportfolios. Significant judgment is required to estimate the severity\nand duration of the current economic downturn, as well as its\npotential impact on borrower defaults and loss severities. In\nparticular, macroeconomic conditions and forecasts regarding the\nduration and severity of the economic downturn caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly changing and remain\nhighly uncertain. It is difficult to predict exactly how borrower\nbehavior will be impacted by these changes in economic\nconditions. The effectiveness of government support, customer\nassistance and enhanced unemployment benefits should act as\nmitigants to credit losses, but the extent of the mitigation impact\nremains uncertain.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or\ninput might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors\nand inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may\nnot be consistent across all geographies or product types, and\nchanges in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent,\nsuch that improvement in one factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4872, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad27d948-fd91-45e1-837c-b2775920e4a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad27d948-fd91-45e1-837c-b2775920e4a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92a259e3-2662-442f-9d51-342ee0ffe2c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a488e16bb6a05b420056cdf4e2d9e661d8fe213804983adb359e48215209ca3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "170363c0-16f7-49ba-bb1a-584dc5d69ad7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "447bcbe11cb76c0109dc2fc4ee154e3e82e5ec4c0ededd4d7c21975b4da87c2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4bb54052-3af3-441b-8b82-f33747e94a66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8d2c6c808121169607581e10fa2d4f6c2f4ae0c896ae85bd0fc3f93cff4a58b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "712e26d0cf126663daffc0eb850b512360b0eb44bfeb55394e35ef4a9d4ab835", "text": "It is difficult to predict exactly how borrower\nbehavior will be impacted by these changes in economic\nconditions.

Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs requires management to\nassess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs\nincluding, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest\nrates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations,\nprices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nRefer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3\ninstruments, including unobservable inputs used.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management\njudgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of\nvaluation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the\nFirm\u2019s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that\nmeet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The\njudgments made are typically affected by the type of product and\nits specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the\nproduct or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened\nmarket volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by\nthe wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly\nfor positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other\nfactors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a\nparticular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its\nvaluation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of\nother market participants, the methods and assumptions used\nreflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the\ndetermination of fair value. The use of methodologies or\nassumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a\ndifferent estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note\n2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm\u2019s valuation process and\nhierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial\ninstruments.\nGoodwill impairment\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units\nand tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm\u2019s process\nand methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is\ndescribed in Note 15.\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill\nfor impairment. The goodwill associated with each business\ncombination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill\nimpairment testing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Firm reviewed current\neconomic conditions, including the potential impacts of the COVID-\n19 pandemic on business performance, estimated market cost of\nequity, as well as actual business results and projections of\nbusinessperformance for all its reporting units. The Firm has concluded that\nthe goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of\nDecember 31, 2020. The fair values of these reporting units\nexceeded their carrying values by at least 15% and did not\nindicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current\nprojections and valuations.\nThe projections for all of the Firm\u2019s reporting units are consistent\nwith management\u2019s current business outlook assumptions in the\nshort term, and the Firm\u2019s best estimates of long-term growth and\nreturn on equity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses\nthird-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and\nestimates.\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including\nthe goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2020.\nCredit card rewards liability\nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards\nprograms which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based\non their account activity and the terms and conditions of the\nrewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that\nan eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the\npoints can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash\n(predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and\ntravel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the\nestimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be\nredeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the\ncardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder\nredeems points.

These disputes over\ninterpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by\naudit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems\nof the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan\nChase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional\nincome taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the\nFirm records additional reserves as appropriate. In addition, the\nFirm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in\nincome tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is\npossible that revisions in the Firm\u2019s estimate of income taxes may\nmaterially affect the Firm\u2019s results of operations in any reporting\nperiod.\nThe Firm\u2019s provision for income taxes is composed of current and\ndeferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from differences between\nassets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus\nincome tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if,\nin management\u2019s judgment, their realizability is determined to be\nmore likely than not.

The communication of critical\naudit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are\nnot, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts\nor disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses \u2013 Portfolio-based component of\nWholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of\nthe wholesale and credit card loan portfolios was $23.4 billion on\ntotal portfolio-based retained loans of $653.4 billion at December\n31, 2020. The Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers\nexpected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The\nportfolio-based component of the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses\nfor the wholesale and credit card retained loan portfolios begins\nwith a quantitative calculation of expected credit losses over the\nexpected life of the loan by applying credit loss factors to the\nestimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are\ndetermined based on the weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration\nthe Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast\nmacroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This\nquantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments,\ntrends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing\nprocedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the\nportfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan\nportfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management in the forecast of macroeconomic\nvariables, specifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product, as the Firm\u2019s forecasts of economic conditions\nsignificantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses at the\nbalance sheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by\nmanagement in determining the quantitative calculation utilized in\ntheir credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments,\ntrends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate, which both in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing\nprocedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to\nthe creditloss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the\ncredit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved\nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the audit evidence.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and\nevaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses, including controls over model\nvalidation and generation of macroeconomic scenarios. These\nprocedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s\nprocess for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which\ninvolved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the models and\nmethodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real\ngross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and\naccuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management\u2019s adjustments to the quantitative\noutput for the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet\notherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a\nfinancial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in\n1968, is a leading global financial services firm in the U.S., with\noperations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking,\nfinancial services for consumers and small businesses,\ncommercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset\nmanagement. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s business segments.\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan\nChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally,\nwhere applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and\nreporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified\nto conform with the current presentation.\nConsolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of\nJPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest. All material intercompany balances\nand transactions have been eliminated.\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the\nFirm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest\nin an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest\nentity or a variable interest entity.\nVoting interest entities\nVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and\nprovide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make\nsignificant decisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations. For these\ntypes of entities, the Firm\u2019s determination of whether it has a\ncontrolling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting\nequity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling\nfinancial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities\u2019\nvoting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give\nthe Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.\nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has significant\ninfluence over operating and financing decisions (but does not\nown a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for\n(i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting (which\nrequires the Firm to recognize its proportionate share of the\nentity\u2019s net earnings), or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was\nelected. These investments are generally included in other assets,\nwith income or loss included in noninterest revenue.\nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured\nas limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of\nthese entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing\nmember, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the\nability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing\nmemberwithout cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority\nvote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to\nparticipate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not\nconsolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited\ncases where the non-managing partners or members do not have\nsubstantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the\nfunds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general\npartner or managing member and has a potentially significant\ninterest.\nThe Firm\u2019s investment companies and asset management funds\nhave investments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities,\nincluding investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture\nopportunities.

These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are\nmeasured and reported at fair value on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nbalance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-\nrelated commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing\nbasis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain\ncircumstances (for example, when there is evidence of\nimpairment).\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. Fair value\nis based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If\nprices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation\nmodels and other valuation techniques that consider relevant\ntransaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs,\nobservable or unobservable market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity,\nequity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that\nfinancial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described\nbelow.\nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or\nother factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a\nparticular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its\nvaluation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of\nother market participants, the methods and assumptions used\nreflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the\ndetermination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or\nassumptions by other market participants compared with those\nused by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation process\nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value\nestimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value. The Firm\u2019s VCG, which is part of the\nFirm\u2019s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking\nfunctions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and\ndetermining any fair value adjustments that may be required to\nensure that the Firm\u2019s positions are recorded at fair value. The\nVGF is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is\nresponsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from\nvaluation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF\nis chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of\nthe Firm\u2019s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB,\nCCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury\nand CIO.Price verification process\nThe VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking\nfunctions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation\ninputs and other market data, where available. Where independent\nprices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional\nreview to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The\nadditional review may include evaluating the limited market activity\nincluding client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those\nused for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of\nstructured instruments into individual components, comparing\nexpected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends,\nand reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also\nadditional levels of management review for more significant or\ncomplex positions.\nThe VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be\nrequired to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No\nadjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified\nwithin level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion\nbelow for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other\npositions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation\nadjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations,\nunobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet\nspecified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The\ndetermination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework\nacross the Firm:\n\u2022Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an\nobservable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of\nlower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity\nvaluation adjustments are made based on current market\nconditions.

Where\napplied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant\nmarket participant would consider in the transfer of the net\nopen risk position, including the size of the adverse market\nmove that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce\nthe net open risk position to a normal market-size.\n\u2022Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters\nmay be made when positions are valued using prices or input\nparameters to valuation models\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 171", "start_char_idx": 4098, "end_char_idx": 5952, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c03e86a8-3e89-491c-981b-98badc326231": {"__data__": {"id_": "c03e86a8-3e89-491c-981b-98badc326231", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4a688454-2b67-47e6-bc2e-ca19e5fa1682", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3a8cb48f06fdcfcbd90420a3db57c14906f8ae5a8741452074ed7714f64b3760", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "efe0a9cf-1d45-453d-88c9-7920542cc98d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "173", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "7fcbf6a0a7d2ddef58b20be4d064b249cb412d3a876c3065afc786411e9b6e28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "21f1d251-e1b0-48e3-9ccb-c9ec370af942", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3ad5367a9e2ac25618771485d7f3a145bb1c84192c8f723515b21024e7490e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a6daa74d955c71dc773bd129321ae580d4f0fce68f640c8cb2a47746972822bc", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\nthat are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or\nbecause they cannot be implied from observable market data.\nSuch prices or parameters must be estimated and are,\ntherefore, subject to management judgment.

Refer to Credit and\nfunding adjustments on page 188 of this Note for more\ninformation on such adjustments.\nValuation model review and approval\nIf prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar\ninstrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation\nmodels that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity\nand use as inputs market-based or independently sourced\nparameters. Where this is the case the price verification process\ndescribed above is applied to the inputs in those models.\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy,\nthe MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material\nchanges to existing models, prior to implementation in the\noperating environment.

The MRGR may also require the user to take\nappropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in\nthe interim. These actions will depend on the model and may\ninclude, for example, limitation of trading activity.\nValuation hierarchy\nA three-level valuation hierarchy has been established under U.S.\nGAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation\nhierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of\nan asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels\nare defined as follows.\n\u2022Level 1 \u2013 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices\n(unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u2022Level 2 \u2013 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted\nprices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and\ninputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly\nor indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial\ninstrument.\n\u2022Level 3 \u2013 one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are\nunobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nA financial instrument\u2019s categorization within the valuation\nhierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to\nthe fair value measurement.\n172 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2743, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21f1d251-e1b0-48e3-9ccb-c9ec370af942": {"__data__": {"id_": "21f1d251-e1b0-48e3-9ccb-c9ec370af942", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f66480f-13e0-4093-8a5c-d5332ee7e9c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "dd6d0afa0a425de6060ebc247d815787dccddd96dcc844b29bb3946835b365e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c03e86a8-3e89-491c-981b-98badc326231", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a6daa74d955c71dc773bd129321ae580d4f0fce68f640c8cb2a47746972822bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ebb4703-dc24-442d-9746-6ef7449a2ffd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef9b7a2bc5b2e204763d324a7233a3be02ba05b21252b031cd36aab10fc117ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b3ad5367a9e2ac25618771485d7f3a145bb1c84192c8f723515b21024e7490e0", "text": "The following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/instruments at fair\nvalue, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\nProduct/instrument  Valuation methodologyClassifications in the valuation\nhierarchy\nSecurities financing agreements Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 2\n\u2022 Derivative features: refer to the discussion of derivatives below for further\ninformation.\n\u2022 Market rates for the respective maturity\n\u2022 Collateral characteristics\nLoans and lending-related commitments \u2014 wholesale\nLoans carried at fair value\n(trading loans and non-trading\nloans) and associated\nlending-related commitmentsWhere observable market data is available, valuations are based on: Level 2 or 3\n\u2022 Observed market prices (circumstances are infrequent)\n\u2022 Relevant broker quotes\n\u2022 Observed market prices for similar instruments\nWhere observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are based\non discounted cash flows, which consider the following:\n\u2022 Credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS;

Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or\nwhen net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is\nadjusted for changes in fair value.

Refer to\npages 171-175 of this Note for further information on the Firm\u2019s\nvaluation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of\nfair value for individual financial instruments.\nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type\nand level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount\nof observable market information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed valuation models\nand other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable\ninputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when estimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1 and 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level\n3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation\nmodel or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack\nof observability of significant inputs, management must assess\nrelevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed,\ndefault rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity,\nequity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit curves.\nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial\ninstruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair\nvalue of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable\ninputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or\narithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to\nclassify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of\nthe unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,\nlevel 3 financial instruments typically include observable\ncomponents (that is, components that are actively quoted and can\nbe validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable\ncomponents. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in\nthe table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable\ncomponents of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the\nhighest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups\nof instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where\nprovided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in\nthe table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments\nthat the input is being used to value.In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic\naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an\nassessment of the reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various\ninstruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of\ninstruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two\noption contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure\nand valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different\nimplied volatility levels because the option contracts have different\nunderlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted\naverage values will therefore vary from period-to-period and\nparameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the\ninstruments held by the Firm at each balance

The impact of changes in inputs\nmay not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input\nmay give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where\nrelationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those\nrelationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist\nbetween observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as\nobservable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates\ndecline); such relationships have not been included in the\ndiscussion below. In addition, for each of the individual\nrelationships described below, the inverse relationship would also\ngenerally apply.\nThe following discussion also provides a description of attributes of\nthe underlying instruments and external market factors that affect\nthe range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions.\nYield \u2013 The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount\nfuture cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An\nincrease in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a\nfair value measurement.\nCredit spread \u2013 The credit spread is the amount of additional\nannualized return over the market interest rate that a market\nparticipant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of\nan instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of\nthe discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation.\nGenerally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a\ndecrease in a fair value measurement.\nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed\nsecurity primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The\nyield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by\nthe instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of\ninherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads\nreflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by\nthe Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven\nby the subordination of the security being valued and the\ncharacteristics of the underlying mortgages within the\ncollateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for\nresidential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any\ntenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities,\nobligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar\ninstruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor\nand the tenor of the obligation.\nPrepayment speed \u2013 The prepayment speed is a measure of the\nvoluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable\nobligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally\ndecline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment\nspeeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value\nmeasurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an\nincrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a\ndiscount to par.Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral\npool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying\nborrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the\nlevel and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by\nthe borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit\nquality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower\nborrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.\nConditional default rate \u2013 The conditional default rate is a measure\nof the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a\ncollateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is\ntypically no direct relationship between conditional default rates\nand prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the\nunderlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have\nlower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default\nrates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss\nseverity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the\nconditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a\nfair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the\nquality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure\nof the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned\nin the Firm\u2019s market-making portfolios, conditional default rates are\nmost typically at the lower end of the range presented.\nLoss severity \u2013 The loss severity (the inverse concept is the\nrecovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses\nresulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan,\nexpressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding\nloan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally\naccompanied by an increase in conditional default rates.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4920, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e642975f-6ba5-456a-9337-3be49132df73": {"__data__": {"id_": "e642975f-6ba5-456a-9337-3be49132df73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "183", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61df11ba-8cff-4270-9c10-e9565aca5fbc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "183", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9a6d38639cf919802a97ddee537001c97c87e14105d4c23b79a8f7f300ec7839", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7517efb5-cd78-4c12-9eeb-7f0bcfa85bab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "183", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6c68d58765e4aa53ed83744cf0f25bd19457d7e056161cd5e10f1b31a7f7fe2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "906d994f-d055-47c9-9522-8a084df54d3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62e87afc24aed8bec58df12680f0f0c9f8a22e621cb93b93809f5290f76349f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f8e87e9b148a26f482e80d085f174c36e4c9a2077279d28578dd360c687be365", "text": "An increase in conditional default\nrates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss\nseverity and an increase in credit spreads.

Correlation is a pricing input for a\nderivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more\nunderlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of\nderivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and\ncommodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When\nparameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter\nwill result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters\nare negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result\nin a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation\ncan result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value\nmeasurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in\ncorrelation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a\nfair value measurement.\nThe level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with\nmultiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including\nthe nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two\ncredit risk exposures would be different than that between two\ninterest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction\nmay also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between\nthe underlying risks may be different over different time periods.\nFurthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on\nmarket conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels\nwithin or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile\nmarket conditions.\nVolatility \u2013 Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible\nreturns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how\nmuch the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in\nvalue over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including\nequity options, commodity options, and interest rate options.\nGenerally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the\ninstrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in\nvolatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair\nvalue measurement.\nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-\nbased derivative depends on a number of factors, including the\nnature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a\nparticular equity security may be significantly different from that of\na particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as\nthe strike price of the option.Forward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer\nagrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the\npredetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of\nthe contract is zero at inception.\nThe forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain\nderivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest\nrates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected\nincome to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a\nresult of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in\nthe forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value\nmeasurement.\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements\nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated\nbalance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for\nfinancial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and\n2018. When a determination is made to classify a financial\ninstrument within level 3, the determination is based on the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value\nmeasurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively\nquoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the\ngains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value\ndue in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation\nmethodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable\ncomponents of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management\ninstruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the\nfollowing tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement activities related to such level 3 instruments.\n182 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4527, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}:

These market parameters\ngenerally do not consider factors such as counterparty\nnonperformance risk, the Firm\u2019s own credit quality, and funding\ncosts. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to\nthe base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.\nCVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark\ninterest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance\nrisk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate\nthe expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm\u2019s\nexisting positions with each counterparty, and then estimates\nlosses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery\nrate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering\ncontractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm\u2019s credit exposure,\nsuch as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this\nmethodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for\neach counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS\nspreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS\nspreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as\na derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads,\nwhich generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.\nFVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and\nis recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in\nthe principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the\ninstrument. The Firm\u2019s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized\n(including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d)\nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected\nfunding requirements arising from the Firm\u2019s positions witheach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the\nestimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for\nderivative liabilities, considers the Firm\u2019s credit risk (DVA). For\ncollateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting\nexpected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap\nrate given the underlying collateral agreement with the\ncounterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and funding\nadjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective\nperiods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities.\nThe FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm\u2019s own\ncredit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the\nimpact of changes in the Firm\u2019s own credit quality over time.\nYear ended December 31, \n(in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA $ (337)$ 241 $ 193 \nDerivatives FVA (64) 199 (74)\nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities\nThe valuation of the Firm\u2019s liabilities for which the fair value option\nhas been elected requires consideration of the Firm\u2019s own credit\nrisk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes\n(subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm\u2019s probability\nof default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the\nFirm\u2019s credit spread observed in the bond market.

These instruments include cash\nand due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold,\nsecurities purchased under resale agreements and securities\nborrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable,\nshort-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned\nand sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and\naccrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair\nvalue of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand,\nsavings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their\ncarrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these\ninstruments is not permitted.(a)\n(b) (d)\n(c)\n190 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3977, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05da5ef3-00b8-4274-9d81-954e972c64a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "05da5ef3-00b8-4274-9d81-954e972c64a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac74886d-e4ad-4e92-8462-af0b24576598", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d60c1aef3f24221b2edeeb0c03a9955dbe7dfbf9542865914140531a35e25da6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c41a2a24-49ec-442f-92dc-d27cd7c51ab4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "192", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "208b8d455c38675ae1b15b0442c4b8dfe2455d03ade4c3316eedfb14c0295064", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e074a46-baa5-4cf7-8bc6-35ca43d39348", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2808ff24f9f249cd526834b3ad1e13ae69cc12e7f67d9069e2ce5966744e97f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2d0c60a96b0c67214662bef336013da3e45f77110cbedc9073eb30b42f1f0ece", "text": "The following table presents by fair value hierarchy classification the carrying values and estimated fair values at December 31, 2020 and\n2019, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their\nclassification within the fair value hierarchy.\nDecember 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nEstimated fair value hierarchy Estimated fair value hierarchy\n(in billions)Carrying \nvalue Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Total\nestimated \nfair valueCarrying \nvalue Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Total\nestimated \nfair value\nFinancial assets\nCash and due from banks $ 24.9 $ 24.9 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 24.9 $ 21.7 $ 21.7 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 21.7 \nDeposits with banks 502.7 502.7 \u2014 \u2014 502.7 241.9 241.9 \u2014 \u2014 241.9 \nAccrued interest and accounts\nreceivable 89.4 \u2014 89.3 0.1 89.4 71.3 \u2014 71.2 0.1 71.3 \nFederal funds sold and securities\npurchased under resale\nagreements 58.3 \u2014 58.3 \u2014 58.3 234.6 \u2014 234.6 \u2014 234.6 \nSecurities borrowed 107.7 \u2014 107.7 \u2014 107.7 133.5 \u2014 133.5 \u2014 133.5 \nInvestment securities, held-to-\nmaturity 201.8 53.2 152.3 \u2014 205.5 47.5 0.1 48.8 \u2014 48.9 \nLoans, net of allowance for loan\nlosses 940.1 \u2014 210.9 755.6 966.5 939.5 \u2014 214.1 734.9 949.0 \nOther 81.8 \u2014 80.0 1.9 81.9 61.3 \u2014 60.6 0.8 61.4 \nFinancial liabilities\nDeposits $ 2,129.8 $ \u2014 $ 2,128.9 $ \u2014 $ 2,128.9 $ 1,533.8 $ \u2014 $ 1,534.1 $ \u2014 $ 1,534.1 \nFederal funds purchased and\nsecurities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements 59.5 \u2014 59.5 \u2014 59.5 183.1 \u2014 183.1 \u2014 183.1 \nShort-term borrowings 28.3 \u2014 28.3 \u2014 28.3 35.0 \u2014 35.0 \u2014 35.0 \nAccounts payable and other\nliabilities 186.6 \u2014 181.9 4.3 186.2 164.0 0.1 160.0 3.5 163.6 \nBeneficial interests issued by\nconsolidated VIEs 17.5 \u2014 17.6 \u2014 17.6 17.8 \u2014 17.9 \u2014 17.9 \nLong-term debt 204.8 \u2014 209.2 3.2 212.4 215.5 \u2014 218.3 3.5 221.8 \n(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate\nand contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads.\nFor certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.

consolidated financial statements\nNote 4 \u2013 Credit risk concentrations\nConcentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients,\ncounterparties or customers are engaged in similar business\nactivities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they\nhave similar economic features that would cause their ability to\nmeet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in\neconomic conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit\nportfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to\nobtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted\nunder the Firm\u2019s agreements. Senior management is significantly\ninvolved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels\nare adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk appetite.\nIn the Firm\u2019s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed\nprimarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key\nfocus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where\npotential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through\nchanges in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines.

Similarly, interest income and expense increase or\ndecrease as a result of variable-rate assets and liabilities resetting\nto current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and\nsubsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and\nliabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the\nderivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are\nexpected to substantially offset this variability.\nForeign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign\nexchange risk associated with certain foreign currency\u2013\ndenominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and\nforecasted transactions, as well as the Firm\u2019s net investments in\ncertain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional\ncurrencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in\nforeign currencies, the U.S. dollar\u2013equivalent values of the foreign\ncurrency\u2013denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted\nrevenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on\nthe derivative instruments related to these foreign currency\u2013\ndenominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are\nexpected to substantially offset this variability.Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of\ncertain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these\nderivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the\ndepreciation or appreciation of the related inventory.\nCredit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit\nderivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced\nin the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a\nfailure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily\nconsist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages\n209-211 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table\non page 209 of this Note, and the hedge accounting gains and\nlosses tables on pages 206-208 of this Note for more information\nabout risk management derivatives.\nDerivative counterparties and settlement types\nThe Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and\nsettled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also\nenters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options,\nand OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts\nare generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and\ncleared by the CCP, which is the Firm\u2019s counterparty from the\ninception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded\non a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.\nDerivative clearing services\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm\nacts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing\nhouses. The Firm does not reflect the clients\u2019 derivative contracts\nin its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for\nfurther information on the Firm\u2019s clearing services.\nAccounting for derivatives\nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own\naccount are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance\nsheets at fair value.\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets\nand liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and\npayables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement\nexists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4990, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbbdfa1a-5249-4f39-94aa-093ac28b8be4": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbbdfa1a-5249-4f39-94aa-093ac28b8be4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad379e7-69ee-4cb3-82bd-9c37ebcec9bc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "56becd05e328ad7000ff71a3a72f56dd7bf87bb9b37cfbe68adbaed4b2b1501c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9402da20-58f7-40ac-9be9-4e8e622fa908", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8b61f37866bafa1f0d8377a6c483314e642d8b1aa943234e158e3aebfbd929be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "20eb2299-c445-43e3-8ccd-3c497018a6d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "faa7c50c1c089c9ccb0560837820e8300b9a9bce8ba9cb6dab51157a6965b0e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b1308a03eb27bfdcf5d52582abb65b01292a359b6f478a74c78141b4d17c72a2", "text": "OTC-cleared derivatives are traded\non a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.\nDerivative clearing services\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm\nacts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing\nhouses.

However, JPMorgan Chase\ndoes not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives\ninvolved in the Firm\u2019s risk management activities. For example, the\nFirm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to\nmanage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments,\nbecause of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges.\nFor the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to\ncertain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives\nused for risk management purposes.\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly\neffective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being\nhedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge,\nthe risk management objective and strategy must be documented.\nHedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging\ninstrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type\nof risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is\nassessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess\neffectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as\nregression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value\ncomparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the\nchange in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and\nqualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any\nchanges in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has\nbeen, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at\noffsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged\nitem must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is\ndetermined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the\ndesignated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan\nChase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-\nterm debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For\nqualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the\nderivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being\nhedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded\nfrom the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and\nrecognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge\nrelationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item\ncontinues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item,\nand for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings\nas a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are\nrecognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item \u2013\nprimarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue.\nJPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the\nexposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate\nassets and liabilities and foreign currency\u2013denominated revenue\nand expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair\nvalue of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in\nearnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts\naffecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification\nof the hedged item \u2013 primarily noninterest revenue, net interest\nincome and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is\nterminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in\nAOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were\nhedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are\ndiscontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not\noccur according to the original hedge forecast, any related\nderivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in\nearnings.\nJPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value\nof the Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or\nbranches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For\nqualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the\nderivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are\nrecorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded\nfrom the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in\nearnings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 199", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4366, "text_template":

Gains and losses on these derivatives\nare primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to\nNote 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.Credit derivatives\nCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived\nfrom the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer\n(the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection\npurchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection\nseller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the\ncreditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is\nrequired to make payments under the contract when the reference\nentity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to\npay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection\nreceives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that\nthe underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject\nto a credit event.\nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit\nderivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary\npurposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively\nmanages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling\ncredit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to\nmeet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm\nuses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with\nlending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and\nderivatives counterparty exposures in the Firm\u2019s wholesale\nbusinesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain\nfinancial instruments in the Firm\u2019s market-making businesses.\nFollowing is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 209", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3901, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "416e18cc-9c42-4916-b67f-323ecaf6e4e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "416e18cc-9c42-4916-b67f-323ecaf6e4e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a08e774-c833-4554-b1ec-ddc3b8438874", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3f4642954bae4d055fa8c7e39b73c7518137532bc7f3629eb0bb920986651606", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e555aa2d-30b8-40f3-90a1-858cd97c7c07", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8352cef982c3ff2fa7d2e0e1abe2e2ab5842d404c440b167aeb248d3e9a50e00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "72af972e-e541-4ca3-b684-e751920e57b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afeae758654685dc80b4ac0e04fba0dba9ea034cf432f3ea6d133a4a8538b9a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4781b087dc1b9c6ede4e6e731ac7bbb9887f7cf08d77a747eca007e7464ecc45", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit default swaps\nCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single\nreference entity (\u201csingle-name\u201d) or a broad-based index. The Firm\npurchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-\nreference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts\nare either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name\nCDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference\nentity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit\nrisk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market\nsegments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS\nindex consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference\nentities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established\nwith a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect\nchanges in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in\nthe index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that\ndefaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced\nagainst specific portfolios of reference names or against\ncustomized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for\nexample, to provide protection against the first $1 million of\nrealized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such\nstructures are commonly known as tranche CDS.\nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts,\nupon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS\ncontract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the\nreference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the\nprotection seller for the difference between the face value of the\nCDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at\nsettlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the\nrecovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold\nthe debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to\nreceive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event\noccurs.Credit-related notes\nA credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer\nof the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit\nprotection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract,\nthe investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the\ninception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic\npayments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the\nreferenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value\nof the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the\nentities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified\ncredit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to\nrepay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the\ninvestor the difference between the par value of the note and the\nfair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of\nsettlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to\nthe defaulting reference entity.\nThe following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of\ncredit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and\npurchased as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Upon a credit\nevent, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out\nonly a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold,\nas the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes\ninto account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the\ntime of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts\nto sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar\nunderlying reference entities. Other purchased protection\nreferenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives\nbought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including\nindices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as\nprotection purchased through credit-related notes.\n210 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3887, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72af972e-e541-4ca3-b684-e751920e57b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "72af972e-e541-4ca3-b684-e751920e57b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "213", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fca95f2b-c0c8-4fa1-9663-5c11f71f707a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "213", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ef44fbf4c09e92a6a89229e6ce5f0b1fff94b9e61d33b640f628c86419d6f19a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "416e18cc-9c42-4916-b67f-323ecaf6e4e2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4781b087dc1b9c6ede4e6e731ac7bbb9887f7cf08d77a747eca007e7464ecc45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c40b6f20-c244-4258-9ada-94b4dc9d36fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd4bf870c343151fc1e87869e5ef9899bc25d0252de0dca5b62ea8b3afd47581", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "afeae758654685dc80b4ac0e04fba0dba9ea034cf432f3ea6d133a4a8538b9a6", "text": "The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the\nnotional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation,\nor related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm\u2019s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.\nTotal credit derivatives and credit-related notes\nMaximum payout/Notional amount\nProtection soldProtection purchased with\nidentical underlyingsNet protection\n(sold)/purchasedOther\nprotection\npurchased December 31, 2020 (in millions)\nCredit derivatives\nCredit default swaps $ (535,094) $ 554,565 $ 19,471 $ 4,001 \nOther credit derivatives (40,084) 57,344 17,260 9,415 \nTotal credit derivatives (575,178) 611,909 36,731 13,416 \nCredit-related notes \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 10,248 \nTotal $ (575,178) $ 611,909 $ 36,731 $ 23,664 \nMaximum payout/Notional amount\nProtection soldProtection purchased with\nidentical underlyingsNet protection\n(sold)/purchasedOther\nprotection\npurchased December 31, 2019 (in millions)\nCredit derivatives\nCredit default swaps $ (562,338) $ 571,892 $ 9,554 $ 3,936 \nOther credit derivatives (50,395) 46,541 (3,854) 7,364 \nTotal credit derivatives (612,733) 618,433 5,700 11,300 \nCredit-related notes \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 9,606 \nTotal $ (612,733) $ 618,433 $ 5,700 $ 20,906 \n(a)Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.\n(b)Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold;

The Firm also provides a qualified defined\ncontribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar\narrangements in certain non-U.S. locations.\nThe principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. is a qualified\nnoncontributory plan that provides benefits to substantially all U.S.\nemployees who were hired prior to December 2, 2017. The Firm\nhas frozen the U.S. defined benefit pension plan (the \u201cPlan\nFreeze\u201d). Effective as of January 1, 2020 (and January 1, 2019 for\nnew hires), new pay credits have been directed to the U.S. defined\ncontribution plan. Interest credits will continue to accrue on the\nU.S. defined benefit pension plan. As a result of the Plan Freeze,\na curtailment was triggered and a remeasurement of the U.S.\ndefined benefit pension obligation and plan assets occurred as of\nNovember 30, 2018. The plan design change did not have a\nmaterial impact on the U.S. defined benefit pension plan or the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Firm also has defined benefit pension plans that are offered in\ncertain non-U.S. locations based on factors such as eligible\ncompensation, age and/or years of service. It is the Firm\u2019s policy to\nfund the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the\nrequirements under applicable laws. The Firm does not anticipate\nat this time making any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit\npension plan in 2021. The 2021 contributions to the non-U.S.\ndefined benefit pension plans are expected to be $50 million, of\nwhich $35 million are contractually required.\nThe Firm also has a number of nonqualified noncontributory\ndefined benefit pension plans that are unfunded. These plans\nprovide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain\nemployees.The Firm offers postretirement medical and life insurance benefits\nto certain U.S. retirees and postretirement medical benefits to\ncertain qualifying U.S. and U.K. employees.\nThe Firm partially defrays the cost of its U.S. OPEB obligation\nthrough corporate-owned life insurance (\u201cCOLI\u201d) purchased on the\nlives of eligible employees and retirees. While the Firm owns the\nCOLI policies, certain COLI proceeds (death benefits, withdrawals\nand other distributions) may be used only to reimburse the Firm for\nits net postretirement benefit claim payments and related\nadministrative expense. The Firm has prefunded its U.S.\npostretirement benefit obligations. The U.K. OPEB plan is\nunfunded.   \nPension and OPEB accounting guidance generally requires that\nthe difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit\nobligation be measured and recorded on the balance sheet. Plans\nthat are overfunded (excess of plan assets over benefit obligation)\nare recorded in other assets and plans that are underfunded\n(excess benefit obligation over plan assets) are recorded in other\nliabilities. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit\nobligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI\nand recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over\nsubsequent periods as discussed in the Gains and losses section\nof this Note. Additionally, benefits earned during the year are\nreported in compensation expense; all other components of net\nperiodic defined benefit costs are reported in other expense in the\nConsolidated statements of income.\n216 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3564, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bf4b032-3474-46df-8541-895b20bcb5a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bf4b032-3474-46df-8541-895b20bcb5a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e949a83-355c-4c58-a3c9-78439fc2ef0a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "55415fc98016c20d462ab1cd8e79c3f4e46666e5518daf0a5d6ccea58a78db47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9155ff9-a9ed-4f0a-9a33-83a2d5287240", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c0db5a3c5bd871b5581d7f3d8071c5e170bf65930d02cae75c57ac769634f01e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "91c50560-b1ac-4469-a518-561799893da1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aaafbd88e04d3715dae98c6e3df2a2d04fcc21fa2fce97b7d123479a67fb0113", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bb6a41a8334ed10e1b55e30009b02ab51b8b359521c652d194dd0fee7d3593c8", "text": "The following table presents the pretax changes in benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in AOCI\non the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,Defined benefit \npension and OPEB plans\n(in millions) 2020 2019\nChange in projected and accumulated benefit obligations, U.S. defined benefit pension plans\nBenefit obligation, beginning of year $ (13,277)$ (12,173)\nBenefits earned during the year (2) (327)\nInterest cost on benefit obligations (422) (518)\nPlan amendments \u2014 (5)\nNet gain/(loss) (1,086) (944)\nBenefits paid 640 690 \nBenefit obligations, end of year, U.S. defined benefit pension plans $ (14,147)$ (13,277)\nBenefit obligations, other defined benefit pension and OPEB plans (4,990) (4,428)\nBenefit obligations, end of year $ (19,137)$ (17,705)\nChange in plan assets, U.S. defined benefit pension plans\nFair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 16,329 $ 14,521 \nActual return on plan assets 1,901 2,465 \nFirm contributions 29 33 \nBenefits paid (640) (690)\nFair value of plan assets, end of year, U.S. defined benefit pension plans $ 17,619 $ 16,329 \nFair value of plan assets, other defined benefit pension and OPEB plans 7,798 7,037 \nFair value of plan assets, end of year $ 25,417 $ 23,366 \nNet funded status, U.S. defined benefit pension plans $ 3,472 $ 3,052 \nNet funded status, other defined benefit pension and OPEB plans 2,808 2,609 \nNet funded status $ 6,280 $ 5,661 \nAmounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), U.S. defined benefit pension plans\nNet gain/(loss), U.S. defined benefit pension plans $ (1,558)$ (1,745)\nPrior service credit/(cost), U.S. defined benefit pension plans (4) (5)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), end of year, U.S. defined benefit pension plans $ (1,562)$ (1,750)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), other defined benefit pension and OPEB plans (24) (66)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) $ (1,586)$ (1,816)\nThe following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to value the benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit\npension plans.\nU.S. defined benefit \npension plans\nAs of December 31, 2020 2019\nDiscount rate  2.50%  3.30%\nRate of compensation increase  NA  NA\nInterest crediting rate  4.65  4.65\nGains and losses\nFor the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension plans, fair value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets.

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the net gain was primarily attributable to a\nmarket-driven increase in the fair value of plan assets, predominantly offset by a decrease in the discount rate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 217", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3244, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91c50560-b1ac-4469-a518-561799893da1": {"__data__": {"id_": "91c50560-b1ac-4469-a518-561799893da1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "220", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "419b08f8-87b7-4ea6-a38e-02e055685d0f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "220", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b6f56c30b7d290b3571dea12e738487ac9b715b6d671ac36a69e747c649664fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3bf4b032-3474-46df-8541-895b20bcb5a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "bb6a41a8334ed10e1b55e30009b02ab51b8b359521c652d194dd0fee7d3593c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "87e54627-edd1-48c4-a964-131a1e322941", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f4b4b7d0cdbe905706abadc6aedcc5f6a14433f9a0b0748b4d5260f6b225129", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "aaafbd88e04d3715dae98c6e3df2a2d04fcc21fa2fce97b7d123479a67fb0113", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm\u2019s\ndefined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and\nOPEB plans.\nPension and OPEB plans\nYear ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost, U.S. defined benefit pension plans\nBenefits earned during the year $ 2 $ 327 $ 323 \nInterest cost on benefit obligations 422 518 478 \nExpected return on plan assets (634) (776) (836)\nAmortization:\nNet (gain)/loss 6 147 80 \nPrior service (credit)/cost \u2014 \u2014 (21)\nCurtailment (gain)/loss \u2014 \u2014 21 \nNet periodic defined benefit plan cost/(credit), U.S. defined benefit pension plans $ (204) $ 216 $ 45 \nOther defined benefit pension and OPEB plans (81) (72) (72)\nTotal net periodic defined benefit plan cost/(credit) $ (285) $ 144 $ (27)\nTotal defined contribution plans 1,332  952 872 \nTotal pension and OPEB cost included in noninterest expense $ 1,047  $ 1,096 $ 845 \nChanges recognized in other comprehensive income, U.S. defined benefit pension plans\nPrior service (credit)/cost arising during the year \u2014 5 \u2014 \nNet (gain)/loss arising during the year (181) (745) 453 \nAmortization of net (loss)/gain (6) (147) (80)\nAmortization of prior service (cost)/credit \u2014 \u2014 21 \nCurtailment (loss)/gain \u2014 \u2014 (21)\nTotal recognized in other comprehensive income, U.S. defined benefit pension plans $ (187) $ (887) $ 373 \nOther defined benefit pension and OPEB plans (27) (270) 77 \nTotal recognized in other comprehensive income $ (214) $ (1,157) $ 450 \nTotal recognized in net periodic defined benefit plan cost/(credit) and other comprehensive\nincome $ (499) $ (1,013) $ 423 \nThe following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the U.S.\ndefined benefit pension plans.\nU.S. defined benefit pension plans\nYear ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nDiscount rate 3.30% 4.30% 3.70 / 4.50%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets 4.00 5.50 5.50\nRate of compensation increase NA 2.30 2.30\nInterest crediting rate 4.65 4.90 4.90\nPlan assumptions\nThe Firm\u2019s expected long-term rate of return for defined benefit\npension plan assets is a blended weighted average, by asset\nallocation of the projected long-term returns for the various asset\nclasses, taking into consideration local market conditions and the\nspecific allocation of plan assets.

PSUs are subject to the Firm\u2019s achievement of specified\nperformance criteria over a three-year period. The number of\nawards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant\namount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting\nperiod are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and\nthe related dividend equivalent share units are converted into\nshares of common stock after vesting.Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested,\nthe shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax\nwithholding, must be held for an additional two-year period, for a\ntotal combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to\neight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain\ncountries.\nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d) and stock\noptions have generally been granted with an exercise price equal\nto the fair value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s common stock on the grant\ndate. SARs and stock options generally expire ten years after the\ngrant date. There were no material grants of SARs or stock\noptions in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each\ntranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a\nseparate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each\ntranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the\nrespective tranche, provided that the employees will not become\nfull-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-\ncareer eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future\nsubstantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated\nvalue of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the\ngrant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-\nemployment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees\nwho will become full-career eligible during the vesting period,\ncompensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from\nthe grant date until the earlier of the employee\u2019s full-career\neligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche.\nThe Firm\u2019s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee\nshare-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of\ncommon stock or treasury shares. During 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nthe Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing\ntreasury shares.\nRefer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of\nshare-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per\nshare.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 221", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4264, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9eb92ce-7c20-4723-859f-39585e6b57f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9eb92ce-7c20-4723-859f-39585e6b57f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "224", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "262a5da7-2232-4518-bc86-bdf6e4a78bd2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "224", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "213dded9d965567cb9b43772baeaf68c3a0e288711b8b7508e0b8ce13f87b8a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a74e5122-e1e7-4a6d-b53b-02f2b9153292", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "223", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "56538a2080140ff4e17b5e1258ba7525da54ca54ac6e645e54370de8f8adc829", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "37384796-3734-4f28-b2af-6c1ea00676eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1785368c0bcd27b47985eebccf9b9ef5dfbd861e139b1b2f9987a9ce90b0059d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "daa31af291fcdc7f336ad0a78c7e23fe0651c64f6feecbcbed1c6363335a3fd9", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\nRSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity\nGenerally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock price at the\ngrant date, and for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

Any impairment not due to credit\nlosses is recorded in OCI.\nFactors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse\nconditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or\nfinancial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a\nsecurity; and payment structure of the security.\nWhen assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit\nlosses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market\nand economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural\nfeatures of the securitization, such as subordination, excess\nspread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement,\nand compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral\n(\u201cpool losses\u201d) against the level of credit enhancement in the\nsecuritization structure to determine whether these features are\nsufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.\nFor beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below \u201cAA\u201d\nat their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or\notherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover\nsubstantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates\nimpairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in\nexpected cash flows.\nAllowance for credit losses\nBased on its assessment, the Firm did not recognize an allowance\nfor credit losses on impaired AFS securities as of January 1, 2020\nor December 31, 2020.\n226 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2606, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac1ac744-3e5b-416c-b010-8c1200dd3df5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac1ac744-3e5b-416c-b010-8c1200dd3df5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2fa92bca-5bc2-4020-b555-d5ed32b5faf5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "85578d369ba5e24afc5b16b797fdb07bea404113a78ca789b03891900cbb75d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d01bdc95-f3bd-4701-8780-a1f8974019c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "228", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f9f0fb234b593cc153fa290a5ed588a2cbb1fc832e885131022a68dcc91bc888", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5c565fe-c211-45a9-8d6e-445078660c02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff3c6242246fbc0294903adbde4459c0095fb8109ceabdce405a58b3558c620c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "89ef1c3711586dfef4eb6263b202579d0b6586d476ade1c0ba1cc4bb1d9b4ac6", "text": "HTM securities \u2013 credit risk\nThe adoption of the CECL accounting guidance requires\nmanagement to estimate expected credit losses on HTM securities\nover the remaining expected life and recognize this estimate as an\nallowance for credit losses. As a result of the adoption of this\nguidance, the Firm recognized an allowance for credit losses on\nHTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities of $10 million as\na cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January\n1, 2020.\nCredit quality indicator\nThe primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk\nrating assigned to each security. At December 31, 2020, all HTM\nsecurities were rated investment grade and were current and\naccruing, with approximately 98% rated at least AA+.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states\nand municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is\ncalculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD\nand LGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived\nusing a weighted average of five internally developed eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line\ninterpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods\nbeyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further\ninformation on the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast.\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan\nobligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities\nis calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the\npresent value of the cash flows expected to be collected,\ndiscounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate. These cash flow\nestimates are developed based on expectations of underlying\ncollateral performance derived using the eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-line\ninterpolation, as well as considering the structural features of the\nsecurity.\nThe application of different inputs and assumptions into the\ncalculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to\nsignificant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or\nassumption over another, or considering other inputs or\nassumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit\nlosses on HTM securities.\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was $78 million\nas of December 31, 2020, reflecting $68 million recognized in the\nprovision for credit losses

To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the\nvalue of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality\nsecurities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.\nGSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or\nprovided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash\nproceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional\ncollateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate.\nMargin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty,\nthe type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral,\nand are monitored on an ongoing basis.\nIn resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed\nto credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received\nis less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral\namounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned\nagreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value\nof underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial\ncash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged.\nAdditionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting\nagreements and other similar arrangements with its\ncounterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the\nunderlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the\nevent of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm\u2019s policy to take\npossession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale\nand securities borrowed agreements.

The Firm accounts for loans based on the following\ncategories:\n\u2022Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e.,\n\u201cretained\u201d)\n\u2022Loans held-for-sale\n\u2022Loans at fair value\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting\nguidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\nThe following provides a detailed accounting discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s loans by category:\nLoans held-for-investment\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment are recorded at\nthe principal amount outstanding, net of the following: charge-offs;\ninterest applied to principal (for loans accounted for on the cost\nrecovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net\ndeferred loan fees or costs. Credit card loans also include billed\nfinance charges and fees.\nInterest income\nInterest income on performing loans held-for-investment is\naccrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate\nof interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net\ndeferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income\nover the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued\nbut unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and\naccounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For\ncredit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in\nthe loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the\nallowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in\nthe provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by\nreversing interest income. Expected losses related to accrued\ninterest on certain performing, modified loans to borrowers\nimpacted by COVID-19 are considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize\nan allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables,\nconsistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days\npast due by reversing interest income.\nNonaccrual loans\nNonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has\nbeen suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain\nconsumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed\non nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full\npayment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of\ndelinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in\ndefault for a period of 90days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the\nprocess of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when\nthe minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the\ncontractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g.,\nresidential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and\nunpaid for 30 days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are\ntypically maintained on nonaccrual status.\nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest\naccrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In\naddition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended.\nInterest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash\ninterest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the\nrecorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there\nis doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan\nbalance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the\ncarrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For\nconsumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the\nFirm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans\non a cash basis.\nA loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is\nreasonably assured and there has been demonstrated\nperformance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms\nof the restructured loan.\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are\ngenerally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status;\naccordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue\nto accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full.\nAllowance for loan losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected\ncredit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the\nbalance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a\ncontra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying\nvalue.

The determination of whether to recognize\na charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of\nthe Firm\u2019s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the\nworkout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower\u2019s\nequity or the loan collateral.\nWhen a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or\nthe estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the\ndetermination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the\ntype of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the\ncollateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based\non quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or\nother financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally\nestimated using a discounted cash flow model.\nFor residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon\nexternal valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower\nis either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker\u2019s\nprice opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of\nthe home based on an exterior-only valuation (\u201cexterior opinions\u201d),\nwhich is then updated at least every twelve months, or more\nfrequently depending on various market factors. As soon as\npracticable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a\ndebt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm\ngenerally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that\nincludes the interior of the home (\u201cinterior appraisals\u201d). Exterior\nopinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the\nFirm\u2019s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with\nthe estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior\nappraisals, considering state-specific factors.\nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally\nbased on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources.\nCollateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months,\neither by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal\nanalysis, in accordance with the Firm\u2019s policies. The Firm also\nconsiders both borrower- and market-specific factors, which mayresult in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at\nmore frequent intervals.\nLoans held-for-sale\nLoans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value,\nwith valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For\nconsumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis.\nFor wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual\nloan basis.\nInterest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized\nbased on the contractual rate of interest.\nLoan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or\npremiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related\nloan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums\nare an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are\nincluded in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair\nvalue adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of\nsale.\nBecause these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies\ndo not apply to these loans.

Credit-related\nlosses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-\ncredit related losses such as those due to changes in interest\nrates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in\nnoninterest revenue.\nIn the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-\nfor-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment\nportfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are\nsubsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm\u2019s\nallowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion\nof the methodologies used in establishing the Firm\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss\nmitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase\ngrants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm\u2019s economic loss\nand avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to\nultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the\nborrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by\nborrower-specific characteristics, and may include interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal\nforgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of\npayments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as\nTDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications\nthat are not considered concessions are not TDRs.\nLoans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases\nsuch loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to\nmodification. These loans may be returned to performing status\n(the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met:\n(i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a\nminimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has\nan expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably\nassured based on, for example, the borrower\u2019s debt capacity and\nlevel of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other\ncurrent market considerations. In certain limited and well-defined\ncircumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date,\nsuch loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of\nmodification.\nLoans modified in TDRs are generally measured for impairment\nusing the Firm\u2019s established asset-specific allowance\nmethodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the\nmodified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains\nsubject to the asset-specific component of the allowance\nthroughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is\nperforming and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note\n13 for furtherdiscussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm\u2019s asset-\nspecific allowance.\nThe Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers\nand clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including\npayment deferrals and covenant modifications.

The portfolio also includes\nhome equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans\nwith an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option\nloans that may result in negative amortization.\nThe following table provides information about retained consumer\nloans, excluding credit card, by class.\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2020 2019\nResidential real estate $ 225,302 $ 243,317 \nAuto and other 76,825 51,682 \nTotal retained loans $ 302,127 $ 294,999 \n(a)At December 31, 2020, included $19.2 billion of loans in Business Banking\nunder the PPP.Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for\nconsumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due\nprovide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing\nfinancial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay\nthe loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear\nwhether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In\nthe case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies\n(greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans\nthat will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation\ntransaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality\nindicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as\nfollows:\n\u2022For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV\nratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans,\nis an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of\ndefault. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide\ninsight into a borrower\u2019s continued willingness to pay, as the\ndelinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than\nthat for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral.\nThe geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides\ninsight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as\nthe regional economy, home price changes and specific events\nsuch as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The\nborrower\u2019s current or \u201crefreshed\u201d FICO score is a secondary\ncredit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an\nindication of the borrower\u2019s credit payment history. Thus, a loan\nto a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is\nconsidered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a\nhigher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high\nLTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than\na loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high\nFICO score.\n\u2022For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic\ndistribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the\nportfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic\ndistribution provides insights into the portfolio performance\nbased on regional economic activity and events.(a)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 237", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3100, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ade7eedc-243c-42de-b03a-bed647bb735a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ade7eedc-243c-42de-b03a-bed647bb735a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "240", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53d9e321-59fb-45ae-aa1f-02662659fffb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "240", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a075583b105c80431bb13cfd9982876e5e5382670d1e1be79805869069a7f5f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1175c1b9-9eba-4763-985d-4de54c21ade5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "239", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1bab5bd307ed30ba7185ad53558e9256f43c247db4b842162d0c05a6527e24e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb08d229-7a17-4b1d-a8c1-0b540f6852a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d83e7b3ab919c65ffe8c5b22343ec5013bacd072a7ebc048873b66fef33c2a38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "404dd1c325ca723a5c13194a4acfbd6afda9c174e62129b96dfe9c4df7e676e6", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\nResidential real estate\nThe following table provides information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.\n(in millions, except ratios)December 31, 2020December 31,\n2019\nTerm loans by origination year Revolving loans\nTotal Total 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Prior to 2016Within the\nrevolving\nperiodConverted to\nterm loans\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent $ 55,562  $ 31,820  $ 13,900  $ 20,410  $ 27,978  $ 50,232  $ 7,370  $ 15,792  $223,064  $239,979 \n30\u2013149 days past due 9 25 20 22 29 674 21 245 1,045  1,910 \n150 or more days past\ndue3 14 10 18 18 844 22 264 1,193  1,428 \nTotal retained loans $ 55,574  $ 31,859  $ 13,930  $ 20,450  $ 28,025  $ 51,750  $ 7,413  $ 16,301  $225,302  $243,317 \n% of 30+ days past due\nto total retained loans 0.02 % 0.12 % 0.22 % 0.20 % 0.17 % 2.86 % 0.58 % 3.12 % 0.98 % 1.35 %\n(a)Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $36 million and $17 million; 30\u2013149 days\npast due included $16 million and $20 million; and 150 or more days past due included $24 million and $26 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(b)At December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing\naccording to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.\n(c)At December 31, 2020 and 2019, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $40 million and $46 million, respectively,\nthat are 30 or more days past due.

Risk ratings are used to\nidentify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the\nportfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The\nPD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the\nestimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default\nof the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and\nstructural support for each credit facility.\nManagement considers several factors to determine an\nappropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor\u2019s debt\ncapacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor\u2019s earnings,\nthe amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of\ncontingencies, management strength, and the industry and\ngeography in which the obligor operates. The Firm\u2019s internal risk\nratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g.,\nborrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability\nto changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and\nMoody\u2019s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and\nLGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and\nassumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with\nqualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as\ninvestment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower\nLGD than non-investment grade ratings.Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized\nand criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into\nperforming and nonaccrual loans, representing management\u2019s\nassessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized\nloans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm\u2019s\ndefinition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory\ndefinition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention,\nsubstandard and doubtful categories.\nRisk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit\nRisk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated\ninformation affecting the obligor\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.\nAs noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in\nwhich the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall\ncredit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the\nmanagement and diversification of its industry and client\nexposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or\npotential credit concern.

The adoption of this guidance established a single\nallowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This\nframework requires that management\u2019s estimate reflects credit\nlosses over the instrument\u2019s remaining expected life and considers\nexpected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to\nNote 1 for further information.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s allowance for credit losses comprises:\n\u2022the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained\nloan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented\nseparately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\n\u2022the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is\npresented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts\npayable and other liabilities, and\n\u2022the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized\nwithin Investment Securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for\ncredit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses.\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses\nis complex and requires significant judgment by management\nabout the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least\nquarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO,\nthe CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of\ncredit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions,\nforecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses in future periods.\nThe Firm\u2019s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses\nand its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in\nthe following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the\npolicies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities.\nMethodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-\nrelated commitments\nThe allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related\ncommitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining\nexpected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments\nthat are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record\nan allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable\nlending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses\nrelated to accrued interest on credit card loans and certain\nperforming, modified loans to borrowers impacted by COVID-19\nare considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. However,\nthe Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest\nreceivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off no later\nthan 90 days past due by reversing interest income.\nThe expected life of each instrument is determined by considering\nits contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features,\nand certain extension and call options.The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated\nby considering expected future payments on the credit card\naccount, and determining how much of those amounts should be\nallocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the\nbalance sheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is\nmade using an approach that incorporates the payment application\nrequirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and\nDisclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest\nrate balances first.\nThe estimate of expected credit losses includes expected\nrecoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be\ncharged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance.\nCollective and Individual Assessments\nWhen calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance\nfor lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether\nexposures share similar risk characteristics.

The credit loss factors incorporate\nthe probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the\nevent of default. They are derived using a weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-\nquarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line\ninterpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods\nbeyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five\nmacroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse,\nextreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and\nare updated by the Firm\u2019s central forecasting team. The scenarios\ntake into consideration the Firm\u2019s overarching economic outlook,\ninternal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm,\nand market consensus and involve a governed process that\nincorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs,\nCorporate Finance and Risk Management.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs to degrees not\nexperienced in recent history, which has created additional\nchallenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and\nincreased the reliance on management judgment. In periods where\ncertain MEVs are outside the range of historical experience on\nwhich the Firm\u2019s models have been trained, the Firm makes\nadjustments to appropriately address these economic\ncircumstances. The Firm also considers the impact of other events,\nsuch as government unemployment benefits or other stimulus\nprograms, when determining whether adjustments are necessary.\nThe quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration\nmodel imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other\nsubjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These\nadjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical\nloss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major\nproduct or model. Management applies judgment in making this\nadjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated\nwith the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting\nstandards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration\nwithin an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant\ninternal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the\nportfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these\nfactors create further uncertainties.\nThroughout 2020, the Firm made adjustments to its quantitative\ncalculation which placed significant weighting on its adverse\nscenarios, as a result of continued uncertainty related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nThe application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation,\nand the assumptions used by management to adjust the\nquantitative calculation, are subject to significant management\njudgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another,\nor considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the\nestimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for\nlending-related commitments.Asset-specific component\nTo determine the asset-specific component of the allowance,\ncollateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which\nforeclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in\nthe wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated\nindividually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are\naggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the respective\nclass of assets.\nThe Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the\ndifference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present\nvalue of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the\nloan\u2019s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in\nimpairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the\nallowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair\nvalue of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine\nthe charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the\namortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the\namount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for\nrecoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the\nfair value of collateral).\nThe asset-specific component of the allowance for loan losses for\nloans that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs\nincorporates the effect of the modification on the loan\u2019s expected\ncash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well\nas other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For\nresidential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified\nin TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of default\nestimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected\nlosses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm\nconsiders the relationship between the credit quality characteristics\nof the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing\nprices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The\nFirm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date\nbased on actual redefaulted modified loans.

allowance for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments was primarily driven by an increase in the provision\nfor credit losses, reflecting the deterioration in and uncertainty\naround the future macroeconomic environment as a result of the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Firm\u2019s central case reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates of approximately 7% through the second\nquarter of 2021 and remaining above 5% until the second half of\n2022. This compared with relatively low levels of unemployment of\napproximately 4% throughout 2020 and 2021 in the Firm\u2019s January\n1, 2020 central case.\nFurther, while the Firm\u2019s January 1, 2020 central case U.S. GDP\nforecast reflected a 1.7% expansion in 2020, actual U.S. GDP\ncontracted approximately 2.5% in 2020. As of December 31, 2020,\nthe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflect a return to pre-\npandemic GDP levels in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nDue to elevated uncertainty in the near term outlook, driven by the\npotential for increased infection rates and related lock downs\nresulting from the pandemic, as well as the prospect that\ngovernment and other consumer relief measures set to expire may\nnot be extended, the Firm has placed significant weighting on its\nadverse scenarios. These scenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions,\nresulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates remaining\nelevated throughout 2021 and 2022, ending the fourth quarter of\n2022 at approximately 6%, and in U.S. GDP ending 2022\napproximately 0.9% higher than fourth quarter 2019 actual pre-\npandemic levels.The Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment\nrates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at January 1, 2020\n2Q20 4Q20 2Q21\nU.S. unemployment rate 3.7% 3.8% 4.0%\nCumulative change in U.S.\nreal GDP from 12/31/2019 0.9% 1.7% 2.4%\nAssumptions at December 31, 2020\n2Q21 4Q21 2Q22\nU.S. unemployment rate 6.8% 5.7% 5.1%\nCumulative change in U.S.\nreal GDP from 12/31/2019 (1.9)% 0.6% 2.0%\n(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n(b)4Q20 actual U.S. unemployment rate (quarterly average) was 6.8%. 4Q20\nactual cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 4Q19 was (2.5%).\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates\nwill be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future\nperiods.(b)\n(a)\n(a)\n252 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2514, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28c51590-25bb-4fed-988c-db8f27e9a055": {"__data__": {"id_": "28c51590-25bb-4fed-988c-db8f27e9a055", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "255", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "37620756-2aa3-4a12-b96c-e4475c0aa44f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "255", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ee6355c6f0ace8676800f9619770bd5b383574c26ca41747156425049a20aa6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e94c12e8-9869-41fb-8cd6-79bedfd57fd8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "254", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c9a49df626ad0522235d6a406ff5789f38cd3578fa4ec9575b6841711ad27916", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "13a884bb-4ab9-4245-928e-9d0909669e21", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "729f6ad0a580ed0fca6fd8d439a7d546ac2cb99e26931f5ffabcf60024fb39aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ac47ddc4869dfec16e6ac93da9cca440b24d9973c91711b23871a36a0f5fe535", "text": "Note 14 \u2013 V ariable interest entities\nRefer to Note 1 on page 167 for a further description of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs.\nThe following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a \u201csponsored\u201d\nVIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to\nsecuritize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase\u2013\nadministered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.\nLine of Business Transaction Type Activity2020 Form 10-K\npage references\nCCBCredit card securitization trustsSecuritization of originated credit card receivables253-254\nMortgage securitization trusts Servicing and securitization of both originated and\npurchased residential mortgages254-256\nCIBMortgage and other securitization trusts\nSecuritization of both originated and purchased residential\nand commercial mortgages, and other consumer loans254-256\nMulti-seller conduits Assist clients in accessing the financial markets in a cost-\nefficient manner and structures transactions to meet investor\nneeds256\nMunicipal bond vehicles Financing of municipal bond investments 256-257\nThe Firm\u2019s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows:\n\u2022Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM\nearns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund\u2019s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities\nthat qualify as VIEs, AWM\u2019s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the\nfinancial results of these entities.\n\u2022Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-\nsponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these\nentities. CB\u2019s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related\ncommitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third-party transaction.\n\u2022Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to\nspecialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition,\nTreasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed\nsecurities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not\nconsolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm\u2019s investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to page 258 of this Note\nfor more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities\nCredit card securitizations\nCCB\u2019s Card business may securitize originated credit card loans,\nprimarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d).

CCB generally retains servicing for\nall residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for\ncertain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of\nloans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for\ndecisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may\nalso retain an interest upon securitization.\nIn addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities\ninvolving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts.\nAs a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated\ninterests (including residual interests and amounts required to be\nheld pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires\npositions in the secondary market in the normal course of\nbusiness. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained\nor reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when\nconsidered together with the servicing arrangements entered into\nby CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of\ncertain securitization trusts.

The primary source of repayment\nof the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets.\nIn most instances, the assets are structured with deal-specific\ncredit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers\n(i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific credit\nenhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of\nhistorical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically\nin the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-\nspecific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm\u2019s potential losses\non its agreements with the conduits.\nTo ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to\nprovide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers\nin the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the\ncommercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the\nconduits has a minimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility\nassociated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit\nvehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and\nprogram-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of\ncredit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required\nis based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10%\nof the outstanding balance of commercial paper.\nThe Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits,\nas the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of\nthe conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the\nconduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring\ntransactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and\ncredit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs\nof the conduits. The Firm\u2019s interests that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative\nagent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement\nprovider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity\nand credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. Refer\nto page 257 of this Note for further information on consolidated\nVIE assets and liabilities.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes\nmarkets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits.

Other than the\namounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules,\nthe Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits.\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit\nenhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in\nconsolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of\nthe Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.

In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly\nrated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase\nby issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate\ncertificates (\u201cfloaters\u201d) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual\ninterests (\u201cresiduals\u201d). The floaters are typically purchased by\nmoney market funds or other short-term investors and may be\ntendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are\nretained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond\ninvestment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-\nparty investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and\nnon-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is\nretained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a\nthird party; refer to page 258 of this Note for further information.\nThe Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB\ntransactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB\ntrust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option\nprovider, and/or sponsor.\nJ.P.

The remarketing agent is responsible\nfor establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters,\nconducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters.\nThe remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets\nin floaters.

These include, for example, acting as a derivative\ncounterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement\nagent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions\nare conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions are\nbased on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration\nthe quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have\nthe power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest that\ncould potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not\nconsolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on\nits Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would\nrecord and report positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction.\nTax credit vehicles\nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles,\nwhich are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and\noperate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These\nentities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the\ngeneral partner or managing member and has control over the\nsignificant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the\nFirm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally\ninvests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a\nreturn primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the\nprojects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity\ninvestments and funding commitments, was $24.9 billion and\n$19.1 billion, of which $8.7 billion and $5.5 billion was unfunded at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In order to reduce the\nrisk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying\namounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax\ncredits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable\nhousing tax credits. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments.\nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)\nThe Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,\nincluding remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In\ncertain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider,\nhas entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual\nholder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,\nthe Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any\nshortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual\nholders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal\nbonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since\nthe Firm does not have the power to make decisions that\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of the municipal\nbond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider\nto customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $6.7\nbillion and $5.5 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held\nby such VIEs at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $10.5 billion\nand $8.6 billion, respectively. Refer to Note 28 for more\ninformation on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.Loan securitizations\nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including\nresidential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. The\npurposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy\ninvestor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.\nFor loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to\nconsolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan\nreceivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following\naccounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial\nassets are legally isolated from the Firm\u2019s creditors; (2) the\ntransferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the\ntransferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain\neffective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the\nFirm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their\nmaturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the\nholder to return the transferred assets).\nFor loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm\nrecognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the\nvalue of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or\nservicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets\nsold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in\nnoninterest revenue.\n258 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4576, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15cd177b-1c1f-4bc4-9e30-0b1272f9c5ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "15cd177b-1c1f-4bc4-9e30-0b1272f9c5ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "261", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b40e990-2399-416a-a9f5-5313cd0fe3f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "261", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1f66931840010de099600f0815235bdebb57ce4f980c34ff64f0295da1d2ea1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c4ab8e2-03b3-435e-9e55-158e9dec9485", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "260", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "25cd85ee889be4be652be11aa465dacf38efeb3739f17265943db086c630e6fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb119a7a-0c7f-411a-b8ca-7605d530be9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6482d01a7e8ddf5abcf73f15f8746040f2be13025d33d9001b6d93e81bcfd5f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "63284d9b567838a817b72fcc2fbb417348f9430faba55cbc2ad0f9c2773daaa0", "text": "Securitization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s securitization activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrelated to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was\nachieved at the time of the securitization.\n2020 2019 2018\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)Residential\nmortgageCommercial and\notherResidential\nmortgageCommercial and\notherResidential\nmortgageCommercial and\nother\nPrincipal securitized $ 7,103 $ 6,624 $ 9,957 $ 9,390 $ 6,431 $ 10,159 \nAll cash flows during the period:\nProceeds received from loan sales as financial instruments $ 7,321 $ 6,865 $ 10,238 $ 9,544 $ 6,449 $ 10,218 \nServicing fees collected 211 1 287 2 319 2 \nCash flows received on interests 801 239 507 237 411 301 \n(a)Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b)Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c)The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d)Represents prime mortgages.

The adoption of\nthe guidance requires recognition of an impairment loss when the\nestimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying\nvalue. It eliminated the requirement that an impairment loss be\nrecognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is\nbelow its carrying value.\nThe goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the\ncurrent fair value of each reporting unit with itscarrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value,\nthen the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill is considered not to be impaired.\nIf the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment\ncharge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s\ncarrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill\nallocated to that reporting unit.\nThe Firm uses the reporting units\u2019 allocated capital plus goodwill\nand other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of\nequity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing.\nReporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the\nallocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a\nvariety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers\nand applicable regulatory capital requirements.

The Firm\u2019s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because\nreimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is\ninsufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and\nagreements.\n(e)The decrease in projected cash flows was largely

These leases generally have terms of 20\nyears or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the\nlease, and include periods covered by options to extend or\nterminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will\nexercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than\ntwelve months are reported as a lease liability with a\ncorresponding right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset. None of these lease\nagreements impose restrictions on the Firm\u2019s ability to pay\ndividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter\ninto further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain\nescalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on\nmaintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease\ncomponents. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-\nlease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such,\nreal estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and\nnon-lease components.\nOperating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the\nlease commencement date based on the present value of the\nfuture minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future\nlease payments are discounted at a rate that represents the Firm\u2019s\ncollateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar\nterm and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities.\nThe operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and\nequipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial\ndirect costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental\nexpense associated with operating leases is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in\noccupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income.The following tables provide information related to the Firm\u2019s\noperating leases:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise\nnoted) 2020 2019\nRight-of-use assets $ 8,006 $ 8,190 \nLease liabilities 8,508 8,505 \nWeighted average remaining lease\nterm (in years) 8.7 8.8\nWeighted average discount rate 3.48 % 3.68 %\nSupplemental cash flow\ninformation\nCash paid for amounts included in\nthe measurement of lease liabilities\n- operating cash flows $ 1,626 $ 1,572 \nSupplemental non-cash\ninformation\nRight-of-use assets obtained in\nexchange for operating lease\nobligations $ 1,350 $ 1,413 \nYear ended December 31, \n(in millions) 2020 2019\nRental expense\nGross rental expense $ 2,094 $ 2,057 \nSublease rental income (166) (184)\nNet rental expense $ 1,928 $ 1,873 \nThe following table presents future payments under operating\nleases as of December 31, 2020:\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)\n2021 $ 1,606 \n2022 1,435 \n2023 1,270 \n2024 1,123 \n2025 947 \nAfter 2025 3,602 \nTotal future minimum lease payments 9,983 \nLess: Imputed interest (1,475)\nTotal $ 8,508 \nIn addition to the table above, as of December 31, 2020, the Firm\nhad additional future operating lease commitments of $1.2 billion\nthat were signed but had not yet commenced.

This method\nrequires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax\nconsequences of temporary differences between the carrying\namounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes.\nAccordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary\ndifference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm\nexpects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and\nexpense are realized.

The contractual amount of\nthese financial instruments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the\ncommitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under\nthe guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail\nto perform according to the terms of the contract.

The Firm can reduce or\ncancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice\nor, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition,\nthe Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60\ndays or more past due.

The Firm also issues\ncommitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn\nupon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of\ncredit.\nGuarantees\nU.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of\na guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the\nobligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines\na guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor\nto pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an\nunderlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed\nparty; or (b) a third party\u2019s failure to perform under a specified\nagreement. The Firm considers the following off\u2013balance sheet\narrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters\nof credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending\nindemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included\nwithin third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative\ncontracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo\nprogram.\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at\nthe inception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation\nassumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net\npresent value of the premium receivable). For these obligations,\nthe Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an\noffsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received),or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable\nrecorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the\ncontract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is\namortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the\nlife of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent\nobligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in\naddition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when\nthe liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These\nobligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than\nthe carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at\ninception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-\nlending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications\nprovided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale\nproceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or\nloss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these\nindemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the\nFirm\u2019s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification\nexpires).\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and\nindemnifications are included in the table on page 284.\nFor additional information on the guarantees, see below.\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are\nconditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee\nthe performance of a client or customer to a third party under\ncertain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond\nfinancings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and\nother letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n2020 2019\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)Standby letters of credit and \nother financial guaranteesOther letters \nof creditStandby letters of credit and \nother financial guaranteesOther letters \nof credit\nInvestment-grade $ 22,850 $ 2,263 $ 26,880 $ 2,137 \nNoninvestment-grade 8,132 790 7,362 824 \nTotal contractual amount $ 30,982 $ 3,053 $ 34,242 $ 2,961 \nAllowance for lending-related commitments $ 80 $ 14 $ 216 $ 4 \nGuarantee liability 363 \u2014 402 \u2014 \nTotal carrying value $ 443 $ 14 $ 618 $ 4 \nCommitments with collateral $ 17,238 $ 498 $ 17,853 $ 728 \n(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings.

As part of this program, the Firm provides an\nindemnification in the lending agreements which protects the\nlender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent\nsecurities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification\nagreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral\nwith a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities\non loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to\nhelp assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral\nis called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be\nreleased to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a\nborrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to\npurchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the\nlending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof.\nThe cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of\nthe client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm\nindemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To\nminimize its liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains\ncollateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the principal\ninvested.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees\nThe Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts\ninclude written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets\nupon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a\nspecified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put\noption contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading\npurposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years\nor less.\nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value\ncontracts, commonly referred to as \u201cstable value products\u201d, that\nrequire the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the\nmarket value and the book value of a counterparty\u2019s reference\nportfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book\nvalue and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value\nproducts are transacted in order to allow investors to realize\ninvestment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio.\nThese contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated\nmaturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under\ncertain conditions.\nThe notional value of derivatives guarantees generally represents\nthe Firm\u2019s maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain\nstable value products is contractually limited to a substantially\nlower percentage of the notional amount.\nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in\nthe Firm\u2019s view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform\nunder the contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts\nby entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into\ncontracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative\nguarantees.The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as\nguarantees as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(in millions)December 31,\n2020December 31,\n2019\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees $ 54,415 $ 53,089 \nStable value contracts with contractually\nlimited exposure 27,752 28,877 \nMaximum exposure of stable value\ncontracts with contractually limited\nexposure 2,803 2,967 \nFair value\nDerivative payables 322 159 \nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a\nguarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit\nprotection in the credit derivatives market.

Losses on\nrecourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales\nproceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than\nthe sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest\non the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying\nproperty. The Firm\u2019s securitizations are predominantly\nnonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future\ncredit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities\nissued by the trust. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the unpaid\nprincipal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $889 million\nand $944 million, respectively. The carrying value of the related\nliability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is\nrepresentative of the Firm\u2019s view of the likelihood it will have to\nperform under its recourse obligations, was $23 million and $27\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther off-balance sheet arrangements\nIndemnification agreements \u2013 general\nIn connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S.,\nthe Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the\nsecurities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain\ntypes of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the\nsecurities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the\nright to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are\npayable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in\nconnection with the licensing of software to clients (\u201csoftware\nlicensees\u201d) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party\n(\u201cthird-party purchasers\u201d), pursuant to which it indemnifies\nsoftware licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur\nsubsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party\npurchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the\nFirm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to\nestimate the Firm\u2019s maximum exposure under these\nindemnification arrangements, since this would require an\nassessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that\nmay be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred.\nHowever, based on historical experience, management expects\nthe risk of loss to be remote.\nMerchant charge-backs\nUnder the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a\nmerchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed\nprocessed credit and debit card transactions that result in a\ncharge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the\ncardholder\u2019s favor, Merchant Services will (through the\ncardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the\ncardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If\nMerchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the\nmerchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for the amount\ncredited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services\nmitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition,\nMerchantServices recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the\npayment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs.\nThe carrying value of the valuation allowance was $12 million and\n$11 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nMerchant Services processed an aggregate volume of $1,597.3\nbillion, $1,511.5 billion, and $1,366.1 billion, respectively.\nClearing Services \u2013 Client Credit Risk\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into\nsecurities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with\nCCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as\nOTC-cleared derivative contracts.

Such obligations vary\nwith different organizations. These obligations may be limited to\nthe amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm\u2019s contribution\nto the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange\nas part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event\nof a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also\ninclude a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the\nguarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the\nFirm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result\nfrom the clearing house\u2019s investment of guarantee fund\ncontributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of\nthe default of another member. Generally a payment would only be\nrequired should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing\nhouse or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the\nlosses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to\nestimate the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure under these\nmembership agreements, since this would require an assessment\nof future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not\nyet occurred. However, based on historical experience,\nmanagement expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote.\nWhere the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure can be estimated,\nthe amount is disclosed in the table on page 284, in the Exchange\n& clearing house guarantees and commitments line.\nSponsored member repo program\nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight\nresale and repurchase agreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\n(\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members\nunder the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the\nprompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored\nmember clients\u2019 respective obligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by\nobtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities\ncollateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore,\nthe Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the\nassociated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page 284. Refer to Note 11\nfor additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on\nresale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under\nrepurchase agreements.\nGuarantees of subsidiaries\nIn the normal course of business, the Parent Company may\nprovide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading\nand other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract\nbasis, as negotiated with the Firm\u2019scounterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on\nthe Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-\nbalance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has\nnot recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm\nbelieves that the occurrence of any event that would trigger\npayments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is\nremote.\nThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and\nstructured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase\nFinancial Company LLC (\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a 100%-owned and\nconsolidated finance subsidiary.

The litigations range from\nindividual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits\nwith potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve\nboth formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental\nagencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal\nproceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or\ninvestigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and\nseveral geographies and a wide variety of claims (including\ncommon law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust,\nsecurities and consumer protection claims), some of which present\nnovel legal theories.\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for\nits legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.5 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020. This estimated aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses was based upon information available\nas of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes\nthat an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For\ncertain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate\ncan be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate\nrange of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment,\ngiven:\n\u2022the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings,\nincluding the fact that many are in preliminary stages,\n\u2022the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants,\nincluding the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be\ndetermined,\n\u2022the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the\nproceedings, including issues regarding class certification and\nthe scope of many of the claims, and\n\u2022the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of\nsuch proceedings, including where the Firm has made\nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other\nadjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse\nparties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove\nto be incorrect.\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result\nwhich the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because\nthe Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote.\nAccordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and\nactual losses may vary significantly.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal\nproceedings.\nAdvisory and Other Activities. In November 2020, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. entered into a resolution with the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) regarding historical\ndeficiencies in internal controls and internal audit for certain\nfiduciary activities. In connection with the resolution, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. paid a $250 million Civil Money Penalty. The\nOCC found that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has remediated the\ndeficiencies that led to the penalty.\nAmrapali.

In 2017, numerous\ncreditors filed civil claims against Amrapali including petitions\nbrought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to\ndeliver residential units. The home buyers\u2019 petitions have been\noverseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its\njurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme\nCourt of India issued an order making preliminary findings that\nAmrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan\nChase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the\nprojects, violated certain currency control and money laundering\nprovisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under\nIndia\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign\nExchange Management Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d).

JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful.\nThe claim is ongoing and a trial has been scheduled to commence\nin February 2022.\nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm\npreviously reported settlements with certain government\nauthorities relating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading\nactivities and controls related to those activities. Among those\nresolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single\nviolation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was\nsentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of\nprobation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has\nconcluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout\nthe probation period. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a\nfive-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its\naffiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset\nManager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) until January 2023. The Firm will need to\nreapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the\nremainder of the ten-year disqualification period. A South Africa\nCompetition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related\ngovernmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the South\nAfrica Competition Tribunal.\nIn August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York granted final approval to the Firm\u2019s settlement\nof a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,\nwhich principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based\non an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates\nand also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in\nFX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the\nsettlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from\nthe class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm\nand a number of other foreign exchange dealers in November\n2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, putative\nclass actions have been filed against the Firm and a number of\nother foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers\nwho purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and\npurported indirect purchasers of FX instruments; these actions\nalso remain pending in the District Court. In 2020, the Court\napproved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants of a\nclass action filed by purported indirect purchasers for a total of\n$10 million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative\nclass actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have\nbeen filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and\nAustralia.\nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail\nassociations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that\nVisa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set\nthe price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted\nrelated rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties\ninitially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary\nreduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain\ncredit cardnetwork rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was\nreversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York for further\nproceedings consistent with the appellate decision.\nThe original class action was divided into two separate actions,\none seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking\nprimarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the\nclass action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which\namends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant\nto this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an\nadditional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously\nheld in escrow from the original settlement.

The Court of Appeal found in\nJanuary 2021 that it had no power to take further action against\nJPMorgan Chase following the Court of Cassation\u2019s ruling. At the\nopening of a trial of the managers of Wendel in January 2021, the\ntribunal correctionnel directed the criminal authorities to clarify\nwhether a further investigation should be opened against\nJPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was postponed. In\naddition, a number of the managers have commenced civil\nproceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are\nseparate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of\nproceedings.\n* * *\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above,\nJPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or\nare otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal\nproceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the\nclaims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal\nproceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional\nlegal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.\nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its\ncurrently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the\nprovisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a\nlitigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has\nbeen incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably\nestimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings\neach quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes\nadjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as\nappropriate, based on management\u2019s best judgment after\nconsultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal expense was $1.1\nbillion, $239 million and $72 million for the years ended December\n31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There is no assurance that\nthe Firm\u2019s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the\nfuture.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal\nproceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal\ntheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of\ndiscovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the\neventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of\ntheir ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or\nconsequences related to those matters.

The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis\nstarts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and\neach of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.\nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and\ntax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a\nbasis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This\nallows management to assess the comparability of revenue from\nyear-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.\nThe corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items\nis recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These\nadjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the\nFirm as a whole or by the LOBs.\nBusiness segment capital allocation\nEach business segment is allocated capital by taking into\nconsideration a variety of factors including capital levels of\nsimilarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected\nreturns are established as key measures of a business segment\u2019s\nperformance.\nThe Firm\u2019s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III\nStandardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge,\nand a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. The\nassumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are\nperiodically assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the\nLOBs may change from time to time. Business segment changes\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm transferred certain assets,\nliabilities, revenue, expense and headcount associated with certain\nwealth management clients from AWM to the J.P. Morgan Wealth\nManagement business unit within CCB. Prior-period amounts have\nbeen revised to conform with the current presentation, including the\ntransfer of approximately 1,650 technology and support staff during\nthe second and third quarters of 2020. Ultra-high-net-worth and\ncertain high-net-worth client relationships remained in AWM.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale\nPayments business unit within CIB following a realignment of the\nFirm\u2019s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments\nbusiness comprises:\n\u2022Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB\n\u2022Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was\npreviously reported in Lending in CIB.\nIn connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets,\nliabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Services\nbusiness were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and\nexpenses of the Merchant Services business are reported across\nCCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. In the\nfourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with\nthe associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB\u2019s\nWholesale Payments business from CCB and CB.

net interest income, volume and rate analysis\nThe table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate is calculated\nusing annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages\n300\u2013304 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it\nhas been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in\ncomposition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without\nconsideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on\nliabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different\nattribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently\ncomplex and judgmental.\n2020 versus 2019 2019 versus 2018\n(Unaudited)Increase/(decrease) due to\nchange in:Increase/(decrease) due to\nchange in:\nYear ended December 31,\n(On a taxable-equivalent basis; in millions) Volume RateNet\nchange Volume RateNet\nchange\nInterest-earning assets\nDeposits with banks:\nU.S. $ 333 $ (3,153)$ (2,820) $ (3,030)$ 915 $ (2,115)\nNon-U.S. (8) (310) (318) 35 60 95 \nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements:\nU.S. (83) (2,644) (2,727) 1,304 337 1,641 \nNon-U.S. 81 (1,064) (983) 168 518 686 \nSecurities borrowed:\nU.S. (24) (1,704) (1,728) 236 362 598 \nNon-U.S. (1) (147) (148) 2 61 63 \nTrading assets \u2013 debt instruments:\nU.S. 365 (1,466) (1,101) 2,416 (488) 1,928 \nNon-U.S. 336 (555) (219) 253 (198) 55 \nInvestment securities:\nU.S. 3,426 (3,686) (260) 2,723 (703) 2,020 \nNon-U.S. 38 (115) (77) (79) 36 (43)\nLoans:  \nU.S. 557 (7,907) (7,350) 890 1,941 2,831 \nNon-U.S. 74 (850) (776) (122) 95 (27)\nAll other interest-earning assets, predominantly U.S. 324 (1,447) (1,123) 48 63 111 \nChange in interest income 5,418 (25,048) (19,630) 4,844 2,999 7,843 \nInterest-bearing liabilities\nInterest-bearing deposits:\nU.S. 495 (5,103) (4,608) 407 1,927 2,334 \nNon-U.S. 25 (2,017) (1,992) 165 485 650 \nFederal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase\nagreements:\nU.S. 176 (3,302) (3,126) 1,133 294 1,427 \nNon-U.S. (51) (395) (446) (85) 222 137 \nTrading liabilities \u2013 debt, short-term and all other interest-bearing\nliabilities: \nU.S. 2 (2,606) (2,604) (5) 354 349 \nNon-U.S. 36 (698) (662) 30 (77) (47)\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, predominantly U.S. (37) (317) (354) 37 38 75 \nLong-term debt:\nU.S. 131 (3,193) (3,062) 93 719 812 \nNon-U.S. 6 13 19 17 \u2014 17 \nIntercompany funding:\nU.S. (89) 249 160 293 (961) (668)\nNon-U.S.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2993, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cb6a537-7803-4997-a046-2f811d79d596": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cb6a537-7803-4997-a046-2f811d79d596", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "306", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0c2fb9cc-1980-425b-bc36-14431447f9d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "306", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d9f30faad17b3f3a6c2cc34347553d532c0bbc8e2391bb9a99f5ac5b166f14bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4cd254e-b9f3-4163-b291-d2378891ebb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "306", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f17e1bef3b7e7e3f12cae2a8316a61dff093633a8c20dae3ab6de88978703a02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "daf07821-781b-4750-8289-a048b6bc2e81", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f86da3607866f4bcefe6078748bc8a735db72109b84eb9c828a61bd9e9627ed3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ccbe16b325a33be179d947f929ee40fbf917e6357a426d0f2a4c20e4eaabed58", "text": "(51) (395) (446) (85) 222 137 \nTrading liabilities \u2013 debt, short-term and all other interest-bearing\nliabilities: \nU.S. 2 (2,606) (2,604) (5) 354 349 \nNon-U.S. 36 (698) (662) 30 (77) (47)\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, predominantly U.S. (37) (317) (354) 37 38 75 \nLong-term debt:\nU.S. 131 (3,193) (3,062) 93 719 812 \nNon-U.S. 6 13 19 17 \u2014 17 \nIntercompany funding:\nU.S. (89) 249 160 293 (961) (668)\nNon-U.S. 89 (249) (160) (293) 961 668 \nChange in interest expense 783 (17,618) (16,835) 1,792 3,962 5,754 \nChange in net interest income $ 4,635 $ (7,430)$ (2,795) $ 3,052 $ (963)$ 2,089 \n(a)Negative interest income and yield are related to the impact of current interest rates combined with the fees paid on client-driven securities borrowed balances.

Alt-A lending characteristics may\ninclude one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)\na high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied\nproperties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A\nsubstantial proportion of the Firm\u2019s Alt-A loans are those where a\nborrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her\nassets or the amount or source of his or her income.\nOption ARMs\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate\nmortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each\nmonth to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum\npayment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based\non the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This\nintroductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed\nrate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a\nmargin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum\npayment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the\nprior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to\npayment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully\namortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and\nanniversary datetriggers.\nPrime\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit\nrecords who meet specific underwriting requirements, including\nprescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt\nlevels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation\nand generally have reliable payment histories.\nSubprime\nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to\ncertain customers with one or more high risk characteristics,\nincluding but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories;\n(ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid\nmortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an\noccupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower\u2019s primary\nresidence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the\nloan.\nMSA: Metropolitan statistical areas\nMSR: Mortgage servicing rights\nMulti-asset: Any fund or account that allocates assets under\nmanagement to more than one asset class.\nNA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.\nNAV: Net Asset Value\nNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934.\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net charge-\noffs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans\nfor the reporting period.\nNet interchange income includes the following components:\n\u2022Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit card\nissuers on sales transactions.\n\u2022Reward costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by\ncardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs generally\ntied to sales transactions.\n\u2022Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners\nbased on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by\ncardholders on credit card transactions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4494, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5826f48-b077-4e1a-81bc-22b83fcce498": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5826f48-b077-4e1a-81bc-22b83fcce498", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "310", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34c96eb1-1796-434a-ab4d-abfad04a5afb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "310", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b16e87f2f8aad0f7c824225f897d31bd679a7839c1bb3e3034aa7d4bfc2c5a6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc0d49df-78da-47b4-a6ac-191cd7814fc9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "310", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "decb5dff21705032c36d358e5e4f4680585743676e08f96cac7bdf8281fe830f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f49208ec-6a73-4579-875b-ee482ea27b08", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "38aea22a141add273db1fd0f78a0893e2e16025cbde5960cd68d26394ad820f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "910a4d345bc10e6b4d6f7f9a34b4b502c8f903470833261488c86b3ac348fb7c", "text": "MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas\nMSR: Mortgage servicing rights\nMulti-asset: Any fund or account that allocates assets under\nmanagement to more than one asset class.\nNA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.\nNAV: Net Asset Value\nNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934.\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net charge-\noffs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans\nfor the reporting period.\nNet interchange income includes the following components:\n\u2022Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit card\nissuers on sales transactions.\n\u2022Reward costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by\ncardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs generally\ntied to sales transactions.\n\u2022Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners\nbased on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by\ncardholders on credit card transactions.\nNet mortgage servicing revenue: Includes operating revenue\nearned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is\nrecognized over the period in which the service is provided;\nchanges in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk management\nactivities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on\nsecuritization of excess mortgage servicing.

Because each depositary share represents a 1/400 interest in a share of Listed Preferred Stock, holders\nof depositary receipts will be entitled to 1/400 of a vote per depositary share under those limited circumstances in which holders of the\nListed Preferred Stock are entitled to a vote. \nWhen the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of a series of Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the\ndepositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to that Listed Preferred\nStock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the applicable\nListed Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by the holder\u2019s depositary\nshares. To the extent practicable, the depositary will vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in\naccordance with the instructions it receives. We will agree to take all actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the\ndepositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares\nrepresenting the Listed Preferred Stock, it will abstain from voting with respect to such shares.\nWithdrawal of Listed Preferred Stock. Underlying shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn from the depositary arrangement upon\nsurrender of depositary receipts at the depositary\u2019s office and upon payment of the taxes, charges and fees provided for in the deposit\nagreement. Subject to the terms of the relevant deposit agreement, the holder of depositary receipts will receive the appropriate number of\nshares of Listed Preferred Stock represented by such depositary shares. Only whole shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn; if a\nholder holds an amount other than a whole multiple of 400 depositary shares, the depositary will deliver along with the withdrawn shares of\nListed Preferred Stock a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of depositary shares. Holders of withdrawn shares of Listed\nPreferred Stock will not be entitled to redeposit such shares or to receive depositary shares.\nForm and Notices. Each series of Listed Preferred Stock was issued in registered form to the depositary, and the depositary shares\nrepresenting that Listed Preferred Stock were issued in book-entry only form through DTC. The depositary will forward to the holders of\ndepositary shares all reports, notices, and communications from us that are delivered to the depositary and that we are required to furnish to\nthe holders of the Listed Preferred Stock.\nAmendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement. We and the depositary may amend any form of depositary receipt evidencing\ndepositary shares and any provision of any deposit agreement at any time regarding any depositary shares. However, any amendment that\nmaterially and adversely alters the rights of the holders of depositary shares representing a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock or\nwould be materially and adversely inconsistent with the rights granted to holders of that underlying Listed Preferred Stock pursuant to our\ncertificate of incorporation will not be effective unless the amendment has been approved by the holders of at least a majority of the related\ndepositary shares then outstanding. The deposit agreement relating to the depositary shares representing a particular series of Listed\nPreferred Stock may be terminated by us or by the depositary only if:\n\u2022all such outstanding depositary shares have been redeemed; or\n\u2022there has been a final distribution of the relevant underlying Listed Preferred Stock in connection with our liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up and the preferred stock has been distributed to the holders of depositary receipts.\nCharges of Depositary. We will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary\narrangements regarding any depositary shares. We also pay charges of the depositary in connection with the initial deposit of each series of\nListed Preferred Stock and any redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock. Holders of depositary receipts will pay transfer and other taxes and\ngovernmental charges and other charges with respect to their depositary receipts as expressly provided in the deposit agreement.\nResignation and Removal of Depositary.

MLPs are limited partnerships primarily engaged in the exploration, marketing, mining, processing, production, refining,\nstorage, or transportation of any mineral or natural resource.\nDenominations\nThe Alerian ETNs are denominated in U.S. dollars in minimum denominations equal to the $19.03661 per note (the \u201cPrincipal Amount\u201d),\nwhich is the amount equal to the Initial VWAP Level (defined below), divided by ten.\nCoupon Payments and the Accrued Tracking Fee\nFor each Alerian ETN a holder holds on the applicable Coupon Record Date, holders will receive on each Coupon Payment Date the\n\u201cCoupon Amount,\u201d which is an amount in cash equal to the difference between (a) the Reference Distribution Amount (defined below),\ncalculated as of the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date and (b) the Accrued Tracking Fee (defined below), calculated as of the\ncorresponding Coupon Valuation Date.\nThe Accrued Tracking Fee accrues on a daily basis at a rate of 0.85% per annum, applied to the Daily Note Value as of the Index Business\nDay immediately preceding the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date. The Daily Note Value reflects the cumulative performance of the\nVWAP Level of the Index since April 1, 2009, which we refer to as the Inception Date. If the Daily Note Value increases, the Accrued Tracking\nFee will increase, and if the Daily Note Value decreases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will decrease. The Daily Note Value is published on the\nBloomberg Professional service (\u201cBloomberg\u201d) under the ticker symbol \u201cAMJIVWAP\u201d and on Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol\n\u201cAMJIVWAP:IND.\u201d\nOn any Index Business Day, the VWAP Level reflects the weighted VWAPs of the Index Components, and the VWAP of each Index\nComponent is the volume-weighted average price of one share of that Index Component as determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent\nbased on the Primary Exchange for that Index Component.\nTo the extent the Reference Distribution Amount on any Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the corresponding\nCoupon Valuation Date, there will be no coupon payment made on the corresponding Coupon Payment Date, and an amount equal to the\ndifference between the Accrued Tracking Fee and the Reference Distribution Amount (the \u201cTracking Fee Shortfall\u201d) will be included in the\nAccrued Tracking Fee for the next Coupon Valuation Date. This will be in addition to the accrual at a rate of 0.85% per annum over the\nquarter that has elapsed since the previous date of determination. This process will be repeated to the extent necessary until the Reference\nDistribution Amount for a Coupon Valuation Date is greater than the Accrued Tracking Fee for the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date\n(which includes the accumulated Tracking Fee Shortfall from all prior quarters). This process may also restart as necessary on a subsequent\nCoupon Valuation Date. Coupon payments on the Alerian ETNs will be payable quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth Index Business Day\nfollowing each Coupon Valuation Date, provided that the final Coupon Payment Date will be the Maturity Date. The final Coupon Amount will\nbe included in the Cash Settlement Amount.\nHolders will receive no coupon payment on a Coupon Payment Date if the Reference Distribution Amount on the relevant Coupon Valuation\nDate is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the relevant Coupon Valuation Date.\nOn each Index Business Day, the Note Calculation Agent will calculate the value of the Coupon Amount as of the immediately preceding\nIndex Business Day (treating that immediately preceding Index Business Day as if it were a Coupon Valuation Date), which we refer to as the\ninterim accrued Coupon Amount, and will publish the interim accrued Coupon Amount on Bloomberg under the ticker symbol \u201cAMJEU\u201d and\non Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol \u201cAMJEU:IND.\u201d While the interim accrued Coupon Amount is calculated and published in\nconnection with each such Index Business Day, the actual Coupon Amount will be calculated and paid only once each quarter.\nPayment Upon Early Repurchase\nSubject to a holder's compliance with the procedures and the potential postponements and adjustments as described under \u201cMarket\nDisruption Events\u201d below, that holder may submit a request once a week (generally on or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on\nThursday) during the term of the Alerian ETNs to have us repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs, provided that holder requests that we\nrepurchase a minimum of 50,000 Alerian ETNs.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4490, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "056fb139-8471-4e42-bc6a-db481fbee60b": {"__data__": {"id_": "056fb139-8471-4e42-bc6a-db481fbee60b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "335", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "87abea2d-42d8-4eb5-8443-0cb9ffe34c97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "335", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6a044df0c05fc43662bc15aa1a9cbbb618f79be493d9b887a1a998d263fd0b12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "67bee422-45d7-486a-b37a-f7db89d333c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "335", "file_name": "JPMC2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4957229, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "eaf45967cf504427d55b783b754bdaf1e25420818524c84690c0224bff63de41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e299c309-4ac3-4391-9e5b-12ab0f031251", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "788e38f668d5c9e7f4c997f58e3b673e84590669a9b785d2144b90a592012fbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3ad96c8cb0f9f54428cfc0ba86934192f1fa6e2e59b547590ab00dfe580f9be5", "text": "Payment Upon Early Repurchase\nSubject to a holder's compliance with the procedures and the potential postponements and adjustments as described under \u201cMarket\nDisruption Events\u201d below, that holder may submit a request once a week (generally on or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on\nThursday) during the term of the Alerian ETNs to have us repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs, provided that holder requests that we\nrepurchase a minimum of 50,000 Alerian ETNs.

If\nthe Cash Settlement Amount is $0 or less, the payment at maturity will be $0.\nThe Cash Settlement Amount is calculated by adjusting the Principal Amount to reflect:\n\u2022    the return of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the Final VWAP Level;\n\u2022    the addition of the final Coupon Amount, if any,\n\u2022    the deduction of the Accrued Tracking Fee; and\n\u2022    the addition of certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Final Measurement Period.\nThe Final Measurement Period is a five Index Business Day period near the Maturity Date of the Alerian ETNs during which the Final VWAP\nLevel will be determined.\nFor purposes of determining the Cash Settlement Amount, the Final VWAP Level will be the arithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels measured\non each Index Business Day in the Final Measurement Period, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent. The Initial VWAP Level is the\narithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels measured on each Index Business Day over a three Index Business Day period ending on the Inception\nDate, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent.\nHolders may lose some or all of their investment at maturity.

Morgan Securities LLC, or JPMS (the \u201cNote Calculation Agent\u201d), will make all necessary calculations and determinations in connection\nwith the Alerian ETNs, including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Alerian ETNs, other those to be made by\nthe VWAP Calculation Agent described below.\nVWAP Calculation Agent\nThe JPMorgan Global Index Research Group (the \u201cVWAP Calculation Agent\u201d), one of our affiliates, will on each day that is not a Disrupted\nDay (as defined below) act as the VWAP Calculation Agent.

(Section 5.01)\nIf an Event of Default occurs and is continuing because of a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts payable on the debt\nsecurities, a failure in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement applicable to the Issuer, the guarantee ceasing to be in full\nforce and effect, or any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of security,\neither the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding,\ntreated as one class, by written notice to the Issuer and the Guarantor, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities of such\nseries and any interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. If a default due to specified events of the Issuer\u2019s bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is continuing, the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest\naccrued thereon will automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any holder, become immediately\ndue and payable. Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived by the holders of a\nmajority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 5.10)\nEvents of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not constitute an Event of\nDefault with respect to any series of debt securities. In addition, failure by the Guarantor to perform any of its covenants or warranties (other\nthan a payment default) will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities. Therefore, events of bankruptcy,\nresolution, receivership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor (in the absence of any such event occurring with\nrespect to the Issuer) will not permit any of the debt securities to be declared due and payable and the Trustee is not authorized to exercise\nany remedy against the Issuer or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor. Instead,\neven if an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor has occurred, the\nTrustee and the holders of debt securities of a series will not be able to declare the relevant debt securities to be immediately due and\npayable unless there is an Event of Default with respect to that series as described above, such as the Issuer\u2019s bankruptcy, insolvency,\nreceivership, winding up or liquidation or a payment default by the Issuer or the Guarantor on the relevant debt securities. The value holders\nreceive on any series of debt securities may be significantly less than what holders would have otherwise received had the\nIssuer\u2019s debt securities been declared due and payable immediately or the Trustee been authorized to exercise any remedy against\nthe Issuer or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.\nAn Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to any other\nseries of debt securities.

If for any reason the Issuer does not make any required payment in\nrespect of the Issuer\u2019s debt securities when due, the Guarantor will on demand pay the unpaid amount at the same place and in the same\nmanner that applies to payments made by the Issuer under the 2016 Indenture. The guarantee is of payment and not of collection. (Section\n14.01)\nThe Guarantor\u2019s obligations under the guarantee are unconditional and absolute. However, (1) the Guarantor will not be liable for any\namount of payment that the Issuer is excused from making or any amount in excess of the amount actually due and owing by the Issuer, and\n(2) any defense or counterclaims available to the Issuer (except those resulting solely from, or on account of, the Issuer\u2019s insolvency or the\nIssuer\u2019s status as debtor or subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding) will also be available to the Guarantor to the same extent as\nthese defense or counterclaims are available to the Issuer, whether or not asserted by the Issuer.

The Bank of New York Mellon and, for notes settled\nthrough Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying\nagents, authenticating agents, registrars and transfer agents for debt securities issued under the 2016 Indenture.\nDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the Trustee for the debt securities issued under our 2016 Indenture, to which\nJPMorgan Chase acts as a guarantor, the warrants issued under our warrant indenture, to which JPMorgan Chase acts as a guarantor, and\nthe debt securities issued under JPMorgan Chase\u2019s indenture. Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect to\nany of these securities, the Trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as\namended.
