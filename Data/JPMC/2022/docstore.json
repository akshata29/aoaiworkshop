These proposals are subject to further review by the\nEuropean Parliament and European Council.\nThe EU has adopted mandatory buy-in rules under the Central\nSecurities Depositories Regulation (\u201cCSDR\u201d) which will impose\nrequirements relating to sourcing of securities in the event of a\nsettlement fail. In June 2022, EU regulators proposed an amendment\nto postpone the application of these rules until November 2025. The\namendment remains subject to review by the European Parliament\nand European Council.\nIn December 2022, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an\nextensive package of reforms to U.K. financial services regulation\nknown as the \u201cEdinburgh Reforms\u201d. These reforms aim to drive\ngrowth and competitiveness in the U.K. financial services sector\nfollowing the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU. The reform package\nincludes initiatives relating to a number of areas of financial services\npolicy, including retail banks, payments, markets, digital assets and\nsustainable finance. The U.K. Government and regulators are\nexpected to release further consultations and announcements related\nto these reforms in 2023.\nEU and U.K. regulators are expected to finalize the rules\nimplementing the Basel III framework during 2023. The Firm\u2019s\nbanking entities in the EU and the U.K. will be required to comply with\nthe Basel III final rules by January 2025, allowing for certain\ntransitional arrangements until 2030 and 2032, respectively. The main\nchanges implemented by the Basel III final rules will be revisions to\nthe credit risk and operational risk calculation methods to reduce the\nuse of and reliance on internal modelling approaches and introduce\ninternationally-agreed changes to the market risk framework. The EU\nBasel III final rules also strengthen enforcement tools for supervisors\noverseeing EU banks and require EU banking entities to\nsystematically identify, disclose and manage environmental, social\nand governance (\u201cESG\u201d) risks as part of their risk management\npractices. In addition, in December 2022, the European Banking\nAuthority (\u201cEBA\u201d) announced that it will publish rules and technical\nstandards between 2023 and 2025 related to sustainable finance,\nwhich will be applicable to EU banks. The Firm\u2019s banking entities in\nthe U.K. will be required to comply with regulatory policies and\nstandards related to climate risk being developed by the PRA. In\naddition, EU legislation requires that certain non-EU banks operating\nin the EU establish an intermediate parent undertaking (\u201cIPU\u201d) located\nin the EU. The IPU legislation allows a second IPU to be established if\na single IPU would conflict with \u201chome country\u201d bank separation rules\nor impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to comply with the\nEU\u2019s IPU requirements by December 30, 2023.\nThe Firm\u2019s banking entities in the EU and U.K. are also subject to\nsupervisory expectations published by the ECBand the PRA, respectively, for management of financial risks arising\nfrom climate change and the increasing operational reliance on IT\nsystems, third-party services and innovative technologies, as well as\nsupervisory expectations for operational resilience and resilience from\nmacro-financial and geopolitical shocks. These expectations address\nbank strategy, governance, risk management, scenario analysis, risk\nreporting and disclosure.\nPolicymakers in the EU have continued to implement sustainability-\nrelated initiatives. In December 2022, the Corporate Sustainability\nReporting Directive (\u201cCSRD\u201d) was published in the Official Journal of\nthe EU. The CSRD will replace and significantly expand the scope\nand content of ESG reporting requirements under the EU\u2019s existing\nESG reporting rules. CSRD reporting requirements will be phased in\nbeginning in 2024. In addition, the EC published its legislative\nproposal on the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive\n(\u201cCSDDD\u201d) in February 2022. The draft directive sets mandatory due\ndiligence obligations for companies to address actual and potential\nhuman rights violations and environmental adverse impacts stemming\nfrom their own operations and business relationships, including the\nactivities of companies with which they have established business\nrelationships. The proposed legislation may also require the adoption\nof company-specific climate-related transition plans. The CSDDD is\ncurrently subject to review by the European Parliament and European\nCouncil. Both the CSRD and CSDDD will apply to certain of the Firm\u2019s\nEU entities as well as to certain non-EU entities.\n8", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4728, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a43a689-03c7-491b-9e25-4723ad7e19c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a43a689-03c7-491b-9e25-4723ad7e19c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "96e71424-2d41-4182-b8d4-1bede838dfe6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "419e4b633ad2543e623285118b757a0a7643e22341648d4ab9baa011e3335d34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "93ddae2a-fcf3-43ce-938b-a54baa344756", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9f627022f61678fe9d0561a733751dd8e222e7a3f4b3e6ee26d9a3623668d247", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "382c4d7a-226d-4f31-8fbb-490de12df8c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "db9ab14e461cd16b7242d187b98c508b2b8f78929d1ce77a60929758165258bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cf1fb12922fa505a3a7be616b30207ee497e48f9caf82b830886c7b00192e0d0", "text": "Item 1A.

JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and\nregulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around\nthe world in which it does business, and financial services firms such\nas JPMorgan Chase are subject to extensive regulation and\nsupervision.\nThe regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase significantly\naffects the way that it conducts its business and structures its\noperations, and JPMorgan Chase could be required to make changes\nto its business and operations in response to supervisory\nexpectations or decisions or to new or changed laws, rules and\nregulations. These types of developments could result in JPMorgan\nChase incurring additional costs in connection with complying with\napplicable laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its\nprofitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s entry into or acquisition\nof a new business or an increase in its principal investments may\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional laws, rules, and\nregulations.\nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and\nexpanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and\ncould in the future be, required to:\n\u2022limit the products and services that it offers\n\u2022reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making\nactivities\u2022refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might\notherwise pursue\n\u2022pay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum global tax\nregime), assessments, levies or other governmental charges,\nincluding in connection with the resolution of tax examinations\n\u2022incur losses, including with respect to fraudulent transactions\nperpetrated against its customers\n\u2022dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are\ndisadvantageous\n\u2022impose restrictions on certain business activities, or\n\u2022increase the prices that it charges for products and services,\nwhich could reduce the demand for them.\nAny failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the laws, rules and\nregulations to which it is subject could result in:\n\u2022increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny\n\u2022regulatory and governmental enforcement actions\n\u2022the imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\u2022increased exposure to litigation, or\n\u2022harm to its reputation.\nDifferences and inconsistencies in financial services regulation\ncan negatively impact JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, operations\nand financial results.\nThe content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting\nfinancial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as\nthe size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or\noperates, and other criteria. For example:\n\u2022larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject to more\nstringent supervision, regulation and regulatory scrutiny\n\u2022financial technology companies and other non-traditional\ncompetitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be\nsupervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not\nhave the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory\nagencies which supervise more diversified financial services\nfirms, or\n\u2022the financial services regulatory framework in a particular\njurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that\njurisdiction.\nThese types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in\nJPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less\nregulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to\nunregulated financial products.\nThere can also be significant differences in the ways that similar\nregulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are\nimplemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which\nJPMorgan Chase does business.

JPMorgan Chase has paid\nsignificant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other\npenalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with\nresolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental\nagencies.

As a result, the Parent Company\u2019s losses and any losses\nincurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the\nParent Company\u2019s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured\ncreditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities.\nClaims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to\nthe claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries and to the\nclaims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of\nthe Parent Company.\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy,\nholders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent\nCompany would realize value only to the extent available to the\nParent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and\nsecured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid.\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry\nrecapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a\nsystemically important financial institution, such as the Parent\nCompany, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted\na single point of entry resolution strategy.\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution,\nnone of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is\nobligated to follow JPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred resolution strategy,\nand losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is\nultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred strategy.Political\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by political\ndevelopments can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses.\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other countries can cause\nuncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses.

Furthermore, if a significant and sustained\ndeterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital markets businesses, including its loan\nsyndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities,\ncould be reduced to the extent that those businesses:\n\u2022earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including\nwhen clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding\ndebt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or\n\u2022dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger\nresidual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at\nfavorable prices.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the\neconomy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas\nprices or an increase in commodity prices, or sustained changes in\nconsumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors, could have\na material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose\noperations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on\nthe health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors,\nas well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan\nChase could incur credit losses on its loans and other credit\ncommitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any\nsector of the economy that is under stress.\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or\nholding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by\ndeclining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions.\nFor example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets\ncould affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase\nmanages or\n15", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5169, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2009c32-85b1-4d3e-ad70-6170415a1a9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2009c32-85b1-4d3e-ad70-6170415a1a9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "094042a5-f969-436b-b1d6-078ea141b2cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "cdc2769222ea17f5527686040e796833592d483e07c93411d3ce1059e855acfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "67c47304-07fb-4f63-8323-1952139b0a5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6ca71b07465176c78f05cfacafd96830c03b9b1705faa716766e588cf465318e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4752b00a-d780-4c45-a476-861f8b9df9e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b5c82527b8f335d6148f378d21f984e0ad4d7f46b4d350345d2154f3c8bc318", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "23a13b2e9dace53fac4a4edbedbf0f44ceead48b84ad41ae5ab49a93ed801034", "text": "Part I\nholds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nrevenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under\nmanagement or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market\nconditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or\naccounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower\nrevenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan\nChase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund,\nparticularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of\nfund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to\nfurther withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior\nthat results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also\nhave a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale\nclients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its\nwholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent\nstreams of rental income from commercial real estate properties\nwhich are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse\neconomic conditions could result in reductions in the rental cash flows\nthat owners or developers receive from their tenants which, in turn,\ncould depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of\nborrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans.\nThese consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies,\ndefaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan\nportfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of\ndelinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nearnings from its wholesale businesses.\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings, its liquidity or its capital levels.\nWhen interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorgan Chase can\ngenerally be expected to earn higher net interest income. However,\nhigher interest rates can also lead to:\n\u2022fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans\n\u2022losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific\ndowngrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and\nnet charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients\n\u2022the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits\nbecause they believe that interest rates offered by JPMorgan\nChase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorgan Chase\nmakes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior\n\u2022losses on available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities held in the\ninvestment securities portfolio\n\u2022lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate\nincreases more quickly than anticipatedand this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and\nlong-term borrowings\n\u2022less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n\u2022higher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nearnings or its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can\nalso negatively affect the payment performance on loans within\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are\nlinked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are\nunable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may\nreduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase\nto incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a\nhigher volume of delinquent loans.\nOn the other hand, a low or negative interest rate environment may\ncause:\n\u2022net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the\namounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities\nportfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest\ncontemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n\u2022unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which\ncould negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s broader asset and\nliability management strategy, and\n\u2022a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s mortgage servicing\nrights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for\nJPMorgan Chase to borrow.

JPMorgan Chase can also\nbe subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has\nappointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds\nbecomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by\nexisting laws and obligations, or where clients are unable to access\nassets held by JPMorgan Chase as custodian due to governmental\nactions or other factors.\nA default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through\nwhich JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan\nChase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational\ncosts and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\ncan be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan\nChase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP\nbecause of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a\nportion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be\nsubject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP,\nincluding losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or\ndue to cyber or other security breaches.\nAs part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is exposed\nto the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate\nby requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is\nalso exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with\nproviding cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction\nservices to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase\nprovides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan\nChase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation\nwith one or more CCPs, the client\u2019s bankruptcy estate and other\ncreditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the\nforegoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational andlitigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent\nthat any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those\nlosses.\nTransactions with government entities, including national, state,\nprovincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan\nChase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation\nrisks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that\nactions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority\nof those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous\nincumbent government. These types of actions have in the past\ncaused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase to suffer\nlosses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant\njurisdiction.\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a\ncounterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon\npayments, which could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with\nregard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of\nunderlying collateral.

This type of\ninterrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit, liquidity\nand market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses,\nincluding fair value losses in its market-making businesses and\ninvestment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required\nto increase the allowance for credit losses with respect to certain\nclients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of\nits banking regulators.\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular\nindustry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit\nquality of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or counterparties not only in\nthat particular industry or geography but in related or dependent\nindustries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten\nconcerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nconsumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those\naffected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their\nobligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors\nvarious segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess\nthe potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its ability to\ndiversify or hedge its exposure against those risks may be limited.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an\nexcessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank\ncompetitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer\nloans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant\nreductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of\nloans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers\nsubsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit\nprofiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their\nability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in\nhigher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly,\nwidespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary\nconditions in theU.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses may\nearn lower revenues in such an environment.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a\nmarket dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks\nassociated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted-assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These\nfactors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital position,\nfunding costs and the profitability of its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses could be\nimpaired if its liquidity is constrained.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by\nfactors such as:\n\u2022market-wide illiquidity or disruption\n\u2022unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result\nof changes in laws, rules and regulations\n\u2022inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices\n\u2022default by a CCP or other significant market participant\n\u2022unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\n\u2022unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated\ndraws on lending-related commitments, and\n\u2022lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or\nfinancial institutions in general.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity may be caused by events\nover which it has little or no control.

example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities,\nderivatives and other financial instruments are still linked to the\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) benchmark, and significant\nprogress has been made by regulators, industry bodies and market\nparticipants to introduce and implement the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as a replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR.\nHowever, if market participants have not implemented effective\noperational and other arrangements to address the transition from\nU.S. dollar LIBOR to SOFR, this could result in dislocation in the\nfinancial markets, volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and\nother instruments, and the suppression of capital markets activities,\nall of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nresults of operations and on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit\nor other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held by\nJPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other\ntypes of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors\nas a consequence of the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other\nbenchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that\nJPMorgan Chase has:\n\u2022treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or\ncaused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower\nreturns on investments\n\u2022failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition\nfrom benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has\nsold to its clients and customers, or failed to disclose purported\nconflicts of interest\n\u2022made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments\non behalf of its clients, or sold

Chase\u2019s ability to support business activities,\nmeet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to\nshareholders.\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital\nrequirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital\nrequirements. In addition, as a Globally SystemicallyImportant Bank (\u201cGSIB\u201d), JPMorgan Chase is required to hold\nadditional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a Stress\nCapital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d), and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is\nreassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that JPMorgan\nChase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverage-and risk-\nbased requirements could increase at any given time due to factors\nsuch as:\n\u2022actions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules,\nand regulations\n\u2022actions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S. government in\nresponse to the economic effects of systemic events, such as the\nactions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to\nan expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in\ndeposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial\ninstitutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage exposure\nand the GSIB surcharge\n\u2022changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s balance sheet\nor developments that could increase RWA, such as increased\nmarket risk, customer delinquencies, client credit rating\ndowngrades or other factors, and\n\u2022increases in estimated stress losses as determined by the\nFederal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and\nReview, which could increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s SCB.\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required\nlevel and

Any significant failure in this\nregard could diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate one or\nmore of its businesses or result in:\n\u2022potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers\n\u2022increased operating expenses\n\u2022higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and\nother sanctions\n\u2022damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\n\u2022impairment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity\n\u2022regulatory intervention, or\n\u2022weaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational costs and customer satisfaction\ncould be adversely affected by the failure of an external\noperational system.\nExternal operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected,\nwhether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to\nJPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a\nsystems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor\nor market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly\nconnected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving\nanother party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected.\nSimilarly, retailers, payment systems and processors, data\naggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncustomers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational\nrisk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or other\nparties are beyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s security and control systems,\nincluding through the use of the internet, cloud computing services,\nand personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services.\nIf an external party obtains access to customer account data on\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems, whether authorized or unauthorized, and\nthat party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or\nmisappropriates that data, this couldresult in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its\nclients and customers, including:\n\u2022heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute\nfraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems\n\u2022losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability\nfor losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer\nprotection laws, rules and regulations\n\u2022increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the\nexternal party\u2019s security breach, and\n\u2022reputational harm arising from the perception that JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s systems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorgan Chase\u2019s interconnectivity with clients, customers and\nother external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase\nincreasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with\nrespect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or\nfailures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting\nother external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to\nprotect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard\nconfidential information, including restricting the access of customers\nto their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and\nconfidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among\nfinancial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payments processors,\nfinancial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing\nhouses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk\nthat the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or\nentity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide\noperational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nability to conduct business.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations rely on its ability,\nand the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-\nstaffed workforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness,\nhealth and safety of employees.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and\nprofitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of\nits clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its\noperations appropriately and on the competence, integrity, health and\nsafety of its employees.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5010, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fdd4080-1582-4774-a055-12d19d09a7c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fdd4080-1582-4774-a055-12d19d09a7c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5793aba1-cfc3-4f7e-b737-a7082b683e33", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a9e521852ba1f0dd5229512ad3903b26145c2e4a03f31a35babc145c2ea45b61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4af0493f-2ad3-46cf-8f2c-fbb576eecc6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "de9d09ce34768f3d64a31ac5b8ed5c3032a7143f503d515a53f61f97aab606d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca96bf7b-1eee-4092-9927-8793f521606f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ab8152f51854e20d01b2b0cad4dd54d2bdd6d2e3463871b957ae7c4ed2ace71", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "11bbbd2bd66e2db4e93c5166168d61c417a09b8062d626c59bb765d8a86b40de", "text": "JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations rely on its ability,\nand the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-\nstaffed workforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness,\nhealth and safety of employees.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and\nprofitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of\nits clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its\noperations appropriately and on the competence, integrity, health and\nsafety of its employees.

For\nexample, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on\nassumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various\nasset classes or other market indicators.

JPMorgan Chase also uses internal\nmodels and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in\nconnection with the preparation of its financial statements under U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\nThese models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions\nand historical trends, and are periodicallyreviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations\nthat JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to\nidentify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:\n\u2022reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future,\nincluding assumptions underlying the models and estimations\nsuch as correlations among certain market indicators or asset\nprices\n\u2022inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain\neconomic and financial outcomes\n\u2022historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be\nindicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme\nvolatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity\n\u2022sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans\nand securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial\ninstruments\n\u2022technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may\nnot perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the\npersonnel using the technology\n\u2022models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations,\nformulas or algorithms, and\n\u2022review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and\nestimations.\nJPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if models,\nestimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk\nmanagement activities or the preparation of its financial statements\nprove to have been inadequate or incorrect.

For example,\naggressive or less disciplined lending practices by nonbank\ncompetitors could lead to a loss of market share for traditional banks,\nand in an economic downturn could result in instability in the financial\nservices industry and adversely impact other market participants,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge.\nFor example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce\nhave made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products\nand services that traditionally were banking products. These\nadvances have also allowed financial institutions and other\ncompanies to provide electronic and internet-based financial\nsolutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading,\nlending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments\nprocessing and online automated algorithmic-based investment\nadvice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking\ncompetitors face the risk that payments processing and other\nproducts and services, including deposits and other traditional\nbanking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new\ntechnologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using\nsecure distributed ledgers, that require no intermediation. New\ntechnologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to\nspend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients\nand customers or to match products and services offered by its\ncompetitors, including technology companies. In addition, new\ntechnologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by\nthird parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that\napply to the offering of products and services through those\ntechnologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns\nfrom providing products and services through those technologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and services or may cause JPMorgan\nChase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional\nbanking products. This competition may be on the basis of quality and\nvariety of products and services offered, transaction execution,\ninnovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and\ncustomers, whether due to general market conditions, under-\nperformance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service,\nchanges in client and customer expectations or other factors, could\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract or retain clients and\ncustomers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nrevenues. Increased competition alsomay require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments\nin its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its\nclients in order to remain competitive.\nThe effects of climate change could adversely affect JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s business and operations, both directly and as a result of\nimpacts on its clients and customers.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and\ncommunities around the world where its business, and the activities of\nits clients and customers, could be adversely affected by climate\nchange. Climate change could manifest as a financial risk to\nJPMorgan Chase either through changes in the physical climate or\nfrom the process of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Both\nphysical risks and transition risks associated with climate change\ncould have negative impacts on the financial condition or\ncreditworthiness of JPMorgan\u2019s clients and customers, and on its\nexposure to those clients and customers.\nClimate-related physical risks include the increased frequency or\nseverity of acute weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical\nstorms, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as persistent changes\nin precipitation levels, rising sea levels, or increases in average\nambient temperature.Potential adverse impacts of climate-related\nphysical risks include:\n\u2022declines in asset values, including due to the destruction or\ndegradation of property\n\u2022reduced availability or increased cost of insurance for clients of\nJPMorgan Chase\n\u2022interruptions to business operations, including supply chain\ndisruption, and\n\u2022population migration or unemployment in affected regions.\nTransition risks arise from societal adjustment to a lower-carbon\neconomy, such as changes in public policy, adoption of new\ntechnologies or changes in consumer preferences towards low-\ncarbon goods and services.

In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s exposure\nto legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in\nsome cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase\nhas established for those matters.\n32", "start_char_idx": 3830, "end_char_idx": 5427, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "164918a8-8d86-43bd-b60d-518c569dd1ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "164918a8-8d86-43bd-b60d-518c569dd1ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2f2dde8-29d2-4817-b891-b5f93ee82669", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9309b3bbe480103ada21f376309cf321897e0682bb183f790a4f967b01fc0a6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf14cf0c-08f1-4b92-a065-59d0c7d927bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b4969f2d5f47773916098e8de8b7ac599c9a288c2653a7473ebd09f02a73fe9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f2118ff-6d52-47d2-afcb-3a5b654ccf01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e32cf6f76655cdc2720d8d01ef4bb81d0b5af57280243a66d58c8babe0212b08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1062882b80d80362ae3f7111bfcfebda7e2b04eb5dad4db4802072b3bb07f494", "text": "Item 1B.

The Firm has taken and continues to take steps to close\npositions and reduce certain of its business activities and exposures\nconnected with the war, and to assist clients with fulfilling any pre-\nexisting obligations and managing their Russia-related risks.\nThe Firm\u2019s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients and\ncounterparties is not material to its financial condition or results of\noperations. However, the Firm continues to monitor potential\nsecondary impacts of the war, including increased market volatility,\ninflationary pressures and the effects of financial and economic\nsanctions imposed by various governments, that could have adverse\neffects on the Firm\u2019s businesses.\nThe Firm also continues to monitor and manage the operational risks\nassociated with the war, including compliance with the financial and\neconomic sanctions and the increased risk of cyber attacks.\nRefer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126, Allowance for\nCredit Losses on pages 127-129, Market Risk Management on pages\n131-138, Country Risk Management on pages 139-140 and\nOperational Risk Management on pages 142-144 for additional\ninformation.\nFor purposes of this Form 10-K, \u201cRussia\u201d refers to exposure to clients\nand counterparties of the Firm for which the largest proportion of their\nassets is located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is derived,\nin Russia, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country risk management\nframework; and \u201cRussia-associated\u201d refers to exposure to clients and\ncounterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic or financial\nsanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been imposed or which\nhave close association with Russia.Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cIBOR\u201d) transition\nThe Firm and other market participants are preparing for the final\nstages of the transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered\nRate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other IBORs in accordance with the International\nOrganization of Securities Commission\u2019s standards for transaction-\nbased benchmark rates. The cessation of the publication of the\nremaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-\nmonth, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) (\u201cLIBOR\nCessation\u201d) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly reduced the\nnotional amount of its exposure to contracts that reference U.S. dollar\nLIBOR, including in derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans,\nsecurities, and debt and preferred stock issuances, and is on-track to\nmeet both its internal milestones for contract remediation as well as the\nindustry milestones and recommendations published by National\nWorking Groups, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee\nin the U.S. The Firm also continues to engage with clients to assist\nthem with transitioning their U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts to\nreplacement rates in anticipation of LIBOR Cessation. The majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s remaining LIBOR exposure is to derivative contracts. The\nFirm will be participating in initiatives by the principal central\ncounterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d) to convert cleared derivatives contracts linked\nto U.S. dollar LIBOR in the second quarter of 2023 which will\nremediate approximately 40% of the Firm\u2019s remaining U.S. dollar\nLIBOR derivatives exposure. The Firm expects that the majority of the\nremaining derivatives exposure will be remediated predominantly\nthrough contractual fallback provisions.\nOn March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (\u201cLIBOR\nAct\u201d) was signed into law in the U.S. The LIBOR Act provides a\nframework for replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR as the reference rate in\nlegacy financial contracts that may not otherwise transition to a\nreplacement rate upon LIBOR Cessation.

That presentation, which is referred to as \u201creported\u201d\nbasis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm\u2019s results\nthat can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a\ncomparison of the Firm\u2019s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial\nstatements of other companies.\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm\u2019s results on a reported basis,\nmanagement reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio,\non a \u201cmanaged\u201d basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are\nnon-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of\nthe LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed\nbasis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and\nincludes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the\nFirm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE\nbasis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits\nand tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a\nbasis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These\nfinancial measures allowmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-\nyear arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The\ncorresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is\nrecorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no\nimpact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the\nLOBs.\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the\nFirm and business-segment level because these other non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provide information to investors about the\nunderlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the\nparticular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore\nfacilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the\nperformance of its relevant competitors.

The management\nreporting process that derives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an\nannual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future\nperiods. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also provide various business metrics\nwhich are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in\nassessing performance.\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to\nthe Firm\u2019s clients and customers, the participating business segments\nmay agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is\ngenerally recognized in the segment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in\nthe transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\nExpense Allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by corporate\nsupport units, or another business segment, the costs of those\nservices are allocated to the respective business segments. The\nexpense is generallyallocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In\ncontrast, certain costs and investments related to corporate support\nunits, technology and operations that are not currently utilized by any\nLOB, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in\nCorporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs\nthat would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone\nbusinesses, and other items not aligned with a particular business\nsegment.\nFunds transfer pricing\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by which the Firm\nallocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other\nCorporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk\nto Treasury and CIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance\nsheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions\nutilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions\nand other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest\nincome to the segments.\nAs a result of the rising interest rate environment, the cost of funds for\nassets and the credits earned for liabilities have generally increased,\nimpacting the business segments\u2019 net interest income. During the\nperiod ended December 31, 2022, this has resulted in higher cost of\nfunds for loans and contributed to margin expansion on deposits.(a)(b)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 61", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4417, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "881f0881-2d94-447c-a4e7-8c89c9621b91": {"__data__": {"id_": "881f0881-2d94-447c-a4e7-8c89c9621b91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0170245d-a8ae-4c1c-810a-ad91a2ddac6b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6175f1f8f4db1a8527962f93f9e89e55a04c55319877a3c1fe9fd9f583321cbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a3d35ab-ec05-4c75-a07b-d850d8a8816f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "06b62ff5c1eba0ad91fe42443f6dde23c49e0c6359a4637fd4ca2c8681c05fc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "63e4a213-39b0-49eb-a448-c2c5e0f342c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8ce40e05fd694512063451581432e4fbf78256ad5181923994e8ac22c2477a29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "55cf4a27289f4001ec593e947d496f865840a99885d2a1b75726e5a18d6da413", "text": "Management\u2019 s discussion and analysis\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other\nCorporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses.\nTreasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the\nimpact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred\nrisk in its results.

reflecting higher amortization related to new\naccount origination costs partially offset by higher annual fees in\nCard Services, while net interchange income was relatively flat,\npartially offset by\n\u2022higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting the absence of a\nnet loss in MSR risk management in the prior year primarily driven\nby updates to model inputs related to prepayment

Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets\nand Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal\ntransactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net\ninterest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance\non a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line\nitems. For example, securities that generate net interest income may\nbe risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a\ndescription of the composition of these income statement line items.\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and\ncommodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making\nactivity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized\nupon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as\n\u201cinventory-related revenue\u201d, which is revenue recognized from gains\nand losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has\nbeen holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client demand, and\nchanges in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively\nmanage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal\ntransactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions\nwith market participants is affected by many factors including the level\nof client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is thedifference between the price at which a market participant is willing\nand able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which\nanother market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm,\nand vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are\ninterrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-\nrelated revenue, which include general market conditions, such as\ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and\ncommodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions. \n (a)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n70 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3566, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a610479c-f0d3-43cb-b61f-1b88b2f27d4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a610479c-f0d3-43cb-b61f-1b88b2f27d4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d302f824-c71c-4418-85d6-3efb3d454baa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "fce7a23a87216a1faf097c019628c9c8cf4b0d75da9778b103d8440ccbef2cef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "530e65fb-0611-4006-9c90-f6b4458bc9c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3df2692ccbe050bb7879187c04976495b5d73e3fa29b4e0377820d0fd3bfb3be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "42c07ed3-21af-461b-b7fd-7213ee76a1e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50224312d96f7bd70420e59e0d0c1e900fc49b9e7b7e34db57baf9e42064aee4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "524b41fec6f8d90be949d4486a9bdb295e6c6825c997815db1ac753462609845", "text": "For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new\ntransactions.\n2022 2021 2020\nYear ended December 31, \n (in millions, except where otherwise\nnoted)Fixed Income\nMarketsEquity\nMarkets Total MarketsFixed Income\nMarketsEquity\nMarkets Total MarketsFixed Income\nMarketsEquity\nMarkets Total Markets\nPrincipal transactions $ 11,682 $ 8,846 $ 20,528 $ 7,911 $ 7,519 $ 15,430 $ 11,857 $ 6,087 $ 17,944 \nLending- and deposit-related fees 303 22 325 321 17 338 226 10 236 \nAsset management, administration and\ncommissions 550 2,007 2,557 545 1,967 2,512 411 2,087 2,498 \nAll other income 916 (131) 785 972 (101) 871 493 (62) 431 \nNoninterest revenue 13,451 10,744 24,195 9,749 9,402 19,151 12,987 8,122 21,109 \nNet interest income 5,166 (377) 4,789 7,116 1,127 8,243 7,891 483 8,374 \nTotal net revenue $ 18,617 $ 10,367 $ 28,984 $ 16,865 $ 10,529 $ 27,394 $ 20,878 $ 8,605 $ 29,483 \nLoss days 7 4 4\n(a)Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue.

A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of\nindustry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-\nwide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom\n10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a\nweighted average of the performance associated with a fund\u2019s three-, five and ten-\nyear (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate\nstar ratings are provided at the individual share\nclass level. The Nomura \u201cstar rating\u201d is based on three-year risk-adjusted\nperformance only.

All ratings, the assigned peer categories and\nthe asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund\nrating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset\nvalues into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the\nshare class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a \u201cprimary share class\u201d level to\nrepresent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura\nprovides ratings at the fund level.

The Firm\u2019s overall objective is to manage its\nbusiness, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving\nthe interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the\nsafety and soundness of the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among\nother things:\n\u2022Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation\nof risks by all individuals within the Firm;\n\u2022Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and\nmanagement within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and\n\u2022A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework\nwith strong internal governance and independent oversight by the\nBoard of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk and control issues\nis carefully considered in the Firm\u2019s performance evaluation and\nincentive compensation processes.\nRisk governance framework\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework involves understanding drivers\nof risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. \nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks\ninclude, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory\nor government policy, competitor or market evolution, business\ndecisions, process or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing,\ndysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves. The\nFirm\u2019s risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:\n\u2022Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation\nassociated with poorly designed or failed business plans or\ninadequate responses to changes in the operating environment.\n\u2022Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or\nchange in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or\nloss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments,\nincludingconsumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio\nrisk.\n\u2022Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in\nmarket factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity\nand commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the\nvalue of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.\n\u2022Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors;\nor external events impacting the Firm\u2019s processes or systems.\nOperational risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk.\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and\nqualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting,\nincluding quantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings and\ncapital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts\nsuch as damage to the Firm\u2019s reputation, loss of clients and\ncustomers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework is managed on a Firmwide\nbasis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d)\nfunction, which is comprised of Risk Management and Compliance.\nThe Firm\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) appoints, subject to\napproval by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\nRisk Committee\u201d), the Firm\u2019s Chief Risk Officer (\u201cCRO\u201d) to lead the\nIRM function and maintain the risk governance framework of the Firm.\nThe framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee\nthrough its review and approval of the Risk Governance and\nOversight Policy.\nThe Firm\u2019s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the Firmwide\nRisk Executives (\u201cFREs\u201d), the Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and\nCorporate (\u201cLOB CROs\u201d), and the Firm\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer\n(\u201cCCO\u201d), who, in turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance\norganizations, develop the Firm\u2019s risk governance policies and\nstandards, and define and oversee the implementation of the Firm\u2019s\nrisk governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise\nin their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks that span\nacross the LOBs and Corporate, functions and regions.

The Firm\u2019s Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and\napproving the capital planning framework.\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative economic\nand business scenarios on the Firm\u2019s earnings and capital. Economic\nscenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are\ndefined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These\nscenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which\nare key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which\ngenerate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic\noperational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and\nstress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In\naddition to CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management also\nconsiders tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as\nnecessary.\nContingency Capital Plan\nThe Firm\u2019s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital\nmanagement framework for the Firm and specifies the principles\nunderlying the Firm\u2019s approach towards capital management in\nnormal economic conditions and in stressed environments. The\nContingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted\ncapital levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the\nongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out\nthe capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or\nconsidered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of\nstress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-\ncapitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company.\nThe OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm\u2019s IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital\nAccord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.Basel III Overview\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and\noverall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active\nU.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined\nby calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and off-\nbalance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a\nstandardized approach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d), and an advanced\napproach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based capital\nratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their\nrespective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm\u2019s Basel III\nStandardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the\nBasel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\nBasel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk\nRWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced,\noperational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk\nRWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that\nfor Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive\napproaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and\nparameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is\ngenerally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily\nby counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated\non a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and\nBasel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these\napproaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate\nmanagement judgment and feedback from its regulators.\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches\nbanking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR.

As of December 31, 2022, the\nU.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal\nReserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer\ncan be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine\nthat systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be\ncalibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month\nimplementation period.\nFailure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-\nbased regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer\n(inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will\nresult in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may\ndistribute, such as through dividends and common share\nrepurchases, as well as certain executive discretionary bonus\npayments.\nRisk-based Capital Targets\nThe Firm\u2019s current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital\nratio is 13.0% for the first quarter of 2023, increasing to 13.5% for the\nfirst quarter of 2024 with consideration for an increase in the GSIB\nsurcharge in 2024, and assuming no change in the Stress Capital\nBuffer. The Firm\u2019s quarterly capital ratios may vary from these targets\ndependent on market conditions. These targets are based on the\nBasel III capital rules currently in effect.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier\nholding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of\nexternal TLAC and eligible long-term debt (\u201celigible LTD\u201d). Refer to\nTLAC on page 95 for additional information.Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\nSupplementary leverage ratio\nBanking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are\ncurrently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking\norganizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an\nadditional 2.0% leverage buffer.\nThe SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the\nFirm\u2019s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated\nby taking the Firm\u2019s total average on-balance sheet assets, less\namounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding\ncertain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments\nand derivatives potential future exposure.\nFailure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory\nrequirement will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the\nFirm may distribute such as through dividends and common share\nrepurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary bonus\npayments.\nOther regulatory capital\nIn addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the\nFirm and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and\nleverage ratios in order to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the regulations\nissued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action\n(\u201cPCA\u201d) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d),\nrespectively.

The\nnature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends\non numerous contractual and behavioral factors,\nwhich the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress\ntesting metrics. The Firm believes that itmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in\nfunding capacity due to ratings downgrades.\nAdditionally, the Firm\u2019s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-\nparty commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit\nratings.

The Firm provides credit\nto a variety of clients and customers, ranging from large corporate\nand institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses.\nIn its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk\nprimarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business\nbanking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed\nto credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and\nhedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as\nthrough its operating services activities (such as cash management\nand clearing activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is\nalso exposed to credit risk through its investment securities portfolio\nand cash placed with banks.\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit risk\nthroughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures.\nThe Firm\u2019s credit risk management governance includes the following\nactivities:\n\u2022Maintaining a credit risk policy framework\n\u2022Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio\nsegments, including transaction and exposure approval\n\u2022Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as\nappropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines\n\u2022Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the\napproval of credit exposure\n\u2022Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and\n\u2022Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit risk-\nbased capital managementRisk identification and measurement\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for\nestimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default.\nMethodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several\nfactors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale),\nrisk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and\nborrower\u2019s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk\nmanagement and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center\nversus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement\nis based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the\nloss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and estimates described\nin Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses for its\nexposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit\nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment\nloan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments reflects\nestimated credit losses related to the Firm\u2019s lending-related\ncommitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects\nestimated credit losses related to the investment securities\nportfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates\nused by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information.\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the\nallocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of\nactual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses\nand lending-related commitments. The analyses for these losses\ninclude stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios\nas described below.\nStress testing\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in\nthe Firm\u2019s credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses the\npotential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on\nestimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the\nunderlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of\nmacroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The\nstress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in\ndelinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In\naddition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also\nconsiders additional stresses outside these scenarios, including\nindustry and country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The\nFirm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite\nboth at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of\nstress on individual counterparties.\n106 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4664, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "018f5ccf-db29-4966-8d2a-d46f7d5a94c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "018f5ccf-db29-4966-8d2a-d46f7d5a94c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7407a42e-a3e3-483f-9dd2-6525b76c8082", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f0ec2210d4bf3710f86ff6bef3395c41f9c98703dbc54650a340005438aa1fa1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7933a04e-5d74-4fba-a5d1-98b2d2c68a98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d741129de87c4690e70cd8d58234952ea572cf28cb8cc5a114b2eca1b3004238", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "31869bc7-b1df-45eb-8b33-3d6ec4729a29", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a2830a2a47fad4fbf5e6830f63124ef4da5d0237ce5a88d4cc70e63a66715cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5546e9cd45367dab71adda58580839fb1a17463361bd938dd8f0b2c08338303f", "text": "Risk monitoring and management\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to\npreserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-\nmaking process for extending credit so that credit risks are assessed\naccurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed\nactively at both the transaction and portfolio levels.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The\nFirm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates\ninto the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage\nportfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is\nactively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of\nclient credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral\nwhere applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.\nRefer to the industry discussion on pages 118-121 for further\ninformation.\nThe Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB,\nCB, AWM, and Corporate, as well as the risk-rated BWM and auto\ndealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is\napplied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\nIn 2022, wholesale credit continued to perform well with charge-offs\nremaining low.\nAs of December 31, 2022, retained loans increased by $43.3 billion\ndriven by CIB and CB, including higher revolver utilization, partially\noffset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased\n$14.5 billion, driven by net portfolio activity in CIB, including a\ndecrease in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio,\nlargely offset by net portfolio activity in AWM and CB.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the investment-grade percentage of the\nportfolio remained relatively flat at 70%, while criticized exposure\ndecreased by $6.9 billion from $38.2 billion to $31.3 billion. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, nonperforming exposure decreased by $406.0\nmillion driven by a decline in lending-related commitments in CIB and\nloans in AWM as a result of client-specific upgrades, paydowns and\ncancelled commitments, largely offset by client-specific downgrades\nin CIB including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-associated\nclients in the first quarter of 2022.

The contractual amounts of\nthese financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk\nshould the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm\nfulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon\nor a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the\ntotal contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related\ncommitments is representative of the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further\ninformation on wholesale lending-related commitments.\nReceivables from customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans\nto brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by\nassets maintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on\ndeposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities).\nBecause of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk, the\nFirm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit\nadditional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest\nand accounts receivable on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk,\nincluding credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm\nmakes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses\nderivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk\npositions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market\nrisk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is\nexposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of\nthe derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (\u201cETD\u201d),\nsuch as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (\u201cOTC-\ncleared\u201d) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of\nthe relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit\nrisk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of\nlegally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral\nagreements. The percentage of the Firm\u2019s OTC derivative\ntransactions subject to collateral agreements \u2014 excluding foreign\nexchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral\nagreements due to their shortmaturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily \u2014 was\napproximately 87% and 88% at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm\u2019s\nuse of collateral agreements and further discussion of derivative\ncontracts, counterparties and settlement types.\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets were $70.9 billion and $57.1 billion at December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by\nhigher foreign exchange as a result of market movements. Derivative\nreceivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after\ngiving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the\nrelated cash collateral held by the Firm.\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral\nthat may be used as security when the fair value of the client\u2019s\nexposure is in the Firm\u2019s favor. For these purposes, the definition of\nliquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid\nassets as defined in the LCR rule.\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk\nshould also take into consideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets\nunder the LCR rule.

To capture the potential future\nvariability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client\nbasis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss:\nPeak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (\u201cDRE\u201d), and Average exposure\n(\u201cAVG\u201d). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral\nbenefits, where applicable.\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative\nexposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty\ncalculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5%\nconfidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary\nmeasure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative\ncontracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure\nmanagement.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative\nexposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to be\nequivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for\naggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other\ncredit risk.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm\u2019s\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, at future time\nperiods. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is used as\nthe primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit\nrisk capital and CVA, as further described below.\nThe fair value of the Firm\u2019s derivative receivables incorporates CVA to\nreflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm\u2019s\nAVG to a counterparty and the counterparty\u2019s credit spread in the\ncredit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk\nmanagement is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the\nderivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm\u2019s riskmanagement process for derivatives exposures takes into\nconsideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly\ndefined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively\ncorrelated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty,\nwhich could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the\ncounterparty\u2019s capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many\nfactors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations\nover time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm\nmay adjust the CVA associated with a particular counterparty\u2019s AVG.\nThe Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into\ncredit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange,\nequity and commodity derivative contracts.\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm\u2019s current\nderivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak,\nDRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that\nexposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to\nthe portfolio.\nExposure profile of derivatives measures\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in billions)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 125", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3495, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "629f8f9e-91a0-4135-acd1-fa09f18fd6b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "629f8f9e-91a0-4135-acd1-fa09f18fd6b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fab486b8-c8ea-4e55-b3f2-a92177d87230", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "77229be520ca2f9087d0e415ea1c6619ef2fbf5615ba31564f2618b17293874f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "16af4b85-36d9-4b5f-968d-f75a9063c4d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f96292fc9ce08ce4b1169fd400d4e6eed35a5b9b914beb41671d29491a607231", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb5efdda-243e-4eb1-98dd-ea7100ceeec5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "06921cbf9614c34871773e2f5fd22b854a9e1467d0b5b6e3321b4d0edb228cb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "aee1a4cc93ea741081a9e1a2647e0b7ae3d00ef9a1b83675a60be37ff959bbe5", "text": "Management\u2019 s discussion and analysis\nCredit derivatives\nThe Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its\ncapacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user to manage\nthe Firm\u2019s own credit risk associated with various exposures.\nCredit portfolio management activities\nIncluded in the Firm\u2019s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to\nmitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities\n(loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty\nexposure in the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses (collectively, \u201ccredit\nportfolio management activities\u201d).

The\ninvestment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and\nCIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability\nmanagement objectives. Principal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and\nCorporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over\nextended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for\nshort-term realized gains with respect to these investments.\nInvestment securities risk\nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a\ndefault in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated\ngiven that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and\nCIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At\nDecember 31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $629.3 billion, and\nthe average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was\nAA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to\nCorporate segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for further\ninformation on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for\nfurther information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk\nManagement on pages 131-138 for further information on the market\nrisk inherent in the portfolio.\nGovernance and oversight\nInvestment securities risks are governed by the Firm\u2019s Risk Appetite\nframework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with regular\nupdates provided to the Board Risk Committee.\nThe Firm\u2019s independent control functions are responsible for\nreviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment\nsecurities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for\ninvestment securities are established for each risk category, including\ncapital and credit risks.Principal investment risk\nPrincipal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In\ngeneral, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and\ninvestments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's\nbalance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing\nbusinesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm\u2019s\nprincipal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and\nare reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm\u2019s\ninvestments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including\nthe Firm\u2019s commitment to support underserved communities and\nminority-owned businesses.\nThe table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the\nprincipal investment portfolios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(in billions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nTax-oriented investments, primarily in\nalternative energy and affordable\nhousing $ 26.2 $ 23.2 \nPrivate equity, various debt and equity\ninstruments, and real assets 10.8 7.3 \nTotal carrying value $ 37.0 $ 30.5 \n(a)Includes the Firm\u2019s 40% ownership in C6 Bank and 49% ownership in Viva Wallet.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm\u2019s approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the\nFirm\u2019s risk governance structure.

"Value-at-risk\nJPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d), a statistical risk\nmeasure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in\nthe current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR\nframework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using historical\nsimulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The\nframework\u2019s approach assumes that historical changes in market\nvalues are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in\nthe immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management\nVaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along\nwith other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information\nneeded to respond to risk events.\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day\nholding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which\napproximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR\nprovides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of\ndiversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks\nand monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported to\nsenior management, the Board of Directors and regulators.\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR\nmodels that simulate historical market returns for individual risk\nfactors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part\nof the Firm\u2019s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model\ncalculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give\nrise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate\nnumerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market\nvalues over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk\nprofile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used\nto generate daily market values may be different across product types\nor risk management systems. The VaR model results across all\nportfolios are aggregated at the Firm level.\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of\nmarket risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based\non their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons,\nand other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability\nto measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those\nassociated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in\nmarket conditions.\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR\ndue to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical\ndata. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other\nproducts when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using\nan actual price-based time series for these products, if available,\nwould affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers\nother nonstatistical measures such as stresstesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk\npositions.\nThe daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the\nindependent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its\nmonthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market\nprices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical\ntime series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in\nNote 2 for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process. As VaR\nmodel calculations require daily data and a consistent source for\nvaluation, it may not be practical to use the data collected in the VCG\nmonthly valuation process for VaR model calculations.\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and\nenhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm\u2019s\nportfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such\nchanges may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to\nEstimations and Model Risk Management on page 148 for information\nregarding model reviews and approvals.\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance\nwith regulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is used to derive the\nFirm\u2019s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III\ncapital rules.

The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now\nreflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n(c)In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR.\n(d)The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.\n(e)The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components, and consequently, diversification benefit is not meaningful.\nAverage Total VaR increased by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared with the prior year.

The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude\ncertain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and\nintraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total\nnet revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent\nwith the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk\nManagement VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the\nFirm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average.

Stress testing measures the Firm\u2019s\nvulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible\neconomic and market scenarios. The results are used to understand\nthe exposures responsible for those potential losses and are\nmeasured against limits.\nThe Firm\u2019s stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in\nthe LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used to calculate multiple\nmagnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-\noffs, assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit\nspreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity\nprices, and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of\nhypothetical economic and market scenarios.\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in\nspecific asset classes and geographies, including how the event may\nimpact multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also\nincorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between\ndifferent products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the\nFirm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against\npossible future stress events. Stress testing results are reported\nperiodically to senior management of the Firm, as appropriate.\nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework, under\nthe oversight of Market Risk Management, and the models to\ncalculate the stress results are subject to the Firm\u2019s Estimations and\nModel Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress\nMethodology Committee reviews and approves changes to stress\ntesting methodology and scenarios across the Firm. Significant\nchanges to the framework are escalated to senior management, as\nappropriate.\nThe Firm\u2019s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the Firm\u2019s\nCCAR and other stress test results, which are reported periodically to\nthe Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are\nincorporated into the Firm\u2019s Risk Appetite framework, and are\nreported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above\ncertain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline\nin revenue from its year-to-date peak level.\nEarnings-at-risk\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm\u2019s reported net income\nis important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm\u2019s\nsignificant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from theFirm\u2019s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans\nand credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 132 for a summary by\nLOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm\u2019s structural interest\nrate risk policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the\nBoard Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with\nthe LOBs, calculates the Firm\u2019s structural interest rate risk profile and\nreviews it with senior management, including the CTC Risk\nCommittee.

Acute physical risk drivers include the\nincreased frequency or severity of climate and weather events, such\nas floods, wildfires and tropical storms. Chronic physical risk drivers\ninclude more gradual shifts in the climate, such as rising sea levels,\npersistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in average\nambient temperatures.\nTransition risk refers to the financial and economic implications\nassociated with a societal adjustment to a low-carbon economy.\nTransition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy,\nadoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences.\nTransition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical\nclimate.\nOrganization and management\nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is responsible\nfor establishing the Firmwide framework and strategy for managing\nclimate risk.

Operational risk is inherent in the Firm\u2019s activities and\ncan manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business\ndisruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond\nthe Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behavior,\nfailure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure\nof vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with\ntheir agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage\noperational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm\u2019s financial\nposition, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and\nregulatory environments in which it operates.\nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe Firm\u2019s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk (\u201cCCOR\u201d)\nManagement Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern,\nidentify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm\u2019s\noperational risk.\nOperational Risk Governance\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of\noperational risk. The Control Management Organization, which\nconsists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is\nresponsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.\nThe Firm\u2019s Global Chief Compliance Officer (\u201cCCO\u201d) and FRE for\nOperational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is responsible for\ndefining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the\nminimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned\nCCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for\nOperational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent\nof the respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR\nManagement Framework is included in the Risk Governance and\nOversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk\nCommittee periodically.\nOperational Risk Identification\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-assessment\nprocess that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this\nprocess, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their\nrespective control environment to assess where controls have failed,\nand to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The\nFirm\u2019s Operational Risk and Compliance organization (\u201cOperational\nRisk and Compliance\u201d) provides oversight of and challenge to these\nevaluations and may also perform independent assessments of\nsignificant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or\nemerging risk.Operational Risk Measurement\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an independent\nassessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and\nCorporate, which includes evaluating the effectiveness of the control\nenvironments and reporting the results to senior management.\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational\nrisks through quantitative means, including operational risk-based\ncapital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline\nand stressed conditions.\nThe primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the\nLoss Distribution Approach (\u201cLDA\u201d) statistical model, which simulates\nthe frequency and severity of future operational risk loss projections\nbased on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an\naggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a\n99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal\noperational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which\nthose losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to\nreflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving\nrise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm\u2019s\noperational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the Advanced\nMeasurement Approach (\u201cAMA\u201d), incorporates internal and external\nlosses as well as management\u2019s view of tail risk captured through\noperational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business\nenvironment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect\nthe impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on\noperational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of\nmaterial operational risk events that may occur in a stressed\nenvironment. The Firm\u2019s operational risk stress testing framework is\nutilized in calculating results for the Firm\u2019s CCAR and other stress\ntesting processes.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for information\nrelated to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing\nThe results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and\nCompliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring\nand testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules\nand regulations.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5129, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d2da105-405a-44cc-b121-64c45a9cd593": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d2da105-405a-44cc-b121-64c45a9cd593", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4bd4ac0-2955-48b5-933d-f7b70c021124", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "364d8387c33c676413e6a21f6909c898711ccb3d9cd941742a02d72d97368c67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "76f4ca6f-b8f3-49a6-8c05-54e737949dae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ef0c3b2d349808218e90486e4ffd64c8c0bf48b946c4bae789def88af8b254a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "98f7199d-9876-4794-a824-e5381da86562", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "611e0c16eceac01ac0ab1e85150c0ac1ea66b0eb157e2697a931cee9a706be1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1d2c7f02d1af54ac92206f8b06bb70246508615a19232887686858d9f00f480a", "text": "The Firm does not reflect\nthe impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on\noperational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of\nmaterial operational risk events that may occur in a stressed\nenvironment.

Risks identified by Operational Risk and Compliance\nare escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control\nCommittees, as needed. Operational Risk and Compliance has\nestablished standards designed to ensure that consistent operational\nrisk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide\nbasis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the\nevaluation of key risk and performance indicators against established\nthresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational\nrisk against stated risk appetite. The standards reinforce escalation\nprotocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors.\nSubcategories and examples of operational risks\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways.

These sanctions\nare complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face\nincreased operational risk associated with addressing these complex\ncompliance-related matters. To manage this increased risk, the Firm\nhas implemented controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of\nnon-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in\nproperty subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments\nas required by the applicable regulations.\nCybersecurity risk\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm\u2019s exposure to harm or loss\nresulting from misuse or abuse of technology by malicious actors.\nCybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus for\nthe Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and\nenhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks,\nstorage devices, and other technology assets. The Firm\u2019s security\nefforts are designed to protect against, among other things,\ncybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain\naccess to confidential information, destroy data,disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.\nThe Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue to\nexperience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against\nthe backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has\nimplemented precautionary measures and controls reasonably\ndesigned to address this increased risk, such as enhanced threat\nmonitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures taken by\nthe Firm will be successful in defending against cyber attacks.\nOngoing business expansions may expose the Firm to potential new\nthreats as well as expanded regulatory scrutiny including the\nintroduction of new cybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues to\nmake significant investments in enhancing its cyber defense\ncapabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate\ngovernment and law enforcement agencies and other businesses in\norder to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the\noperating environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency\nagainst cybersecurity threats. The Firm actively participates in\ndiscussions and simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and\nwith law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry groups,\nand has significantly increased efforts to educate employees and\ncertain clients on the topic of cybersecurity risks.\nThird parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the\nFirm\u2019s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain, exchanges,\nclearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) are\nalso sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm.

The estimation\nmethods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many\npurposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk,\nassessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing,\nevaluating the allowance for credit losses and making business\ndecisions. A dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance\nand Review (\u201cMRGR\u201d), defines and governs the Firm\u2019s policies\nrelating to the management of model risk and risks associated with\ncertain analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those\nused in risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning\nand analysis.\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within\nMRGR\u2019s scope follows a consistent approach which is used for\nmodels, as described in detail below.\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm\nbased on the specific purposes of such models. Users and\ndevelopers of models are responsible for developing, implementing\nand testing their models, as well as referring models to MRGR for\nreview and approval. Once models have been approved, model users\nand developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating\nenvironment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the\nmodels on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek\nto enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in\nproduct and market developments, as well as to capture\nimprovements in available modeling techniques and systems\ncapabilities.Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their\ncomplexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm\u2019s\nreliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of\nMRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR considers whether the model\nis suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used. When\nreviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the model\nmethodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and\nmay perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of\nmodel outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate\nlevel of management within MRGR based on the relevant model tier.\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy,\nMRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material\nchanges to existing models, prior to their use. In certain\ncircumstances, exceptions may be granted to the Firm\u2019s policy to\nallow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also\nrequire the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk\nif it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the\nmodel and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or\nuncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic\nenvironment. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted\nenvironments are significantly different from the historical\nenvironments upon which the models were developed, as the Firm\nexperienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This\nincreased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment\nand analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to\nmodel outputs than would otherwise be the case.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages\n149-152 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and\nother valuation techniques.\n \n148 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3797, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4eac257a-cd8a-4432-9b35-17929df2a576": {"__data__": {"id_": "4eac257a-cd8a-4432-9b35-17929df2a576", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c2fa2ac9-fdb0-4e56-8a8c-005e9c9d648d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "345980923c78b0adea151c7a00792193019c160a2dc7478edd5cd28152a34002", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3495d3e5-87d9-4b9a-98ef-4fe755a00bd6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "150", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "dfeb2fcf0730c1126f903ace071a9c1a77e3896f8ba25a2becd32f633e0d79f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a7fa3415-277e-4f6f-9862-52216dc49aee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "57c1d45c979274583da7ab4686789eef36fc34a7e52e923790d2f204c0473a8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "32f839e84affa617e795e63885b3601b8d4a8bbf006688f85dc088018cf6a785", "text": "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES USED BY THE FIRM\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies and use of estimates are\nintegral to understanding its reported results. The Firm\u2019s most\ncomplex accounting estimates require management\u2019s judgment to\nascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The\nFirm has established policies and control procedures intended to\nensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as\npart of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and\napplied consistently from period to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets\nor liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies,\nwhich may vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios. In\naddition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the\nprocess for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner.\nThe Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of\nits assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s critical accounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents management\u2019s\nestimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of\nthe Firm\u2019s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain\noff-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for\ncredit losses comprises:\n\u2022The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained\nloan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\u2022The allowance for lending-related commitments, and\n\u2022The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development and weighting of\nmacroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience,\nassessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings,\nvaluation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on these\njudgments as well as the Firm\u2019s policies and methodologies used to\ndetermine the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic\nforecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (\u201cMEVs\u201d)\nthat are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty\nvariables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the\nmodeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\n\u2022Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S.\nunemployment rates, HPI and U.S. real GDP.\u2022Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, corporate\ncredit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of economic\nconditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit\nlosses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant\nchanges in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or\ninput might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and\ninputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be\nconsistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in\nfactors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that\nimprovement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic\nforecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined\nusing its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios,\nwhich are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments.

Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The\ntype and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the\namount of observable market information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed valuation models and\nother valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs\nand are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy,\njudgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those\nrequired when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within\nlevels 1 and 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the appropriate valuation model or\nother valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of\ncertain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant\nempirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed,\ndefault rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity,\nequity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign\nexchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including\nunobservable inputs used.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment\nmust be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation\nadjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations,\nunobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified\ncriteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual\nterms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as\na whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty\njudgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable\nvaluation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer\nto Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by\nthe Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors\ncan affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are\nappropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the\nmethods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the\ndetermination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions\ndifferent than those used by the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a\ndetailed discussion of the Firm\u2019s valuation process and hierarchy, and\nits determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.Goodwill impairment\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and\ntested for impairment at least annually. The Firm\u2019s process and\nmethodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described\nin Note 15.\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for\nimpairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination\nis allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment\ntesting.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm reviewed current\neconomic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as\nactual business results and projections of business performance.\nBased on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not\nimpaired as of December 31, 2022. For each of the reporting units,\nfair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10% and there was no\nindication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current\nprojections and valuations.\nThe projections for the Firm\u2019s reporting units are consistent with\nmanagement\u2019s current business outlook assumptions in the short\nterm, and the Firm\u2019s best estimates of long-term growth and return on\nequity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party\nand peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the\ngoodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2022.\nCredit card rewards liability\nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs\nwhich allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their\naccount activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program.\nGenerally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder\ncan earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed\nfor a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of\naccount credits), gift cards and travel.

This liability was $11.3 billion and $9.8\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded\nin accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. The increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in\nrewards points earned on increased cardholder spending and\npromotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2022.\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (\u201cRR\u201d) and cost\nper point (\u201cCPP\u201d) assumptions.

As of\nDecember 31, 2022, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR\nand 1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability by\napproximately $315 million.\nIncome taxes\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various\njurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and\nlocal, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and\nmay be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial\nstatement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the\nprovision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits,\nJPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how\nto interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous\ntransactions and business events, as well as make judgments\nregarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income\nin the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s interpretations of tax laws around the world are\nsubject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in\nthe jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur\nregarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over\ninterpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by\naudit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of\nthe tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase\nregularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes\nas a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records\nadditional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the\nFirm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in\nincome tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is\npossible that revisions in the Firm\u2019s estimate of income taxes may\nmaterially affect the Firm\u2019s results of operations in any reporting\nperiod.\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities\nmeasured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if, in management\u2019s judgment,\ntheir realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Deferred\ntaxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to\ntaxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are\nexpected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a\nchange in tax rates is recognized within the provision for income taxes\nin the period enacted.\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with\ncertain tax attributes, including net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d)\ncarryforwards and foreign tax credit (\u201cFTC\u201d) carryforwards. The Firm\nperforms regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets\nare realizable. These reviews include management\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions regarding future taxable income, including foreign\nsource income, and may incorporate various tax planning strategies,\nincluding strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and FTCs\nbefore they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is\ndetermined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation\nallowance isestablished. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a\nsubsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on\nrevised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning\nstrategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax\nasset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2022, management\nhas determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its\ndeferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when\nnew information becomes available, including changes in tax law and\nregulations, and interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are\nmeasured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An\nuncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit\nthat management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon\nsettlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nunrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective\nincome tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs.\nAlthough the Firm believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final\ntax amount could be different from the amounts reflected in the Firm\u2019s\nincome tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final\noutcome of these amounts is different than the amounts recorded,\nsuch differences will generally impact the Firm\u2019s provision for income\ntaxes in the period in which such a determination is made.\nThe Firm\u2019s provision for income taxes is composed of current and\ndeferred taxes.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4790, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "404c7179-dda5-400d-a0e3-cf3720435395": {"__data__": {"id_": "404c7179-dda5-400d-a0e3-cf3720435395", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02dc49de-63cf-483d-a97d-e624a2fbd512", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3f113d5a09e901f5703c758224644fdafa19dcf5d25d5e3fb72f9f2b1bc2c07f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "20ce3fef-e290-4237-969c-48181778bb65", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "71397450cdeb5c55f80af8cd581c74deaa70c699e1c4dd375313c2b272e8b39e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "281ff2db-80c9-4e43-bc8f-e898254ad46a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7855fa440dd46b70dcd08cc7005619116eddebf5d2d834c15aff0fa23f09c9c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cf8919ca2a10962205907c922186cd4a9b118cf8634c0fa7c94c6c72dd62fe24", "text": "Uncertain tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are\nmeasured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize.

Also, projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 300 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10017\n156 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 3393, "end_char_idx": 5715, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a72f99d-f659-4196-a005-2c22bc70ac67": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a72f99d-f659-4196-a005-2c22bc70ac67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50801394-cae7-4616-8d24-a1d3d8f97011", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "cbf9537a1aeb9575a3bbd67a62c5633cd5a1a5b654573c702dce1f5c35e94ce7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "15e10661-e056-4e9e-8673-3cd0b7f28933", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1c7254cf41fa6444a8847e89e432fedd70272a5bdafecaf6c98987d716f5b557", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "977a8a2a-e0ab-4345-a6ef-811263f9cde6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e58a109ee91aa7104de8906fd88d7c66f76397713a9507b691dcad1bd6e69292", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "007c256c80c6233072a1a7bf649d2e71d31f1d83ee52075c9e686c22892a8cdf", "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising\nfrom the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

The portfolio-based component of the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit card\nretained loan portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of\nexpected credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying\ncredit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss\nfactors applied are determined based on the weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take into\nconsideration the Firm's economic outlook as derived through\nforecast macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are\nU.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This\nquantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into consideration\nmodel imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other\nsubjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing\nprocedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-\nbased component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by\nmanagement in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically\nU.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the\nFirm\u2019s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect its estimate\nof expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in determining the\nquantitative calculation utilized in their credit loss estimates and the\nadjustments to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging\nrisk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet\notherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, which both in turn led\nto a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and inevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit loss\nestimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit\nloss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing\nthe effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses, including controls over model validation and generation of\nmacroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, among\nothers, testing management\u2019s process for estimating the allowance for\nloan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the\nmodels and methodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment\nand U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness\nand accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management\u2019s adjustments to the quantitative\noutput for the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet\notherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.

consolidated financial statements\nNote 1 \u2013 Basis of presentation\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial\nholding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a\nleading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations\nworldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial\nservices for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking,\nfinancial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to\nNote 32 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s business segments.\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase\nand its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where\napplicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting\nguidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to\nconform with the current presentation.\nConsolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of\nJPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm\nare not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in\nan entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity\nor a variable interest entity.\nVoting interest entities\nVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and\nprovide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make\nsignificant decisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations. For these types\nof entities, the Firm\u2019s determination of whether it has a controlling\ninterest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests\nheld. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest,\nthrough ownership of the majority of the entities\u2019 voting equity\ninterests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control,\nare consolidated by the Firm.\nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence\nover operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of\nthe voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with\nthe equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value\noption was elected. These investments are generally included in other\nassets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.\nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as\nlimited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these\nentities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the\nnon-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm\nas the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-\nout rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated\npartners or membershave rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm\ndoes not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the\nlimited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not\nhave substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates\nthe funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general\npartner or managing member and has both power and a potentially\nsignificant interest.\nThe Firm\u2019s investment companies and asset management funds have\ninvestments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including\ninvestments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities.\nThese investments are accounted for under investment company\nguidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity\nownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance\nsheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or\nloss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains\nthe accounting under such specialized investment company\nguidelines.\nVariable interest entities\nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to\npermit the entity to finance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity\ninvestors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions\nrelating to the entity\u2019s operations through voting rights, or do not have\nthe obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right\nto receive the residual returns of the entity.\nThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used\nin securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and\ndistribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic\nSPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE\nfunds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors.\nThe legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash\nearned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE\u2019s investors and\nother parties that have rights to those cash flows.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4982, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c452be5d-0a5b-4eb4-a965-e0f7c4669cae": {"__data__": {"id_": "c452be5d-0a5b-4eb4-a965-e0f7c4669cae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "166", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bfb25847-c528-402a-9fa6-ceaf4f8eed91", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "166", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5d5d0678a9c978ce20b9dabcf9350934d07b797e0d42fd6a1c611743c08ec3b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "114ad24a-b431-4a4e-90e3-22adf9a5a29f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "166", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "65ea435d23271aab9937e97857af07cdd82481d71bb4f21b00e3c42737338fc6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4e35898-d4fd-4f92-bedd-2515dda25d73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a523bd6b9e6393ff3db70ee29ddc69550bf7d2581aa4eb16611f38854de81f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "74bea48c7d3d0bf0d7acea8b2a687cf3d69619a87d3bf402a737031be880e2f0", "text": "The most common type of VIE is an SPE.

These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are\nmeasured and reported at fair value on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nbalance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-\nrelated commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis\nbut are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances\n(for example, when there is evidence of impairment).\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on\nquoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes\nare not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other\nvaluation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics\n(such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable\nmarket parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities,\nprices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign\nexchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be\nmade to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value,\nas described below.\nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or\nother factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a\nparticular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation\nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market\nparticipants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management\njudgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the\ndetermination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or\nassumptions by other market participants compared with those used\nby the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair\nvalue at the reporting date.\nValuation process\nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates\nfor assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at\nfair value. The Firm\u2019s Valuation Control Group (\u201cVCG\u201d), which is part\nof the Firm\u2019s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking\nfunctions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining\nany fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the\nFirm\u2019s positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm\u2019s\nValuation Governance Forum (\u201cVGF\u201d), which is composed of senior\nfinance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the\nmanagement of risks arising from valuation activities conducted\nacross the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head\nof the VCG (under the direction of the Firm\u2019s Controller), and includes\nsub-forums covering theCIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including\nTreasury and CIO.\nPrice verification process\nThe VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking\nfunctions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs\nand other market data, where available. Where independent prices or\ninputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to\nensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review\nmay include evaluating the limited market activity including client\nunwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar\ninstruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into\nindividual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows,\nreviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral\nvaluation. There are also additional levels of management review for\nmore significant or complex positions.\nThe VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required\nto the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions.

MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate\nactions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim.\nThese actions will depend on the model and may include, for\nexample, limitation of trading activity.\nFair value hierarchy\nA three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S.\nGAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value\nhierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an\nasset or liability as of the measurement date.

exceeding fair\nvalue less costs to sell (\u201ctransaction costs\u201d). Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory.\nTherefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is\nbelow cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value.\nRefer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have\nbeen included in each period presented.\n(c)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).(f)\n(a)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(a)\n(e)\n(d)\n(c)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 173", "start_char_idx": 1604, "end_char_idx": 4676, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee496344-5707-4333-b185-c85747459a09": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee496344-5707-4333-b185-c85747459a09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e21b127a-52dc-4a9a-b3bc-200c3d870824", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "14037339c74d291566f43b034024a9ea87932f6507c352ee9cdee1cecd57ca30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06f5b3ed-e36b-492b-9976-a51ea5237130", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f2b328c397838fea48355aef366334f3afc5d6b0168264e878ac633303a225bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a8a6bd8-17d1-48ef-8cd7-470bc5232370", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c61f97b7e96ff9ab5ad4e6c68f46cb8e56219060b455768fa9d4fd317396a9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ae5310b65a76d1e8da743766bbd78d7394f0564b81585fd38a1612250ea69451", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\n(d)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value\nhierarchy.

Refer to pages 167-171 of\nthis Note for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process and a\ndetailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual\nfinancial instruments.\nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type\nand level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of\nobservable market information available to the Firm. For instruments\nvalued using internally developed valuation models and other\nvaluation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments\nused to estimate fair value are more significant than those required\nwhen estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1\nand 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the appropriate valuation model or\nother valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of\nobservability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant\nempirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction\ndetails, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt\nprices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates\nand credit curves.\nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial\ninstruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value\nof those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the\nrange of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic\naverages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an\ninstrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3\nfinancial instruments typically include observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external\nsources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1\nand/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm\nmanages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are\nclassified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the\nhighest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of\ninstruments within a product/instrument classification. Where\nprovided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the\ntable are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the\ninput is being used to value.In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average\nvalues do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment\nof the reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions.\nRather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held\nby the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the\nrange of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have\nsimilar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but\nmay have significantly different implied volatility levels because the\noption contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.\nThe input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from\nperiod-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the\ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance\nsheet date.\n \nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 175", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3706, "text_template":

The impact of changes in inputs may\nnot be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give\nrise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships\ndo exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are\ndiscussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable\nand unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates\nrise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have\nnot been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the\nindividual relationships described below, the inverse relationship\nwould also generally apply.\nThe following discussion also provides a description of attributes of\nthe underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the\nrange of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions.\nYield \u2013 The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount\nfuture cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in\nthe yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value\nmeasurement.\nCredit spread \u2013 The credit spread is the amount of additional\nannualized return over the market interest rate that a market\nparticipant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an\ninstrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the\ndiscount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an\nincrease in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value\nmeasurement.\nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed\nsecurity primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield\nis also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the\ninstrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent\nrisk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the\nrange of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The\nrisk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the\nsubordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of\nthe underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including\nborrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the\nnature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages.\nFor corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the\ncredit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation.\nPrepayment speed \u2013 The prepayment speed is a measure of the\nvoluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable\nobligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally\ndecline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment\nspeeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value\nmeasurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in\na fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par.Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool,\nand are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower,\nand the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type\n(e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower.\nTypically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a\nhigher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality,\nall other factors being equal.\nConditional default rate \u2013 The conditional default rate is a measure of\nthe reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a\ncollateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically\nno direct relationship between conditional default rates and\nprepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying\ncollateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower\nconditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and\nan increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default\nrate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value\nmeasurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the\ncollateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the\nsecuritization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the\nFirm\u2019s market-making portfolios, conditional default rates are most\ntypically at the lower end of the range presented.\nLoss severity \u2013 The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery\nrate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from\nthe ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net\namount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase\nin loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional\ndefault rates.

Correlation is a pricing input for a\nderivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more\nunderlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative\n(e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity)\ndue to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are\npositively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an\nincrease in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively\ncorrelated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in\nthe other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an\nincrease or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short\ncorrelation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would\ngenerally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nThe level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with\nmultiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the\nnature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit\nrisk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate\nrisk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact\nthe correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks\nmay be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation\nlevels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have\na relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over\ntime, particularly in volatile market conditions.\nVolatility \u2013 Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns\nfor an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the\nparticular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time.\nVolatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options,\ncommodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the\nvolatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long\nposition in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would\ngenerally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.\nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based\nderivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the\nrisk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity\nsecurity may be significantly different from that of a particular\ncommodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike\nprice of the option.Bermudan switch value \u2013 The switch value is the difference between\nthe overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at\nmultiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption\nand reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise dates\nprovide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions\nand can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the\ntenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option.\nAn increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an\nincrease in a fair value measurement .\nInterest rate curve \u2013 represents the relationship of interest rates over\ndiffering tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input\nused in the discounting of any derivative cash flow.\nForward price \u2013 Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees\nto purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the\npredetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the\ncontract is zero at inception.\nThe forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain\nderivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest\nrates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected\nincome to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a\nresult of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the\nforward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value\nmeasurement.\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements\nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance\nsheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial\ninstruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nWhen a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within\nlevel 3, the determination is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However,\nlevel 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the\nunobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external\nsources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include\nchanges in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of\nthe valuation methodology.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4914, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "524173cf-a477-40f2-992a-7e2f83a61c7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "524173cf-a477-40f2-992a-7e2f83a61c7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39bc32d6-930a-41b7-9dc2-0de7bfa2f551", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1a36fd5baebc6d71f8590d36b778b5120715dd83d31ca4d6c277c748a40749ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce930e14-fa24-4e5d-8be8-6be008c15378", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "547407c0b68b9fdfa93155f1d319b1fdbb63e190cc2a5babd9711a1194fd5d13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "08301789-3ed5-41aa-b0a1-464f11742880", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "40ead40359a87a1ddf253950729f452ffea0211310bb390f15beda92e3f9f44e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f8508b113e9af542741785525369e3db3fbef2492cfc2ece604594ff5cfe4b3d", "text": "Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements\nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance\nsheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial\ninstruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nWhen a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within\nlevel 3, the determination is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.

These market parameters generally\ndo not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the\nFirm\u2019s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally\nnecessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to\nreflect these factors.\nCVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark\ninterest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk.\nThe Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the\nexpected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm\u2019s existing\npositions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on\nthe probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a\ncounterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to\nmitigate the Firm\u2019s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights\nof offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a\ndefault event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from\nobserved or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates\nimplied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in\nrecovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in\nCDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.\nFVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is\nrecognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the\nprincipal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument.\nThe Firm\u2019s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including\npartially collateralized) over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives\nincorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding\nrequirements arising from the Firm\u2019s positions witheach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated\nmarket funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative\nliabilities, considers the Firm\u2019s credit risk (DVA). For collateralized\nderivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future\ncash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the\nunderlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a\nseparate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and funding\nadjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective\nperiods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The\nFVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm\u2019s own credit\nquality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of\nchanges in the Firm\u2019s own credit quality over time.\nYear ended December 31, \n (in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA $ 22 $ 362 $ (337)\nDerivatives FVA 42 47 (64)\nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities\nThe valuation of the Firm\u2019s liabilities for which the fair value option has\nbeen elected requires consideration of the Firm\u2019s own credit risk.

In\nNovember 2022, the Firm sold approximately 3 million Visa B shares, resulting in a net pretax gain of $914 million recorded in other income. Visa B\nshares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (\u201cVisa A shares\u201d) at a specified conversion\nrate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. In connection with the sale, and consistent with the Firm\u2019s sale of 20 million Visa\nB shares in 2013, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares, under which the Firm retains the risk associated\nwith changes in the conversion rate.\nUnder the terms of the derivative instrument, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and\n(b) make periodic interest payments to the purchaser of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative continue as long as the Visa B\nshares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative is accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon\nthe Firm\u2019s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative is recorded in trading liabilities and\nchanges in fair value are recognized in other income. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with the 23 million\nVisa B shares that it has sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm\u2019s remaining interest in Visa B shares was approximately 37 million shares. On January 5, 2023, Visa filed a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.6059 to 1.5991\neffective December 29, 2022. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The\noutcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown, and\naccordingly, as of December 31, 2022, there is significant uncertainty regarding the date of the termination of transfer restrictions and the value of\nthe final conversion rate.

consolidated financial statements\nNote 4 \u2013 Credit risk concentrations\nConcentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients,\ncounterparties or customers are engaged in similar business activities\nor activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar\neconomic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual\nobligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic\nconditions.\nJPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit\nportfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain\nadditional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the\nFirm\u2019s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the\ncredit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as\nneeded to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk appetite.\nIn the Firm\u2019s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed\nprimarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus\non trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential\ncredit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in\nunderwriting policies and portfolio guidelines.

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives\nfor clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk\nexposures. Predominantly all of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are entered into\nfor market-making or risk management purposes.\nMarket-making derivatives\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are entered into for market-\nmaking purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest\nrate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm\nactively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by\nentering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling\nother financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure\nfrom client derivatives.\nRisk management derivatives\nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using\nderivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting\nrelationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks\nassociated with specified assets and liabilities.\nThe Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk\nassociated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and\nliabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates\nchange. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease\nas a result of variable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current\nmarket rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent\norigination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current\nmarket rates. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related\nto these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this\nvariability.\nForeign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign\nexchange risk associated with certain foreign currency\u2013denominated\n(i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted\ntransactions, as well as the Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S.\ndollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar\u2013\nequivalent values of the foreign currency\u2013denominated assets and\nliabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or\ndecrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to\nthese foreign currency\u2013denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted\ntransactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability.Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain\ncommodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative\ninstruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or\nappreciation of the related inventory.\nCredit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit\nderivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in\nthe contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a\nfailure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily\nconsist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 205-\n207 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on\npage 205 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages\n202-204 of this Note for more information about risk management\nderivatives.\nDerivative counterparties and settlement types\nThe Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and\nsettled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also\nenters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and\nOTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are\ngenerally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared\nby the CCP, which is the Firm\u2019s counterparty from the inception of the\ntransactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis\nand then novated to the CCP for clearing.\nDerivative clearing services\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts\nas a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The\nFirm does not reflect the clients\u2019 derivative contracts in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s clearing services.\nAccounting for derivatives\nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own\naccount are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance\nsheets at fair value.\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and\nliabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables,\nwhen a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between\nthe Firm and the derivative counterparty.

However, JPMorgan Chase does not\nseek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated\nwith the Firm\u2019s risk management activities. For example, the Firm\ndoes not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage\nthe credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of\nthe difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same\nreason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest\nrate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk\nmanagement purposes.\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective\nat reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In\naddition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk\nmanagement objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge\ndocumentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the\nasset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be\nhedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed\nprospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm\nuses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical\nmethods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair\nvalue of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of\nthe hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the\nevaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a\nderivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly\neffective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the\nhedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If\nit is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the\ndesignated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.\nThere are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan\nChase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term\ndebt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For\nqualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the\nderivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being\nhedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from\nthe assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized\nin earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is\nterminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be\nreported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark\ninterest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment.\nDerivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with\nthe classification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily net interest income\nand principal transactions revenue.\nJPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the\nexposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate\nassets and liabilities and foreign currency\u2013denominated revenue and\nexpense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of\nthe derivative arerecorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item\naffects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are\nrecognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item \u2013\nprimarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation\nexpense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in\nvalue of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings\nwhen the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge\nrelationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction\nis expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any\nrelated derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately\nrecognized in earnings.\nJPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of\nthe Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or\nbranches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For\nqualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the\nderivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are\nrecorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from\nthe assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 195", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4369, "text_template":

Credit\nderivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of\nthe protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make\npayments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a\ncredit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a\nrestructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for\nproviding protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument\nreferenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.\nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit\nderivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary\npurposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively\nmanages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling\ncredit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet\nthe needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit\nderivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures\n(loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer\nbusinesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its wholesale\nbusinesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain\nfinancial instruments in the Firm\u2019s market-making businesses.\nFollowing is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 205", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3939, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f5af8a8-7c9f-48e5-9b50-669f380f23ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f5af8a8-7c9f-48e5-9b50-669f380f23ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "208", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cd5973c7-e705-4e15-ab53-8168be420c54", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "208", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9a59f31ddcd9f0b86c3c79df46bb141361733f9e03f19788425695db680e263a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b211c74-a117-4a2b-9c48-4f3b83aa7044", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "207", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e50feb0165049d1d155063f1b725a788d0a2d35319f42985f5c890e860c03fca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ff755c1-a7a8-49d3-8849-3147013f6e13", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d737fb749dbaa539d1eb6d345bbe9a78afff0919ffe93414f26e978d3e2ab1fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "79faafa01ede5820c0d472168cc64a4874eefb871e79ea02d4d01aa3793723c5", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit default swaps\nCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference\nentity (\u201csingle-name\u201d), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm\npurchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-\nreference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are\neither OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS\nare used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while\nindex CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated\nwith the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the\nS&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio\nof CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices\nare periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of\nreference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the\nreference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the\nreference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can\nalso be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or\nagainst customized exposure levels based on specific client\ndemands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1\nmillion of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure.\nSuch structures are commonly known as tranche CDS.\nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon\nthe occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract\nneither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity.\nThe protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the\ndifference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair\nvalue of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative\ncontract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser\ndoes not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference\nentity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a\ncredit event occurs.Credit-related notes\nA credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk\ncomponent where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from\nthe note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index.\nUnder the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the\nnote at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays\nperiodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the\nreferenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of\nthe note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities\nthat makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit\nevent. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the\npar value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the\ndifference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the\ndefaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party\nto the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference\nentity.\nThe following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of\ncredit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and\npurchased as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Upon a credit event,\nthe Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a\npercentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the\namount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into\naccount the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of\nsettlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell\nprotection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying\nreference entities.

Employees can contribute to the\n401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis.\nThe Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well as an annual\nprofit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of\neligible participants.\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in AOCI on the\nConsolidated balance sheets for the Firm\u2019s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,Defined benefit \n pension and OPEB plans\n(in millions) 2022 2021\nProjected benefit obligations $ (13,545) $ (18,046)\nFair value of plan assets 19,890 25,692 \nNet funded status 6,345 7,646 \nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (1,916) (453)\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 5.14% and 2.54%, respectively.\nGains and losses\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and\nthe fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI. Amortization of net\ngains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost\nover subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net\ngain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit\nobligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally\nover the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants,\ngiven the frozen status of most plans. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm\u2019s U.S. principal\ndefined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of apension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the\nfair value of the Firm\u2019s U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets,\nreflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a\nreduction in the plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation totaling $4.0 billion\nand $2.6 billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $1.4 billion\nin pre-tax AOCI. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net gain\nwas predominantly attributable to market-driven increases in the fair\nvalue of plan assets and the discount rate.\nThe following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension,\ndefined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3727, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "165cb3de-af1a-462c-a79a-c0e76fd102be": {"__data__": {"id_": "165cb3de-af1a-462c-a79a-c0e76fd102be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "214", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5902cf5-f6d3-44ec-b3a3-a0aaa6ca8b90", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "214", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f521b91d8e77661e01f7cbf5e7203c96c38c3878d24fcdcd90d85e9365aa6fc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ed356bd-987c-40e7-9d99-5a25d2bcbd00", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "214", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "fd81fcf05b6d601951dcfd0b8c2265b3215ff13f3b0ba3a541cb6d67a168ad88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bfefcfc5-547f-49e7-8a63-db69e668ad36", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c0f2f979e49c5bd9429f8b04454c197766e2e3c0fc573e4c8ee75ebf3d7c99d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "846c59cc6e0883e67dd5fe9472c242ff62f98a0409d02c56cfdc823244bc36ad", "text": "principal\ndefined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of apension settlement.

long-term share-\nbased awards to certain employees under its LTIP, as amended and\nrestated effective May 15, 2018, and subsequently amended effective\nMay 18, 2021. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2022,\n69 million shares of common stock were available for issuance\nthrough May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the\nFirm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the\nfollowing discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans\nassumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as\nthe \u201cLTI Plans,\u201d and such plans constitute the Firm\u2019s share-based\nincentive plans.\nRSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant.\nGenerally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after\ntwo years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of\ncommon stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically\ninclude full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to\ncontinue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or\nservice-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other\nrestrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and\ncontain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under\ncertain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the\nrecipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid\non the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are\noutstanding.\nPerformance share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) are granted annually, and\napproved by the Firm\u2019s Board of Directors, to members of the Firm\u2019s\nOperating Committee under the variable compensation program.\nPSUs are subject to the Firm\u2019s achievement of specified performance\ncriteria over a three-year period. The number of awards that vest can\nrange from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends\nthat accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend\nequivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent\nshare units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting.Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the\nshares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax\nwithholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a\ntotal combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to\neight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain\ncountries.\nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d) and stock\noptions have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to\nthe fair value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s common stock on the grant date.\nSARs and stock options generally expire ten years after the grant\ndate. In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer 1.5 million and 750,000 SARs,\nrespectively. There were no grants of SARs or stock options in 2022\nand grants in 2020 were not material.\nThe Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each\ntranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a\nseparate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche\ngranted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis\nfrom the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche,\nprovided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during\nthe vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and\nawards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the\nFirm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded\nto employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the\nimpact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to\nemployees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting\nperiod, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis\nfrom the grant date until the earlier of the employee\u2019s full-career\neligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche.\nThe Firm\u2019s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee\nshare-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of\ncommon stock or treasury shares.

Risk ratings are\nassigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by\nCredit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of\nthe investment for updated information affecting the issuer\u2019s ability to\nfulfill its obligations.(b)(c) (b)(c)\n(a)\n218 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 2304, "end_char_idx": 4087, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2dd1e2c4-538a-45fb-8bb6-8d1224e3d769": {"__data__": {"id_": "2dd1e2c4-538a-45fb-8bb6-8d1224e3d769", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6a35deb0-0f16-4f13-823d-4cdcc41f1bf0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "be99e6a9573dde21113467af941fbdce2a1b960757d9ddc2aba6747c8cd0d935", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "78b7dee6-1ac2-4a27-a1ae-e225cbdf7ae4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "220", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1eba14f387f0da2030bdb0dbc8c3ffadc49232982103d7fc1d80f9e354cc14d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf770949-6fcf-455d-a66e-aceed421ccf0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b777df7e812f50001c18afaf913401bf809238d351216e91499eca6c1f2f66c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b4b04835e3c9a4cb09b053f4e0bdd4d8a8e155ea515d198c8003d3774e6725ae", "text": "AFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

In these circumstances the impairment loss is\nrecognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income and is equal to the full difference between the\namortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the\nsecurity.\nFor impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to\nhold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If\nit is determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an\nallowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount of\nimpairment. Any impairment on debt securities that the Firm has the\nintent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is recorded in OCI.\nFactors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse\nconditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or\nfinancial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security;\nand payment structure of the security.\nWhen assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses,\nthe Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and\neconomic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of\nthe securitization, such as subordination, excess spread,\novercollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and\ncompares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (\u201cpool\nlosses\u201d) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization\nstructure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb\nthe pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.\nFor beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below \u201cAA\u201d at\ntheir acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise\nsettled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all\nof its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit\nlosses when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows.HTM securities \u2013 credit risk\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe allowance for credit losses represents expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of HTM securities.\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is\ncalculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and\nLGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived using\na weighted average of five internally developed eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line\ninterpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods\nbeyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further information on\nthe eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast.\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations\nand U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities\nis calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the\npresent value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted\nat the security\u2019s effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are\ndeveloped based on expectations of underlying collateral\nperformance derived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast\nand the single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering\nthe structural features of the security.\nThe application of different inputs and assumptions into the\ncalculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to significant\nmanagement judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption\nover another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect\nthe estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.\nCredit quality indicator\nThe primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk rating\nassigned to each security. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, all\nHTM securities were rated investment grade and were current and\naccruing, with approximately 98% rated at least AA+.\n \nAllowance for credit losses on

The effective yield\nconsiders the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where\napplicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as\ncertain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b)Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-\naverage life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential MBS, and six years for both agency residential collateralized mortgage\nobligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.(b)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 221", "start_char_idx": 1851, "end_char_idx": 3783, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82b91427-8796-435f-8930-80b498d94ad9": {"__data__": {"id_": "82b91427-8796-435f-8930-80b498d94ad9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "224", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c2acf3f4-1f11-490c-8c9f-d767842179fc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "224", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b1b733186bf24e710b9086157a797ece15ce6a957e8b34d36e0a38192dcffbae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36e5930d-dadf-4caa-8df5-a386712cf929", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "223", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "49da73e4179a6347818c5da7584bcfbb3446cae801d8d0fefef49db86c061020", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8487f7f-58c2-46df-bb46-622c1a008e93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "18ee74187f16a0a6e5959ae96f7d82dfcd8003f2c0862ac106c11196577e7202", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8621ff76b42c9e09cc50a101850b40a54436ba3444c3e92ab9be9bddd55b5561", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 1 1 \u2013 Securities financing activities\nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed\nand securities loaned agreements (collectively, \u201csecurities financing\nagreements\u201d) primarily to finance the Firm\u2019s inventory positions,\nacquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers\u2019\nfinancing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the\nFirm\u2019s excess cash.\nSecurities financing agreements are treated as collateralized\nfinancings on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets. Where\nappropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities\nfinancing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a\nnet basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of\nassets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with\nsecurities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the\nagreement in interest income and interest expense on the\nConsolidated statements of income.\nThe Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities\nfinancing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information\nregarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements\nfor which the fair value option has been elected are reported within\nsecurities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or\nsold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair\nvalue, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest\nincome and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in\nprincipal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments\ncontaining embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted\nfor in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all\nchanges in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in\nprincipal transactions revenue.\nSecurities financing agreements not elected under the fair value\noption are measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm\u2019s credit\nrisk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold any\nallowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities\nborrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.Credit risk mitigation practices\nSecurities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit\nand liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value\nof the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities\ncollateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and\ngovernment agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its\ncounterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and\nexchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or\nreturns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are\ninitially established based upon the counterparty, the type of\nunderlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are\nmonitored on an ongoing basis.\nIn resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to\ncredit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less\nthan initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts\nexchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit\nrisk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying\nsecurities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal\nreceived, and any collateral amounts exchanged.\nAdditionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements\nand other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide\nfor the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral\namounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also\nthe Firm\u2019s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities\nunderlying resale and securities borrowed agreements.

The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:\n\u2022Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., \u201cretained\u201d)\n\u2022Loans held-for-sale\n\u2022Loans at fair value\nThe following provides a detailed accounting discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nloans by category:\nLoans held-for-investment\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment, including PCD,\nare recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount\noutstanding, net of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees,\ncosts, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and\nforeign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance\ncharges and fees.\nInterest income\nInterest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued\nand recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest.\nPurchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan\nfees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual\nlife of the loan as an adjustment of yield.\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but\nunbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts\nreceivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card\nloans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan\nbalances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for\ncredit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued\ninterest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit\nlosses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income.\nFor other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance\nfor credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its\npolicy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing\ninterest income.\nNonaccrual loans\nNonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been\nsuspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer\nloans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on\nnonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment\nof principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency\nstatus, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period\nof 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the\nprocess of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the\nminimum payment is not received from the borrower by the\ncontractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential\nreal estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30\ndays or more.Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on\nnonaccrual status.\nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued\nbut not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the\namortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on\nnonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are\nreceived (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is\ndeemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the\nultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash\nreceipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost\nrecovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy\ntypically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual\nconsumer loans on a cash basis.\nA loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is\nreasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance\nunder the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the\nrestructured loan.\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally\nexempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest\nand fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan\nis charged off or paid in full.\nAllowance for loan losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected\ncredit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance\nsheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset,\nwhich brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in\nthe allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit\nlosses on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated statements of income.

The determination of whether to recognize a\ncharge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the\nFirm\u2019s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring\nof the loan and valuation of the borrower\u2019s equity or the loan\ncollateral.\nWhen a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the\nestimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the\ndetermination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of\ncollateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is\nin the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted\nmarket prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial\nassets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow model.\nFor residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon\nexternal valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is\neither unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker\u2019s price\nopinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home\nbased on an exterior-only valuation (\u201cexterior opinions\u201d), which is then\nupdated at least every 12 months, or more frequently depending on\nvarious market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives\nthe property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or\nphysical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based\non an inspection that includes the interior of the home (\u201cinterior\nappraisals\u201d). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted\nbased upon the Firm\u2019s experience with actual liquidation values as\ncompared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and\ninterior appraisals, considering state-specific factors.\nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally\nbased on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources.\nCollateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months,\neither by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal\nanalysis, in accordance with the Firm\u2019s policies. The Firm also\nconsiders both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may\nresult in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more\nfrequent intervals.Loans held-for-sale\nLoans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value,\nwith valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For\nconsumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For\nwholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan\nbasis.\nInterest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized\nbased on the contractual rate of interest.\nLoan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or\npremiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan\nis sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an\nadjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the\nperiodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments\nand/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.\nBecause these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value,\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not\napply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the\nnonaccrual policies described above.\nLoans at fair value\nLoans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured\nat fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest\nrevenue.\nInterest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on\nthe contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized\nin noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront\nin noninterest revenue.

Credit-related losses are charged\nagainst the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such\nas those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency\nexchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue.\nIn the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-\nsale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment\nportfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are\nsubsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm\u2019s allowance\nmethodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the\nmethodologies used in establishing the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss\nmitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase\ngrants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm\u2019s economic loss and\navoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately\nmaximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The\nconcessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific\ncharacteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term\nextensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance\nof equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are\naccounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other\ninsignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not\nTDRs.\nLoans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were\nalready on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may\nbe returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if\nthe following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under\nthe modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments,\nand (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified\nloan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower\u2019s\ndebt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV\nratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and\nwell-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the\nmodification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at\nthe time of modification.\nLoans modified in TDRs are generally measured for impairment using\nthe Firm\u2019s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which\nconsiders the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan\nmodified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific\ncomponent of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless\nof whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual\nstatus. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology\nused to estimate the Firm\u2019s asset-specific allowance.Foreclosed property\nThe Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan\nrestructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may\ninclude real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings)\nand commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft,\nrailcars, and ships).\nThe Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in\nsatisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical\npossession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm\ngenerally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon\nthe execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the\nborrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the\nConsolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less\nestimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired\nproperty is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or\nfair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited\nto noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes\nand maintenance, are charged to other expense.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 227", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4179, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3cce2eea-c786-4673-a132-6c90d02de61e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3cce2eea-c786-4673-a132-6c90d02de61e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "230", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6d8adcd-c353-403c-9575-2db9c262eadf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "230", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "903c0d5c806fb5f046173efe4728daaaf8727a5e7fdbaab638fdcf6cb194c04a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab31ff8b-9c1c-4617-8899-8c37133e9e9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "583c03ed2df2eabf4549b05f563469122b51c29a990a515e74182a9e67e0f06e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "726fec55-2677-4f39-ab96-10d2a12bbff0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6950355f9d163ba6f367c98a0c03ec44d3d63890e2779a3cf11a9bbae22416fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fb8381da3348bd0a275d87d98a157d27a05216f41b638595cd39cf34fb69caef", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm\u2019s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan\nlosses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale.

The portfolio also includes home equity loans\nsecured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only\npayment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in\nnegative amortization.\nThe following table provides information about retained consumer\nloans, excluding credit card, by class.\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2022 2021\nResidential real estate $ 237,561 $ 224,795 \nAuto and other 63,192 70,761 \nTotal retained loans $ 300,753 $ 295,556 \n(a)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $350 million and $5.4 billion of loans,\nrespectively, in Business Banking under the PPP.Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for\nconsumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide\nan early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial\ndifficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan.\nAs the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the\nborrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of\nresidential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than\n150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately\nresult in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to\ndelinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans\nvary based on the class of loan, as follows:\n\u2022For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or\nthe combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an\nindicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default.\nAdditionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a\nborrower\u2019s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of\nhigh-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the\nborrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of\nthe loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of\nthe portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price\nchanges and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect\ncredit quality. The borrower\u2019s current or \u201crefreshed\u201d FICO score is\na secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO\nscores are an indication of the borrower\u2019s credit payment history.\nThus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is\nconsidered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a\nhigher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV\nratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan\nto a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO\nscore.\n\u2022For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic\ndistribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio.\nSimilar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution\nprovides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional\neconomic activity and events.(a)\n230 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3183, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85eb8297-4488-45b1-b992-6c41429595a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "85eb8297-4488-45b1-b992-6c41429595a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "233", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b6614220-cac9-47d8-9761-674c533c82c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "233", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "03ec04f07cb88674e7dd87e296c95b035621675ecdc5c88ed31bd626fbb8ac2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b0f2fc1-2ea9-43a7-bfd5-92ed2c36a533", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "232", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "928d6d4a17e1afbe97f830014e490cf739de81f7386927ccf480ec1b3650ef2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f760df1e-7f86-4c26-91c5-54cb4c566378", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ddeab9e738a08d793b3edb43b316a85faf7c5698911dc721830e61bf600b0def", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "079612efe013745439b824b8ec05a603d3772ac20dc818b517b663135319a9e5", "text": "Residential real estate\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.\n(in millions, except ratios)December 31, 2022\nTerm loans by origination year Revolving loans\nTotal 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Prior to 2018Within the\nrevolving periodConverted to\nterm loans\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent $ 39,934  $ 66,072  $ 43,315  $ 15,397  $ 6,339  $ 49,632  $ 5,589  $ 9,685  $ 235,963  \n30\u2013149 days past due 29 11 14 20 20 597 15 208 914 \n150 or more days past due 1 1 6 10 7 480 4 175 684 \nTotal retained loans $ 39,964  $ 66,084  $ 43,335  $ 15,427  $ 6,366  $ 50,709  $ 5,608  $ 10,068  $ 237,561  \n% of 30+ days past due to\ntotal retained loans 0.08 % 0.02 % 0.05 % 0.19 % 0.42 % 2.07 % 0.34 % 3.80 % 0.66 %\n(in millions, except ratios)December 31, 2021\nTerm loans by origination year Revolving loans\nTotal 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Prior to 2017Within the\nrevolving periodConverted to\nterm loans\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent $ 68,742 $ 48,334 $ 18,428 $ 7,929 $ 11,684 $ 49,147 $ 6,392 $ 11,807 $ 222,463 \n30\u2013149 days past due 13 23 27 27 22 578 11 182 883 \n150 or more days past due \u2014 11 21 25 33 1,069 6 284 1,449 \nTotal retained loans $ 68,755 $ 48,368 $ 18,476 $ 7,981 $ 11,739 $ 50,794 $ 6,409 $ 12,273 $ 224,795 \n% of 30+ days past due to\ntotal retained loans 0.02 % 0.07 % 0.26 % 0.65 % 0.47 % 3.18 % 0.27 % 3.80 % 1.02 %\n(a)Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(b)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing\naccording to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.\n(c)Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

However, certain cardholders\u2019 FICO scores may\ndecrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder\nand changes in the credit score calculation.\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained credit card loans.\n \n(in millions, except ratios)December 31, 2022\nWithin the revolving period Converted to term loans Total\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent and less than 30 days past due\n and still accruing $ 181,793  $ 696 $ 182,489  \n30\u201389 days past due and still accruing 1,356  64 1,420  \n90 or more days past due and still accruing 1,230  36 1,266  \nTotal retained loans $ 184,379  $ 796 $ 185,175  \nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans 1.40 % 12.56  % 1.45 %\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained loans 0.67 4.52 0.68 \n \n(in millions, except ratios)December 31, 2021\nWithin the revolving period Converted to term loans Total\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent and less than 30 days past due\n and still accruing $ 151,798 $ 901 $ 152,699 \n30\u201389 days past due and still accruing 770 59 829 \n90 or more days past due and still accruing 741 27 768 \nTotal retained loans $ 153,309 $ 987 $ 154,296 \nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans 0.99 % 8.71 % 1.04 %\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained loans 0.48 2.74 0.50 \n(a)Represents TDRs.(a)\n(a)\n236 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2829, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2dd170e-c3eb-463c-a416-80d3bcdc7a2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2dd170e-c3eb-463c-a416-80d3bcdc7a2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "239", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1ac66c9e-7456-4908-bbce-d4315efa14cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "239", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b0420658a4efe6d67a0c570411bc3a86650a14af53a0471e9589c53275c33ebe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "27bdea4d-cf20-4f5a-95f1-76533090deed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "238", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "22e1159fbe6ebee08f0ddf8be4d36bd41bc145fb52c5634f00e8713eb948ba2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6b54224-5c95-4482-ad77-b7b3a1df0c80", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae313d55f9b204d8df9858134ee318a08b102a8c4d06d35e27a92cd3d9d224f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cf7877cdd43bf2b7a83665b86c3fc5750534c0614fbf03ce69f18b7ca6843fa4", "text": "Other credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on other credit quality indicators for retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except ratios) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nGeographic region\nCalifornia $ 28,154 $ 23,030 \nTexas 19,171 15,879 \nNew York 15,046 12,652 \nFlorida 12,905 10,412 \nIllinois 10,089 8,530 \nNew Jersey 7,643 6,367 \nOhio 5,792 4,923 \nPennsylvania 5,517 4,708 \nColorado 5,493 4,573 \nArizona 4,487 3,668 \nAll other 70,878 59,554 \nTotal retained loans $ 185,175 $ 154,296 \nPercentage of portfolio based on carrying value with estimated refreshed FICO scores\nEqual to or greater than 660 86.8 % 88.5 %\nLess than 660 13.0 11.3 \nNo FICO available 0.2 0.2 \n(a)The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 2022.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm may offer loan modification programs granting concessions\nto credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty.

Risk ratings are used to identify the\ncredit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk\nratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the\nlikelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on\nthe loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and\ntakes into consideration collateral and structural support for each\ncredit facility.\nManagement considers several factors to determine an appropriate\ninternal risk rating, including the obligor\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, the level of the obligor\u2019s earnings, the amount and sources\nfor repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management\nstrength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor\noperates. The Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings generally align with the\nqualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial\ncommitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic\nenvironment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative\ncharacteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal\nhistorical experiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers\ninternal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to\nBBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a\nlower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized\nand criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into\nperforming and nonaccrual loans, representing management\u2019s\nassessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized\nloans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm\u2019s definition\nof criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of\ncriticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard\nand doubtful categories.\nRisk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit\nRisk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated\ninformation affecting the obligor\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.\nAs noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in\nwhich the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit\nrisk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management\nand diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular\nattention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern.\nRefer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.\n238 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2798, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "815f8ef1-1681-49ce-a1e1-079d380e271e": {"__data__": {"id_": "815f8ef1-1681-49ce-a1e1-079d380e271e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "241", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b1ed8d43-2537-49dc-b476-f49db83f3773", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "241", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "7fb2523e9df08864ee263606c822d68d4c5461cb57a72d744708777d0266fdfd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6b54224-5c95-4482-ad77-b7b3a1df0c80", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "240", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ae313d55f9b204d8df9858134ee318a08b102a8c4d06d35e27a92cd3d9d224f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6700b54c-0f4d-447e-b628-2886a1f6040b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8bc990206cd362f90316fbddef8cb1efb1bc53ad22a3e5f1623920b4ee2f06fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ae31f69bffb818b4d1537fe6ecb63dc2deb37257ca2e476966ed869077d2f5c1", "text": "The following tables provide information on internal risk rating, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except ratios)Secured by real estate Commercial and industrial Other Total retained loans\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nLoans by risk ratings\nInvestment-grade $ 99,552 $ 92,369 $ 76,275 $ 75,783 $ 249,585 $ 241,859 $ 425,412 $ 410,011 \nNoninvestment- grade:\nNoncriticized 23,272 22,495 81,393 62,039 57,888 52,440 162,553 136,974 \nCriticized performing 3,662 3,645 8,974 6,900 1,106 770 13,742 11,315 \nCriticized nonaccrual 246 326 1,018 969 699 759 1,963 2,054 \nTotal noninvestment- grade 27,180 26,466 91,385 69,908 59,693 53,969 178,258 150,343 \nTotal retained loans $ 126,732 $ 118,835 $ 167,660 $ 145,691 $ 309,278 $ 295,828 $ 603,670 $ 560,354 \n% of investment-grade to total\nretained loans 78.55 % 77.73 % 45.49 % 52.02 % 80.70 % 81.76 % 70.47 % 73.17 %\n% of total criticized to total\nretained loans 3.08 3.34 5.96 5.40 0.58 0.52 2.60 2.39 \n% of criticized nonaccrual to\ntotal retained loans 0.19 0.27 0.61 0.67 0.23 0.26 0.33 0.37 \n(a)At December 31, 2021 nonaccrual loans excluded $127 million of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, predominantly in commercial and industrial.

The allowance for credit\nlosses comprises:\n\u2022the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the\nConsolidated balance sheets,\n\u2022the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented\non the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other\nliabilities, and\n\u2022the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is\nreflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\nThe income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses is recognized in the provision for credit losses.\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is\ncomplex and requires significant judgment by management about the\neffect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the\nallowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the\nController of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures,\nconsidering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other\nfactors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the\nallowance for credit losses in future periods.\nThe Firm\u2019s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses\nand its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in\nthe following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the\npolicies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities.\nMethodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments\nThe allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related\ncommitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining\nexpected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that\nare not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an\nallowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-\nrelated commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to\naccrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an\nallowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to\nwrite these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing\ninterest income.\nThe expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its\ncontractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and\ncertain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit\ncard loans is generally estimated by considering expected future\npayments on the credit card account, and determining how much of\nthose amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan\nbalance (as of the balance sheet date)versus other account activity. This allocation is made using an\napproach that incorporates the payment application requirements of\nthe Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of\n2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first.\nThe estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries\nof amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even\nif such recoveries result in a negative allowance.\nCollective and Individual Assessments\nWhen calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for\nlending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures\nshare similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist,\nthe Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the\nrisk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the\nexposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment\nof risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment.\nEmphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional\ncharacteristics could affect the allowance.\n\u2022Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include\nproduct type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic\ndistribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios.\n\u2022Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include risk\nrating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB,\ngeography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility\npurpose, and payment terms.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s credit exposures share risk characteristics\nwith other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed\nfor impairment (\u201cportfolio-based component\u201d). The portfolio-based\ncomponent covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and\ncertain lending-related commitments.\nIf an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other\nexposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an\nindividual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions\nimpacting that individual exposure (\u201casset-specific component\u201d).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5074, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d515706a-79ff-4795-898b-527a587714de": {"__data__": {"id_": "d515706a-79ff-4795-898b-527a587714de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e70a0daa-ff45-4e77-a44c-98fc7b6e97f4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "776021bb25290c77cee3ec8637b0e711f14a4aae281acc38c3dca4f64a3d47c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "52edb891-2832-4f5c-8bf1-73450b2ffc9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "962cb9c9df8991c760bcf2020d639fc12d71e21a5eaa10775e01a6cfd4360896", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "01f2f054-8873-4041-9edc-6e5cd6ff3076", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "40e0edf1abe30089494ffd49d653a091a6ee5212773179ae4f67d6f7508436b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7332d2d7eb35f2ceb495493059b0a5e36364e6c7c4ee3cd59a6302287fd68907", "text": "\u2022Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include\nproduct type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic\ndistribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios.\n\u2022Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include risk\nrating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB,\ngeography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility\npurpose, and payment terms.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s credit exposures share risk characteristics\nwith other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed\nfor impairment (\u201cportfolio-based component\u201d).

The\nfive macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse,\nextreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and\nare updated by the Firm\u2019s central forecasting team. The scenarios\ntake into consideration the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, internal\nperspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market\nconsensus and involve a governed process that incorporates\nfeedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance\nand Risk Management.\nThe quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration\nmodel imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other\nsubjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These\nadjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss\nexperience, including during stressed periods, for each major product\nor model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment,\nincluding taking into account uncertainties associated with the\neconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards,\nborrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an\nindustry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and\nexternal factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain\ninstances, the interrelationships between these factors create further\nuncertainties.\nThe application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and\nthe assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative\ncalculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and\nemphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering\nother inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the\nallowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related\ncommitments.\nAsset-specific component\nTo determine the asset-specific component of the allowance,\ncollateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which\nforeclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the\nwholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually, while\nsmaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for\nevaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets.\nThe Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the\ndifference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present\nvalue of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the\nloan\u2019s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in\nimpairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the\nallowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair\nvalue of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the\ncharge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost\nof the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative\nallowance that should berecognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with\nimprovements in the fair value of collateral).\nThe asset-specific component of the allowance for loans that have\nbeen or are expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect\nof the modification on the loan\u2019s expected cash flows (including\nforgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions),\nand also the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans\nmodified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops\nproduct-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at\na loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these\nprobabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between\nthe credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain\nassumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon\nindustry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss\nexperience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For\ncredit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs,\nexpected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs\nbased on the Firm\u2019s historical experience by type of modification\nprogram. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be modified in\nTDRs, expected losses incorporate management\u2019s expectation of the\nborrower\u2019s ability to repay under the modified terms.\nEstimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly\njudgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such\nas loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault\nrates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or\nprincipal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other\nfactors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions.\nThese estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the\nduration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or\nborrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency\nproceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic\nfactors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant\nmanagement judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 243", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5266, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7af880db-add8-4fc6-b268-3115e4f3460e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7af880db-add8-4fc6-b268-3115e4f3460e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6683f8dd-c841-4e4f-983b-9a4a8bf007ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "552ebb8bdd9bba4b87735015205c97196d457e565787a5b2a7124d92d6a3c69d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "01f2f054-8873-4041-9edc-6e5cd6ff3076", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "245", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "40e0edf1abe30089494ffd49d653a091a6ee5212773179ae4f67d6f7508436b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2b5712f-542b-4739-a048-9e62613fae70", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "847eeed25500dfa0023a1459d12c30445ce4e2aad361798bf3eae80e516231c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "997993aa874f95ef8cb7a08a80091c3fbd12135d41fd41381cb64c6970eb96e6", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related\ncommitments by impairment methodology.

billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services,\nreflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the\nFirm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the\nallowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with\nborrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.\nDeterioration in the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook included both\nupdates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which\nnow reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased\nweight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in

As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a\nfee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund\u2019s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as\nVIEs, AWM\u2019s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of\nthese entities.\n\u2022Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored\nentities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are\nreported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third-party transaction.\n\u2022Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized\ninvestment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in\nsecurities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm\ndoes not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for\nfurther information on the Firm\u2019s investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties.

CCB generally retains servicing for all residential\nmortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage\nloans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by\nCCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the\nVIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan\nmodifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon\nsecuritization.\nIn addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities\ninvolving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As\na result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests\n(including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant\nto credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at\nthe time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary\nmarket in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a\nresult of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by\nTreasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together with the\nservicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to\nbe the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts.\nThe Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations\n(Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer\n(and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant\nactivities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust\nthat could potentially be significant to the trust.\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations\nCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and\nengages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities\nissued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held\npursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm\ndoes not service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO\nmay choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For commercial\nmortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of\nthe VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified\nclass of securities (\u201ccontrolling class\u201d).

The conduits\nfund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated\ncommercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the\ncommercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most\ninstances, the assets are structured with deal-specific credit\nenhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e.,\nsellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific credit enhancements are\ngenerally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected\non the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of\novercollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit\nenhancements mitigate the Firm\u2019s potential losses on its agreements\nwith the conduits.\nTo ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide\nthe conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the\nevent that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper\nmarket, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum\n100% deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also\nprovides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-\nwide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the\nform of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit\nenhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and\napproximates 10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.\nThe Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as\nthe Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the\nconduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the\nconduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring\ntransactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and\ncredit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of\nthe conduits. The Firm\u2019s interests that could potentially be significant\nto the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and\nliquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as\nthe potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit\nenhancement facilities provided to the conduits.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in\nand invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits. The Firm held $13.8 billion and $13.7 billion of\nthe commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. The Firm\u2019s investments reflect the\nFirm\u2019s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market\nilliquidity.

In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated\nmunicipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by\nissuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates\n(\u201cfloaters\u201d) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (\u201cresiduals\u201d).\nThe floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other\nshort-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the\nTOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to\nfinance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the\nresidual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as\ncustomer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions\nwhere the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are\nsponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-\ncustomer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to\na TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option\nprovider, and/or sponsor.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the\nfloaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for\nestablishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the\ninitial placement and remarketing tendered floaters.

These include, for example, acting as a derivative\ncounterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent,\nremarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are\nconducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions are based\non the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the\npower to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact\nthe VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest that could\npotentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the\nVIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report\npositions in respect of any other third-party transaction.\nTax credit vehicles\nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles,\nwhich are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and\noperate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities\nare primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general\npartner or managing member and has control over the significant\nactivities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not\nconsolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these\npartnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through\nthe receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss\nexposure, represented by equity investments and funding\ncommitments, was $30.2 billion and $26.8 billion, of which $10.6\nbillion and $9.4 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of\nloss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the\nproject qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information\non affordable housing tax credits and Note 28 for more information on\noff-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)\nThe Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,\nincluding remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In\ncertain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has\nentered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In\nthose transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has\nrecourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm\ndoes not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential\nlosses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not\nconsolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the\npower to make decisions that significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the municipal bond vehicle.\nThe Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer\nTOB trusts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $5.8 billion and $6.8\nbillion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 was $8.2 billion and $10.5 billion\nrespectively.Loan securitizations\nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including\nresidential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages\nand other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization\ntransactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity\nfor the Firm.\nFor loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to\nconsolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan\nreceivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting\ncriteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are\nlegally isolated from the Firm\u2019s creditors; (2) the transferee or\nbeneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred\nfinancial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control\nover the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase\nthe transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the\nability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets).\nFor loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes\na gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds\nreceived (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets\nreceived) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses\non securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.\n252 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4510, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db576bce-732b-465c-a3dd-930b7ed3ccec": {"__data__": {"id_": "db576bce-732b-465c-a3dd-930b7ed3ccec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "255", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c8797115-de99-4298-a2b2-3d4ffe508ad8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "255", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0d9621f3a37ec1dd892a127a209e8ccd1830a24e15b93f23eeefb70ca57a8abb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70b5e8f2-61b6-4579-be2c-0cea88345d83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "254", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d46e19a3faad42103516ad60b7bc69fc257a2726d8f0de471b0f59fa8cb3fa73", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c1388f33-3358-4e48-8ca8-8dd05a0db643", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "839420cc3b91810d1127ed3eeb1155a5d3da001698112a9688e1750a443a962e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2da5f6d6848b79b4d5e3ed52e01f67605bcd6c49ca90c67e238782428b2c34a2", "text": "Securitization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s securitization activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrelated to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at\nthe time of the securitization.\n2022 2021 2020\nYear ended December 31,\n (in millions)Residential\nmortgageCommercial and\notherResidential\nmortgageCommercial and\notherResidential\nmortgageCommercial and\nother\nPrincipal securitized $ 10,218 $ 9,036 $ 23,876 $ 14,917 $ 7,103 $ 6,624 \nAll cash flows during the period:\nProceeds received from loan sales as financial instruments $ 9,783 $ 8,921 $ 24,450 $ 15,044 $ 7,321 $ 6,865 \nServicing fees collected 62 2 153 1 211 1 \nCash flows received on interests 489 285 578 273 801 239 \n(a)Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b)Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c)The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d)Represents prime mortgages.

These cash flows and terminal values,\nwhich are based on the reporting units\u2019 annual budgets and forecasts\nare then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount\nrate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of\nequity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm\u2019s\noverall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset\nPricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each\nreporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty\nassociated with the business or management\u2019s forecasts and\nassumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates\nused for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate\nto the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with\nsimilar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted\naverage cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is\ncompared with the Firm\u2019s overall estimated cost of equity to ensure\nreasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash\nflow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and\ntransaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction\ncomparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall\nreasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise\nconclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that\nnaturally exist between the Firm\u2019s businesses and competitor\ninstitutions.\nThe Firm also takes into consideration a comparison between the\naggregate fair values of the Firm\u2019s reporting units and JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s market capitalization.

The model\nconsiders portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing\nfees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service,\nlate charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors.\nThe Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to\nobservable market data where available, and also considers recent\nmarket activity and actual portfolio experience.\n256 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2111, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00517efe-c4ae-4765-900d-0f0bf982c4c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "00517efe-c4ae-4765-900d-0f0bf982c4c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "259", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "deb4ce79-65aa-4015-959d-9c207f77d6de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "259", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f738e6a719eda2ce2b18a8cb3001039ffc983932a38980bca03a7bb85b3e5550", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb3e7115-7f8a-4811-a594-71ba9371a84b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "258", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "bd5cd5c48d6b0471cb0a964ce0c7e9566cf5398017540eec8bd3fbf47787a924", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "724e07b3-1e2a-47eb-86e7-d818c6036729", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e85dbabf8de0d73af0c390ee4f361933474f3a9d37bc391472b261d4c48793db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3d5463141327b5a4697f18e2eb417f652c004b7de88defd9cbaf293842581837", "text": "The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates,\nincluding their effect on prepayment speeds.

These leases generally have terms of 20 years or\nless, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and\ninclude periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease\nwhen the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options.\nAll leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported\nas a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset.\nNone of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm\u2019s\nability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing\ntransactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these\nleases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments\nbased on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease\ncomponents. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease\ncomponents of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real\nestate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-\nlease components.\nOperating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the\nlease commencement date based on the present value of the future\nminimum lease payments over the lease term.

JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and\nliability method to provide for income taxes on all transactions\nrecorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method\nrequires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax\nconsequences of temporary differences between the carrying\namounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes.\nAccordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary\ndifference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects\nto be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are\nrealized. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s expense for income taxes includes the\ncurrent and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance\nis established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm\nexpects to realize.\nDue to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a\nsubstantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and\nestimates are required to be made.

guarantees, and\nother commitments\nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g.,\ncommitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its\ncustomers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial\ninstruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm\nshould the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm\nbe required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the\ncustomer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms\nof the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual\namount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s view, representative\nof its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements.To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain\nconsumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit\nlosses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note\n13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on\nlending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the\ncontractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-\nrelated financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. The amounts in the table below for\ncredit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent\nthe total available credit for these products. The Firm has not\nexperienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit\nfor these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can\nreduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower\nnotice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In\naddition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower\nis 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs\nwhen there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying\nproperty, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n276 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2297, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6199acf-fb57-43b7-8a43-13e368687c0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6199acf-fb57-43b7-8a43-13e368687c0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "279", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51ddc418-8aab-4e07-a317-95b9acd8b1be", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "279", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "7ee9924cdf41c44715cd9237c236950f1f06d793132963db4ef44e5f143db839", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7991258d-ebc2-4eee-be8c-6cf560c2cfd1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "278", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "08907618b75127c38117e1ef23f3fee290858b70c2fb1e06189df645b1c43461", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c57fbe6b-59e6-4698-b815-ff64faf2f229", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6bd45a2787d2ba515c68706f15514d00b118ab06284ab5a18efe89d6fc46fe3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "725a447238c6dc9cb40d8c87f406fed215b5ad37eb05020c16a4f90fee6279ba", "text": "Off\u2013balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments\nContractual amount Carrying value\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nBy remaining maturity at December 31, \n(in millions)Expires in 1\nyear or lessExpires after \n1 year\nthrough \n 3 yearsExpires after \n3 years\nthrough \n 5 yearsExpires after\n5 years Total Total\nLending-related\nConsumer, excluding credit card:\nResidential Real Estate $ 5,156 $ 3,500 $ 6,542 $ 6,089 $ 21,287 $ 32,996 75 100 \nAuto and other 10,642 1 \u2014 1,588 12,231 12,338 \u2014 2 \nTotal consumer, excluding credit card 15,798 3,501 6,542 7,677 33,518 45,334 75 102 \nCredit card 821,284 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 821,284 730,534 \u2014 \u2014 \nTotal consumer 837,082 3,501 6,542 7,677 854,802 775,868 75 102 \nWholesale:\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit 83,832 132,237 201,921 22,417 440,407 453,467 2,328 2,037 \nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees 13,559 8,272 4,585 1,023 27,439 28,530 408 476 \nOther letters of credit 3,692 343 98 1 4,134 4,448 6 9 \nTotal wholesale 101,083 140,852 206,604 23,441 471,980 486,445 2,742 2,522 \nTotal lending-related $ 938,165 $ 144,353 $ 213,146 $ 31,118 $ 1,326,782 $1,262,313 $2,817 $2,624 \nOther guarantees and commitments\nSecurities lending indemnification agreements and\nguarantees $ 283,386 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 283,386 $ 337,770 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 \nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees 5,082 466 12,632 41,000 59,180 55,730 649 475 \nUnsettled resale and securities borrowed agreements 116,260 715 \u2014 \u2014 116,975 103,681  (2) 1 \nUnsettled repurchase and securities loaned agreements 65,873 534 \u2014 \u2014 66,407 74,263 (7) \u2014 \nLoan sale and securitization-related indemnifications:\nMortgage repurchase liability NA NA NA NA NA NA 76 61 \nLoans sold with recourse NA NA NA NA 820 827 28 19 \nExchange & clearing house guarantees and\ncommitments 191,068 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 191,068 182,701 \u2014 \u2014 \nOther guarantees and commitments 4,856 723 209 2,846 8,634 10,490  53 69 \n(a)Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.\n(b)Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.\n(c)Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.\n(d)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $71 million and $44 million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to\nextend credit;

The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose\nfacilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the\nissuance of a standby letter of credit.\nGuarantees\nU.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a\nguarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the\nobligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a\nguarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to\npay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying\nasset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third\nparty\u2019s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm\nconsiders the following off\u2013balance sheet arrangements to be\nguarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain\nindemnification agreements included within third-party contractual\narrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under\nthe sponsored member repo program.\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the\ninception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed\n(e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of\nthe premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this\nfair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in\ncash (for premiums received),or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable\nrecorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the\ncontract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is\namortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the\nlife of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent\nobligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition\nto, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the\nliability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These\nobligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the\ncarrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception\n(adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related\ncontingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales\nagreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the\nguarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result\nfrom the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is\namortized to income as the Firm\u2019s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or\nwhen the indemnification expires).\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and\nindemnifications are included in the table on page 277.\nFor additional information on the guarantees, see below.\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional\nlending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the\nperformance of a client or customer to a third party under certain\narrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings,\nacquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other\nletters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n2022 2021\nDecember 31,\n (in millions)Standby letters of credit and \n other financial guaranteesOther letters \n of creditStandby letters of credit and \n other financial guaranteesOther letters \n of credit\nInvestment-grade $ 19,205 $ 3,040 $ 19,998 $ 3,087 \nNoninvestment-grade 8,234 1,094 8,532 1,361 \nTotal contractual amount $ 27,439 $ 4,134 $ 28,530 $ 4,448 \nAllowance for lending-related commitments $ 82 $ 6 $ 123 $ 9 \nGuarantee liability 326 \u2014 353 \u2014 \nTotal carrying value $ 408 $ 6 $ 476 $ 9 \nCommitments with collateral $ 15,296 $ 795 $ 14,511 $ 999 \n(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings.

As part of this program, the Firm provides an\nindemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender\nagainst the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To\nminimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm\nobtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value\nexceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the\nborrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that\ncollateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the\nborrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the\nborrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults,\nthe Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement\nsecurities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty\nwith the cash equivalent thereof.\nThe cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the\nclient in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies\nthe client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability\nunder these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market\nvalue exceeding 100% of the principal invested.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees\nThe Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts\ninclude written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets\nupon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified\ndate in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts\nin order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms\nof written put options are typically five years or less.\nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value\ncontracts, commonly referred to as \u201cstable value products\u201d, that\nrequire the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the\nmarket value and the book value of a counterparty\u2019s reference\nportfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book\nvalue and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value\nproducts are transacted in order to allow investors to realize\ninvestment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio.\nThese contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated\nmaturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under\ncertain conditions.\nThe notional value of derivative guarantees generally represents the\nFirm\u2019s maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value\nproducts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of\nthe notional amount.\nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the\nFirm\u2019s view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the\ncontract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering\ninto offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge\nthe market risk related to the derivative guarantees.The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as\nguarantees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(in millions) December 31, 2022December 31,\n2021\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees $ 59,180 $ 55,730 \nStable value contracts with contractually\nlimited exposure 31,820 29,778 \nMaximum exposure of stable value\ncontracts with contractually limited\nexposure 2,063 2,882 \nFair value\nDerivative payables 649 475 \nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a\nguarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection\nin the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further\ndiscussion of credit derivatives.\nUnsettled securities financing agreements\nIn the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and\nsecurities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments\nresult in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral\nfrom the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase and\nsecurities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments\nresult in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities\ncollateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date.\nThese agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative,\nand therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets\nuntil settlement date.

Losses on\nrecourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales\nproceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the\nsum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the\nloan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property.\nThe Firm\u2019s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby\neffectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser\nof the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust.

The\nterms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the\nsecurities if such additional amounts are payable.

It is difficult to estimate the\nFirm\u2019s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements,\nsince this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law\nand future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet\noccurred.

If a\ndispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, the Firm will (through the\ncardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the\ncardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the\nFirm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder.\nThe Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements,\nretaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In\naddition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the\npayment or performance risk related to charge-backs.For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm\nprocessed an aggregate volume of $2,158.4 billion, $1,886.7 billion,\nand $1,597.3 billion, respectively.\nClearing Services \u2013 Client Credit Risk\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into\nsecurities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs,\nincluding ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared\nderivative contracts.

Membership in some of these\norganizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses\nincurred by the organization as a result of the default of another\nmember. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These\nobligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount)\nof the Firm\u2019s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a\nclearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to\ncover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these\nobligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses\nafter applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing\nhouses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of\nlosses that may result from the clearing house\u2019s investment of\nguarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and\nindependent of the default of another member. Generally a payment\nwould only be required should such losses exceed the resources of\nthe clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to\nabsorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to\nestimate the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure under these\nmembership agreements, since this would require an assessment of\nfuture claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet\noccurred. However, based on historical experience, management\nexpects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote.

The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and\nfull payment and performance of its sponsored member clients\u2019\nrespective obligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm minimizes its\nliability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the\ncash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the\nclearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be\nremote. The Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange &\nclearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 277.

The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance\nsheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not\nrecognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm\nbelieves that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments\nby the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote.\nThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and\nstructured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase\nFinancial Company LLC (\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a 100%-owned finance\nsubsidiary.

The litigations range from individual\nactions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with\npotentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory\nenforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by\nboth governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These\nlegal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or\ninvestigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and\nseveral geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common\nlaw tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and\nconsumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal\ntheories.\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal\nproceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.2 billion at December 31,\n2022. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses\nwas based upon information available as of that date for those\nproceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably\npossible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not\nbelieve that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The\nFirm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses\ninvolves significant judgment, given:\n\u2022the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings,\nincluding the fact that many are in preliminary stages,\n\u2022the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants,\nincluding the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be\ndetermined,\n\u2022the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings,\nincluding issues regarding class certification and the scope of\nmany of the claims, and\n\u2022the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such\nproceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions\nconcerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about\nthe behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory\nauthorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result\nwhich the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the\nFirm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote.\nAccordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may\nvary significantly.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal\nproceedings.\n1MDB Litigation.

The Firm previously\nreported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its\nforeign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls\nrelated to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the\nFirm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The\nDepartment of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit\nthe Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified\nProfessional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) through the ten-year\ndisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining\nFX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition\nCommission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa\nCompetition Tribunal.\nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York granted\nfinal approval to the Firm\u2019s settlement of a consolidated class action\nbrought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of\nfederal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate\nforeign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of\npersons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures.\nAlthough certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the\nCourt to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their\nclaims was reached in December 2022. A putative class action\nremains pending against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers\non behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at\nallegedly inflated rates. In addition, some FX-related individual and\nputative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct\nhave been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the\nNetherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the\nUK actions was reached in December 2022. In a putative class action\npending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, proposed class\nrepresentatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for\nclass certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in\nprinciple has been reached in the putative class action, which remains\nsubject to court approval.\nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations\nfiled a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and\nMastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of\ncredit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in\nviolation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the\ncases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed onappeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York.\nThe original class action was divided into two separate actions, one\nseeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily\ninjunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class\naction finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the\nprior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the\ndefendants collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the\napproximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original\nsettlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement\nwas approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based\non the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class\nsettlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the\nsettlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The\ninjunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021,\nthe District Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in\npart, and denied the motion in part.\nOf the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class\nsettlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar\nallegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm\nand other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the\ndefendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted\nout representing over half of the combined Mastercard-branded and\nVisa-branded payment card sales volume.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4760, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39ebbac2-8454-4a69-a57f-e55d21dc4dda": {"__data__": {"id_": "39ebbac2-8454-4a69-a57f-e55d21dc4dda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "286", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c256eb7-a92e-41c5-8312-f0bea25baa13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "286", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0286a02861fda935bf6761bb905f659a9ebe02026287bdee6f02e9f354111287", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "af37ee29-9da6-488c-b3b2-d234da3b65d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "286", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "eddb6b34ce572ed22ab4c5d9c2da7a9473e13983b5a1d75770304a06b47b9f11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bfea63dd-f9d4-453b-82b0-81788a61b11b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1df1a5aa98e0688c4e7cbf6339f5513f85832c6a8e8269e4b2362af33af99f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "21f4b1dfccfe26809c67eab16ced1aec03e1fd48f8f4b193267951ae4078d91e", "text": "Certain merchants appealed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s approval order, and those appeals are pending.

In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a\nlawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other\ndefendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar\nLIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based\nconsumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court\ndismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an\namended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which\ndefendants have moved to dismiss. The Firm\u2019s settlements of putative\nclass actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the\nSingapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap\nReference Rate received final court approval in November 2022,\nwhile the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to\ncourt approval.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation.

These estimates\nand assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the\nFirm\u2019s segment reporting as set forth in Note 32.\nThe Firm\u2019s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not\nconsidered by management to be significant in relation to total assets.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s long-lived assets are located in the U.S.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31, \n (in millions) Revenue ExpenseIncome before\nincome tax \n expense Net income Total assets\n2022\nEurope/Middle East/Africa $ 18,765 $ 11,754 $ 7,011 $ 5,158 $ 558,430 \nAsia-Pacific 10,025 6,763 3,262 2,119 281,479 \nLatin America/Caribbean 3,178 1,697 1,481 1,156 78,673 \nTotal international 31,968 20,214 11,754 8,433 918,582 \nNorth America 96,727 62,315 34,412 29,243 2,747,161 \nTotal $ 128,695 $ 82,529 $ 46,166 $ 37,676 $ 3,665,743 \n2021\nEurope/Middle East/Africa $ 16,561 $ 10,833 $ 5,728 $ 4,202 $ 517,904 \nAsia-Pacific 9,654 6,372 3,282 2,300 277,897 \nLatin America/Caribbean 2,756 1,589 1,167 878 65,040 \nTotal international 28,971 18,794 10,177 7,380 860,841 \nNorth America 92,678 43,293 49,385 40,954 2,882,726 \nTotal $ 121,649 $ 62,087 $ 59,562 $ 48,334 $ 3,743,567 \n2020\nEurope/Middle East/Africa $ 16,566 $ 10,987 $ 5,579 $ 3,868 $ 530,687 \nAsia-Pacific 9,289 5,558 3,731 2,630 252,553 \nLatin America/Caribbean 2,740 1,590 1,150 837 63,853 \nTotal international 28,595 18,135 10,460 7,335 847,093 \nNorth America 91,356 66,001 25,355 21,796 2,537,664 \nTotal $ 119,951 $ 84,136 $ 35,815 $ 29,131 $ 3,384,757 \n(a)Substantially reflects the U.S.\n(b)Revenue is composed of net interest income and noninterest revenue.\n(c)Expense is composed of noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses.\n(d)Total assets for the U.K. were approximately $357 billion, $365 billion and $353 billion at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(e)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.(b) (c)\n(d)\n(a)\n(d)\n(e)\n(a) (e)\n(d)\n(e)\n(a) (e)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K 287", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2789, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34d77f98-3efe-4074-a548-d6c6d038311e": {"__data__": {"id_": "34d77f98-3efe-4074-a548-d6c6d038311e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "290", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a579007f-ae0e-4b5a-8210-f6231886a18e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "290", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e5fcf14a40b5c89a2fd1eec21ad61e83f1e5509c727aae8601777c3f861b50b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec81d9af-f2d7-46d6-b189-f40e36904f4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "289", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2874a722c238189ac1e834381e7139e3ce547381191991e0c7cf2f56c5be92ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "243af2cf-ae93-47e8-9ed4-f08926bb3bd2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad1731812c73fa59fe8ff65a12202004ea7940a3955e051948d086193dfaee8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ce31b6a241216b5e4cbcffca025c15d20c6f4e571a0322a5626d7d257149e89d", "text": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 32 \u2013 Business segments\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis.

between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using\nannual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 292-296 for\nmore information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to\nvolume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products\nwithin each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between\ncategories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes\nin the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise\nallocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.\n2022 versus 2021 2021 versus 2020\n(Unaudited)Increase/(decrease) due to\nchange in:Increase/(decrease) due to\nchange

Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or\nmore of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;\n(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-\nincome ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the\nFirm\u2019s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide\ncomplete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source\nof his or her income.\nOption ARMs\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate\nmortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month\nto make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest\nrate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is\nusually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed\nrate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the\nintroductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect\nmovements in the index. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any\nunpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the\nloan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which\nconverts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting\nspecified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.\nPrime\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records\nwho meet specific underwritingrequirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income\nand overall debt levels.

Each of those deposit\nagreements has been filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed in connection with the issuance of the depositary shares representing\neach series of the Listed Preferred Stock.\nGeneral. Each depositary share represents a 1/400 interest in a share of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, and is evidenced by\ndepositary receipts. In connection with the issuance of each series of Listed Preferred Stock, we deposited shares of that series of Listed Preferred\nStock with Computershare Inc., as depositary under the deposit agreement relating to that series of Listed Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms of\neach deposit agreement, the depositary shares are entitled to all the powers, preferences and special rights of the relevant series of Listed\nPreferred Stock, as applicable, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Listed Preferred Stock those depositary shares represent.\nDividends and Other Distributions. Each dividend payable on a depositary share will be in an amount equal to 1/400 of the dividend declared and\npayable on the related share of the Listed Preferred Stock.\nThe depositary will distribute all dividends and other cash distributions received on the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock to the holders of\nrecord of the related depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by each holder. In the event of a distribution other\nthan in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the holders of record of the depositary receipts as nearly as practicable in\nproportion to the number of depositary shares held by each holder, unless the depositary determines that this distribution is not feasible, in which\ncase the depositary may, with our approval, adopt a method of distribution that it deems practicable, including the sale of the property and\ndistribution of the net proceeds of that sale to the holders of the depositary receipts.\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates\nfor the related shares of Listed Preferred Stock.\nThe amount paid as dividends or otherwise distributable by the depositary with respect to the depositary shares or the underlying Listed Preferred\nStock will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by us or the depositary on account of taxes or other governmental charges.\nRedemption of Depositary Shares. If we redeem a series of Listed Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, the corresponding\ndepositary shares also will be redeemed with the proceeds received by the depositary from the redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock held by the\ndepositary.

The Index measures the composite performance of energy-oriented Master\nLimited Partnerships, or MLPs, and is calculated and maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Calculation Agent\u201d), in consultation\nwith GKD Index Partners, LLC (the \u201cIndex Sponsor\u201d), using a float-adjusted, market capitalization methodology. MLPs are limited partnerships\nprimarily engaged in the exploration, marketing, mining, processing, production, refining, storage, or transportation of any mineral or natural\nresource.\nDenominations\nThe Alerian ETNs are denominated in U.S. dollars in minimum denominations equal to the $19.03661 per note (the \u201cPrincipal Amount\u201d), which is the\namount equal to the Initial VWAP Level (defined below), divided by ten.\nCoupon Payments and the Accrued Tracking Fee\nFor each Alerian ETN a holder holds on the applicable Coupon Record Date, holders will receive on each Coupon Payment Date the \u201cCoupon\nAmount,\u201d which is an amount in cash equal to the difference between (a) the Reference Distribution Amount (defined below), calculated as of the\ncorresponding Coupon Valuation Date and (b) the Accrued Tracking Fee (defined below), calculated as of the corresponding Coupon Valuation\nDate.\nThe Accrued Tracking Fee accrues on a daily basis at a rate of 0.85% per annum, applied to the Daily Note Value as of the Index Business Day\nimmediately preceding the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date. The Daily Note Value reflects the cumulative performance of the VWAP Level of\nthe Index since April 1, 2009, which we refer to as the Inception Date. If the Daily Note Value increases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will increase, and\nif the Daily Note Value decreases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will decrease. The Daily Note Value is published on the Bloomberg Professional\nservice (\u201cBloomberg\u201d) under the ticker symbol \u201cAMJIVWAP\u201d and on Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol \u201cAMJIVWAP:IND.\u201d\nOn any Index Business Day, the VWAP Level reflects the weighted VWAPs of the Index Components, and the VWAP of each Index Component is\nthe volume-weighted average price of one share of that Index Component as determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent based on the Primary\nExchange for that Index Component.\nTo the extent the Reference Distribution Amount on any Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the corresponding\nCoupon Valuation Date, there will be no coupon payment made on the corresponding Coupon Payment Date, and an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the Accrued Tracking Fee and the Reference Distribution Amount (the \u201cTracking Fee Shortfall\u201d) will be included in the Accrued Tracking\nFee for the next Coupon Valuation Date. This will be in addition to the accrual at a rate of 0.85% per annum over the quarter that has elapsed since\nthe previous date of determination. This process will be repeated to the extent necessary until the Reference Distribution Amount for a Coupon\nValuation Date is greater than the Accrued Tracking Fee for the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date (which includes the accumulated Tracking\nFee Shortfall from all prior quarters).

Where appropriate, we use parentheses to\nrefer you to the particular sections of the 2016 Indenture. Any reference to particular sections or defined terms of the 2016 Indenture in any\nstatement under this heading qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition into that statement.\nThe debt securities will be the Issuer\u2019s direct, unsecured general obligations, the payment on which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the\nGuarantor, and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of the Issuer\u2019s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.\nThe Guarantor is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries. As a result, claims of the holders of the\ndebt securities against the Guarantor under the guarantee will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of the Guarantor\u2019s subsidiaries,\nexcept to the extent that the Guarantor may be recognized, and receives payment, as a creditor of those subsidiaries. Claims of the Guarantor\u2019s\nsubsidiaries\u2019 creditors other than the Guarantor include substantial amounts of long-term debt, deposit liabilities, federal funds purchased, securities\nloaned or sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.\nEvents of Default and Waivers\nAn \u201cEvent of Default\u201d with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2016 Indenture is defined in the 2016 Indenture as:\na.default in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series and continuance of such default for 30 days;\nb.default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at maturity, upon redemption,\nby declaration, or otherwise;\nc.default in the performance, or breach, of any other covenants or warranties applicable to the Issuer contained in the 2016 Indenture\napplicable to that series, and continuation of such default or breach for 90 days after written notice has been", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4775, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c692d18-37e9-463e-a445-75fcc2c9a278": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c692d18-37e9-463e-a445-75fcc2c9a278", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "328", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "acbdc870-2642-454a-bcb1-a2f6c2ccf52b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "328", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5221c2eee136c137ec08352d08f9f45ede54742ee2f676314f151a4f0262d339", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "95fb5fec-2225-4121-82b9-9752a64c77a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "327", "file_name": "JPMC2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\JPMC\\JPMC2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9015159, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "80c8732887ef1d8ea4c7597ed4730cc741bd0fabf814ab632eff3728160457a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a25fec19-499c-497e-b627-1a36fd096fc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2a69e52ff506736d72158348c0ba4376f51638bacb5491d5706080764dc2e2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2cd9fc82406f3ffb8b81c1c6d1ff66aa7c47d0385f8399f3a9de29795a9a4c05", "text": "given by the Trustee to the Issuer and the Guarantor or given by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding\nsecurities of all series affected thereby to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee;\nd.certain events of the Issuer\u2019s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or involuntary;\ne.the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the 2016 Indenture, or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms\nits obligations under the guarantee, provided that no Event of Default with respect to the guarantee will occur as a result of, or because it is\nrelated directly or indirectly to, the insolvency of the Guarantor or the commencement of proceedings under Title 11 of the United States\nCode, or the appointment of a receiver for the Guarantor under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nof 2010, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation having separately repudiated the Guarantee in receivership, or the commencement\nof or certain other events of the Guarantor\u2019s bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation; or\nf.any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of security.

(Sections 5.01 and 5.10)\nEvents of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not constitute an Event of Default\nwith respect to any series of debt securities. In addition, failure by the Guarantor to perform any of its covenants or warranties (other than a payment\ndefault) will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities.

Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect to any of these\nsecurities, the Trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

To the extent the terms of the Award\nAgreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern. The Award Agreement, the\nPlan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this\naward.\nThis award was granted on the Grant Date subject to the Award Agreement and Plan. Unless you decline by the deadline and in the manner\nspecified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.

The number, if any, will be based on the dividends that would have been\npaid during the Vesting Period as of each dividend payment date on the actual number of shares of Common Stock distributable to you resulting\nfrom the vesting of the PSUs, if any, and treated as reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock on each dividend payment based on the Fair\nMarket Value of one share of Common Stock on each dividend payment date (\u201cReinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units\u201d).\nHolding Requirement\nAs of the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, you shall be entitled to be issued a number of shares of the Common Stock of JPMorgan\nChase equal to the number of PSUs, if any, plus any additional Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units, vesting on such date, less the number\nwithheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.

A downward adjustment could result in a Qualitative Performance Factor of between 0% and 99%, depending on the circumstances. During\nthe Performance Period, a 0% Performance Factor for each year in the Performance Period would reduce your Target Award Number of PSUs to\nzero, resulting in the cancellation of award with no shares vesting.\nAdditionally, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such assessment of your qualitative performance based on your performance during\nthe entire three year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire number of PSUs determined under section\ncaptioned \u201cNumber of Performance Share Units at End of the Performance Period\u201d.
