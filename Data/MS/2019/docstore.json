We compete in the U.S. and globally\nfor clients, market share and human talent. Operating within the\nfinancial services industry on a global basis presents, among\nother things, technological, risk management, regulatory and\nother infrastructure challenges that require effective resource\nallocation in order for us to remain competitive. Our competitive\nposition depends on a number of factors, including our\nreputation, the quality and consistency of our long-term\ninvestment performance, innovation, execution and relative\npricing. Our ability to sustain or improve our competitive\nposition also depends substantially on our ability to continue toattract and retain highly qualified employees while managing\ncompensation and other costs. We compete with commercial\nbanks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, exchanges,\nelectronic trading and clearing platforms, financial data\nrepositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds and private\nequity funds, energy companies, financial technology firms and\nother companies offering financial or ancillary services in the\nU.S., globally and digitally, including through the internet. In\naddition, restrictive laws and regulations applicable to certain\nfinancial services institutions, which may prohibit us from\nengaging in certain transactions and impose more stringent\ncapital and liquidity requirements, can put us at a competitive\ndisadvantage to competitors in certain businesses not subject to\nthese same requirements.

Additionally, there is\nincreased competition driven by established firms as well as the\nemergence of new firms and business models (including\ninnovative uses of technology) competing for the same clients\nand assets or offering similar products and services to customers.\nOur ability to access capital at competitive rates (which is\ngenerally impacted by our credit ratings), to commit and to\ndeploy capital efficiently, particularly in our capital-intensive\nunderwriting and sales, trading, financing and market-making\nactivities, also affects our competitive position.

For example the FDIC\nrequires certain insured depository institutions (\u201cIDI\u201d),\nincluding our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, to submit an annual\nresolution plan that describes the IDI\u2019s strategy for a rapid and\norderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or\nfailure of the IDI.\nIn addition, certain financial companies, including BHCs such\nas the Firm and certain of its subsidiaries, can be subjected to a\nresolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority in\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act with the FDIC being appointed\nas receiver, provided that certain procedures are met, including\ncertain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk\ndeterminations by the U.S. Treasury Secretary in consultation\nwith the U.S. President. The orderly liquidation authority\nrulemaking is proceeding in stages, with some regulations now\nfinalized and others not yet proposed. If we were subject to the\norderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would have considerable\npowers, including: the power to remove directors and officers\nresponsible for our failure and to appoint new directors and\nofficers; the power to assign our assets and liabilities to a third\nparty or bridge financial company without the need for creditor\nconsent or prior court review; the ability to differentiate among\nour creditors, including by treating certain creditors within the\nsame class better than others, subject to a minimum recovery\nright on the part of disfavored creditors to receive at least what\nthey would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and broad\npowers to administer the claims process to determine\ndistributions from the assets of the receivership.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4784, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d1dc38a-2353-4927-ab77-3cc4f1d07349": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d1dc38a-2353-4927-ab77-3cc4f1d07349", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1c1f15b-68c6-4f23-8466-e110040281e9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8b82e2ee2a1b511b1ee8e42420bc3f43b31b0604500572c62c496ec6de08831c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "24033751-53b4-4f0c-829c-263a03140a1b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "889196e495566ce713c19ae62a103fce75de6b6503d105231f4cc0efe5cec09c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "37e08efc-a3d6-41ca-a20f-9f5f8a515a25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6bdb87b6a5083689e3960ded5d6d4e4b6e5bec228bdd87459dd828966960c52c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "48b4a008c05a7fc8f6429758227deb86761ffeef1cae6aece90f26c3b046e041", "text": "Treasury Secretary in consultation\nwith the U.S. President.

The CFTC\nis the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of\nthe CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged\nwith the regulation of security-based swaps. The rules and\nregulations of various self-regulatory organizations also govern\nderivatives.\nUnder the U.S. regulatory regime for swaps and security-based\nswaps (collectively, \u201cSwaps\u201d) implemented pursuant to the\nDodd-Frank Act, we are subject to comprehensive regulation of\nour derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose\nmargin requirements, public and regulatory reporting, central\nclearing and mandatory trading on regulated exchanges or\nexecution facilities for certain types of Swaps. \nCFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory\nclearing and execution of interest rate and certain credit default\nswaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to business\nconduct standards for all in-scope Swaps. We also anticipate that\nthe CFTC will adopt capital requirements for swap dealers and\nmajor swap participants that are not subject to the capital rules\nof a prudential regulator. We have registered a number of U.S.\nand non U.S. CFTC swap dealers.\nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-\nbased swap dealers. Though compliance with a number of these\nrules is not expected to be required until 2021, they will trigger\nnumerous obligations for entities that register as security-based\nswap dealers, including capital, margin and segregationrequirements. We anticipate registering one or more entities as\na security-based swap dealer.\nThe specific parameters of some of these requirements for\nSwaps have been and continue to be developed through CFTC,\nSEC and bank regulator rulemakings. For example, the rules for\nvariation margin are presently effective, and those for initial\nmargin will continue to phase-in based on activity levels of the\nswap dealer and the relevant counterparty with the final phase\ncurrently expected to occur in September 2021, subject to\nfinalization of various proposed rule makings by the CFTC and\nbank regulators.

Subsidiaries\nengaged in banking and trust activities and advisory activities\noutside the U.S. are regulated by various government agencies\nin the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered,\nincorporated and/or conduct their business activity. For instance,\nthe PRA, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) and\nseveral securities and futures exchanges in the U.K., including\nthe London Stock Exchange and ICE Futures Europe, regulate\nour activities in the U.K.; the Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr\nFinanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (the Federal Financial\nSupervisory Authority) and the Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG regulate\ncertain of our activities in the Federal Republic of Germany; the\nEuropean Central Bank supervises certain subsidiaries in our\npost-Brexit structure; the Financial Services Agency, the\nSecurities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, the Bank of\nJapan, the Japan Securities Dealers Association and several\nJapanese securities and futures exchanges and ministries\nregulate our activities in Japan; the Securities and Futures\nCommission of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\nregulate our business in Hong Kong; and the Monetary\nAuthority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange Limited\nregulate our business in Singapore; other similar bodies regulate\nour activities in Ireland, China, Korea, Australia, India and other\ncountries.\nOur largest non-U.S. entity, MSIP, is subject to extensive\nregulation and supervision by the PRA, which has broad legal\nauthority to establish prudential and other standards applicable\nto MSIP that seek to ensure its safety and soundness and to\nminimize adverse effects on the stability of the U.K. financial\nsystem. MSIP is also regulated and supervised by the FCA with\nrespect to business conduct matters.\nNon-U.S. policymakers and regulators, including the European\nCommission and European Supervisory Authorities (among\nothers, the European Banking Authority and the European\nSecurities and Markets Authority), continue to propose and\nadopt numerous reforms, including those that may further\nimpact the structure of banks or subject us to new prudential\nrequirements, and to formulate regulatory standards and\nmeasures that will be of relevance and importance to our\nEuropean operations.\nIn June 2019, the European Commission published a package\nof reforms including various risk reduction measures.

For more\ninformation on how we monitor and manage market risk, see\n\u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk\u2014Market\nRisk.\u201d\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by market\nfluctuations and by global and economic conditions and other\nfactors, including changes in asset values.\nOur results of operations have been in the past and may, in the\nfuture, be materially affected by market fluctuations due to\nglobal financial markets, economic conditions, changes to\nglobal trade policies and tariffs and other factors, including the\nlevel and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity\nprices, the level and term structure of interest rates, inflation and\ncurrency values, and the level of other market indices.\nThe results of our Institutional Securities business segment,\nparticularly results relating to our involvement in primary and\nsecondary markets for all types of financial products, are subject\nto substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that\nwe cannot control or predict with great certainty. These\nfluctuations impact results by causing variations in business\nflows and activity and in the fair value of securities and other\nfinancial products. Fluctuations also occur due to the level of\nglobal market activity, which, among other things, affects the\nsize, number and timing of investment banking client\nassignments and transactions and the realization of returns from\nour principal investments.\nDuring periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions,\nthe level of individual investor participation in the global\nmarkets, as well as the level of client assets, may also decrease,\nwhich would negatively impact the results of our Wealth\nManagement business segment.\nSubstantial market fluctuations could also cause variations in\nthe value of our investments in our funds, the flow of investment\ncapital into or from AUM, and the way customers allocate capital\namong money market, equity, fixed income or other investment\nalternatives, which could negatively impact our Investment\nManagement business segment.The value of our financial instruments may be materially\naffected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may\nmake it extremely difficult to value and monetize certain of our\nfinancial instruments, particularly during periods of market\ndisplacement. Subsequent valuations in future periods, in light\nof factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in\nthe values of these instruments and may adversely impact\nhistorical or prospective fees and performance-based fees (also\nknown as incentive fees, which include carried interest) in\nrespect of certain businesses. In addition, at the time of any sales\nand settlements of these financial instruments, the price we\nultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in\nthe market at that time and may be materially lower than their\ncurrent fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in\nthe value of our financial instruments, which may have an\nadverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.\nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events\nevidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by\na reduction in asset liquidity. Under these extreme conditions,\nhedging and other risk management strategies may not be as\neffective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under\nmore normal market conditions. Moreover, under these\nconditions, market participants are particularly exposed to\ntrading strategies employed by many market participants\nsimultaneously and on a large scale. Our risk management and\nmonitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more\nextreme market moves. However, severe market events have\nhistorically been difficult to predict and we could realize\nsignificant losses if extreme market events were to occur.\nHolding large and concentrated positions may expose us to\nlosses.\nConcentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in\nour market-making, investing, underwriting, including block\ntrading, and lending businesses in the event of unfavorable\nmarket movements, or when market conditions are more\nfavorable for our competitors. We commit substantial amounts\nof capital to these businesses, which often results in our taking\nlarge positions in the securities of, or making large loans to, a\nparticular issuer or issuers in a particular industry, country or\nregion.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5077, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d2beb1b-32cc-4b2d-b631-6bc867952e8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d2beb1b-32cc-4b2d-b631-6bc867952e8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7d0baadd-8cea-4125-a8c3-e990a7e2dbfa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2fcac5e4c638e07c50bf554c554774b703a96aa05c3a1caa2124f36399a16dbb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e00ceb4-0030-4dfa-91ed-c82552202f64", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "06470767b00c8dd23b2ea23c00ae393cfff8094cafb6759da4ed5871b6685b24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "87dd43ca-c238-4019-a352-a3de4753559b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9190b74818a12e853f46948bcd28ecd5c86d907841997dc91e6a9bd5a701f89d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "445571f79f92b58ed018b4beee81f00db261e951206e30cb6235a904dac9d317", "text": "Our risk management and\nmonitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more\nextreme market moves.

This risk may arise\nfrom a variety of business activities, including, but not limited\nto: extending credit to clients through various lending\ncommitments; entering into swap or other derivative contracts\nunder which counterparties have obligations to make payments\nto us; providing short- or long-term funding that is secured by\nphysical or financial collateral whose value may at times be\ninsufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount; posting\nmargin and/or collateral and other commitments to clearing\nhouses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms\nand other financial counterparties; and investing and trading in\nsecurities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assets may\nfluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the\nunderlying obligations or loans.\nWe also incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business\nsegment lending to mainly individual investors, including, but\nnot limited to, margin- and securities-based loans collateralized\nby securities, residential mortgage loans and HELOCs.\nOur valuations related to, and reserves for losses on, credit\nexposures rely on complex models, estimates, and subjective\njudgments about the future. While we believe current valuations\nand reserves adequately address our perceived levels of risk,\nfuture economic conditions that differ from or are more severe\nthan forecast, inaccurate models or assumptions, or external\nfactors such as natural disasters, could lead to inaccurate\nmeasurement of or deterioration of credit quality of our\nborrowers and counterparties or the value of collateral and result\nin unexpected losses. In addition, we may incur higher than\nanticipated credit losses in periods of market illiquidity or as a\nresult of disputes with counterparties over the valuation of\ncollateral during periods of economic stress.\nCertain of our credit exposures are concentrated by product,\nindustry or country. Although our models and estimates account\nfor correlations among related types of exposures, a change in\nthe market environment for a concentrated product or an external\nfactor impacting a concentrated industry or country may result\nin credit losses in excess of amounts forecast. Concentrations\nof credit risk are managed through the Firm\u2019s comprehensive\nand global Credit Limits Framework. \nIn addition, as a clearing member of several central\ncounterparties, we are responsible for the defaults or misconduct\nof our customers and could incur financial losses in the event\nof default by other clearing members. Although we regularly\nreview our credit exposures, default risk may arise from events\nor circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.A default by a large financial institution could adversely affect\nfinancial markets.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may\nbe closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or\nother relationships among the institutions. Increased\ncentralization of trading activities through particular clearing\nhouses, central agents or exchanges as required by provisions\nof the Dodd-Frank Act may increase our concentration of risk\nwith respect to these entities. As a result, concerns about, or a\ndefault or threatened default by, one institution could lead to\nsignificant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or\ndefaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as\nsystemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries,\nsuch as clearing houses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks\nand securities firms, with which we interact on a daily basis and,\ntherefore, could adversely affect us.

The\nFunding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity,\nas applicable, to our material entities.\nThe obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC\nunder the amended and restated support agreement are in most\ncases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent\nCompany (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent\nCompany and certain other assets), and the assets of the Funding\nIHC. As a result, claims of our material entities, including the\nFunding IHC, against the assets of the Parent Company with\nrespect to such secured assets are effectively senior to unsecured\nobligations of the Parent Company.\nAlthough an SPOE strategy, whether applied pursuant to our\nresolution plan or in a resolution proceeding under the orderly\nliquidation authority, is intended to result in better outcomes for\ncreditors overall, there is no guarantee that the application of an\nSPOE strategy, including the provision of support to the Parent\nCompany\u2019s material entities pursuant to the secured amended\nand restated support agreement, will not result in greater losses\nfor holders of our securities compared to a different resolution\nstrategy for us.\nRegulators have taken and proposed various actions to facilitate\nan SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly\nliquidation authority and other resolution regimes. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve requires top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs,\nincluding the Firm, to maintain minimum amounts of equity and\neligible long-term debt TLAC in order to ensure that such\ninstitutions have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point\nof failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of debt to\nequity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible TLAC where\nthe SPOE strategy is used. The combined implication of the\nSPOE resolution strategy and the TLAC requirement is that our\nlosses will be imposed on the holders of eligible long-term debt\nand other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company\nbefore any losses are imposed on the holders of the debt\nsecurities of our operating subsidiaries or before putting U.S.\ntaxpayers at risk.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and other\nE.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, or are in the process of\nimplementing, changes to resolution regimes to provide\nresolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing\nentity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain\nunsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities\ninto equity. Such \u201cbail-in\u201d powers are intended to enable the\nrecapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its\nshareholders and unsecured creditors. Non-U.S. regulators are\nalso considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of large\nfinancial institutions maintain minimum amounts of TLAC that\nwould pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the Parent\nCompany and, ultimately, to security holders of the Parent\nCompany in the event of failure.We may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other\ncapital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised\nregulatory capital standards.\nWe are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision,\nregulation and examination by the Federal Reserve, which\nrequires us to submit, on an annual basis, a capital plan\ndescribing proposed dividend payments to shareholders,\nproposed repurchases of our outstanding securities and other\nproposed capital actions that we intend to take. The Federal\nReserve may object to, or otherwise require us to modify, such\nplan, or may object or require modifications to a resubmitted\ncapital plan, any of which would adversely affect shareholders.\nIn addition, beyond review of the plan, the Federal Reserve may\nimpose other restrictions or conditions on us that prevent us from\npaying or increasing dividends, repurchasing securities or taking\nother capital actions that would benefit shareholders.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve may change regulatory capital\nstandards to impose higher requirements that restrict our ability\nto take capital actions or may modify or impose other regulatory\nstandards that increase our operating expenses and reduce our\nability to take capital actions.\nThe financial services industry faces substantial litigation and\nis subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement\ninvestigations, and we may face damage to our reputation and\nlegal liability.\nAs a global financial services firm, we face the risk of\ninvestigations and proceedings by governmental and self-\nregulatory organizations in all countries in which we conduct\nour business.

For example, our status\nas a BHC supervised by the Federal Reserve subjects us to direct\nFederal Reserve scrutiny with respect to transactions between\nour U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and their affiliates. Further, the\nV olcker Rule subjects us to regulatory scrutiny regarding certain\ntransactions between us and our clients.\nRisk Management\nOur risk management strategies, models and processes may\nnot be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all\nmarket environments or against all types of risk, which could\nresult in unexpected losses.\nWe have devoted significant resources to develop our risk\nmanagement capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the\nfuture. Nonetheless, our risk management strategies, models and\nprocesses, including our use of various risk models for assessing\nmarket exposures and hedging strategies, stress testing and other\nanalysis, may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk\nexposure in all market environments or against all types of risk,\nincluding risks that are unidentified or unanticipated.\nAs our businesses change and grow, and the markets in which\nwe operate evolve, our risk management strategies, models and\nprocesses may not always adapt with those changes. Some of\nour methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed\nhistorical market behavior and management\u2019s judgment. As a\nresult, these methods may not predict future risk exposures,\nwhich could be significantly greater than the historical measures\nindicate.\nIn addition, many models we use are based on assumptions or\ninputs regarding correlations among prices of various asset\nclasses or other market indicators and therefore cannot\nanticipate sudden, unanticipated or unidentified market or\neconomic movements, which could cause us to incur losses.\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity, operational, model,\nlegal, regulatory and compliance risks requires, among other\nthings, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a\nlarge number of transactions and events, and these policies and\nprocedures may not be fully effective. Our trading risk\nmanagement strategies and techniques also seek to balance our\nability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to\npotential losses.\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring\nand risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the\njudgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate\nevery economic and financial outcome or the timing of suchoutcomes. For example, to the extent that our trading or investing\nactivities involve less liquid trading markets or are otherwise\nsubject to restrictions on sales or hedging, we may not be able\nto reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated\nwith such positions. We may, therefore, incur losses in the course\nof our trading or investing activities.

Certain\ninvestments are subject to sale restrictions. Typically, there are\nno fee revenues from these investments.\nWithin the Investment Management business segment,\nInvestments revenues, in addition to gains and losses from\ninvestments, include performance-based fees in the form of\ncarried interest, a portion of which is subject to reversal. The\nbusiness is entitled to receive carried interest when the return in\ncertain funds exceeds specified performance targets.\nAdditionally, there are certain sponsored Investment\nManagement funds consolidated by us where revenues are\nprimarily attributable to holders of noncontrolling interests. \nCommissions and Fees\u00a0\nCommissions and fees result from arrangements in which the\nclient is charged a fee for executing transactions related to\nsecurities, services related to sales and trading activities, and\nsales of other products. \nWithin the Institutional Securities business segment,\ncommissions and fees include fees earned from trading\nactivities, such as executing and clearing client transactions on\nmajor stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC\nderivatives. \nWithin the Wealth Management business segment, commissions\nand fees primarily arise from client transactions in equity\nsecurities, insurance products, mutual funds, futures and\noptions. \nAsset Management\u00a0\nAsset management revenues include fees associated with the\nmanagement and supervision of assets, and the distribution of\nfunds and similar products.\nWithin the Wealth Management business segment, Asset\nmanagement revenues are associated with advisory services and\nmanagement of assets, account service and administration, as\nwell as distribution of products. These revenues are generally\nbased on the net asset value of the account in which a client is\ninvested. \nWithin the Investment Management business segment, Asset\nmanagement revenues are primarily composed of fees received\nfrom mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly\nor quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance-\nbased fees, not in the form of carried interest, are earned on\ncertain products and separately managed accounts as a\npercentage of appreciation generally earned by those products\nand, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement ofperformance criteria. These performance fees are generally\nrecognized annually.\nNet Interest\nInterest income and Interest expense are functions of the level\nand mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets\nand Trading liabilities, Investment securities (which include\nAFS and HTM securities), Securities borrowed or purchased\nunder agreements to resell, Securities loaned or sold under\nagreements to repurchase, Loans, Deposits and Borrowings. \nWithin the Institutional Securities business segment, Net interest\nis a function of market-making strategies, customer activity in\nthe prime brokerage business, and the prevailing level, term\nstructure and volatility of interest rates. Net interest is impacted\nby market-making activities as securities held by the Firm earn\ninterest, while securities that are loaned, borrowed, sold with\nagreements to repurchase and purchased with agreements to\nresell incur interest expense. \nWithin the Wealth Management business segment, Interest\nincome is driven by Investment securities, Loans and margin\nloans. Interest expense is driven by Deposits and other funding.\nOther\nOther revenues for Institutional Securities include revenues and\nlosses from equity method investments, lending commitments,\nfees earned in association with lending activities and the\nprovision for loan losses.\nOther revenues for Wealth Management are derived from\nrealized gains and losses on AFS securities, the provision for\nloan losses, account handling fees, referral fees and other\nmiscellaneous revenues.\nInstitutional Securities\u2014Sales and Trading Revenues\nSales and trading net revenues are composed of Trading\nrevenues, Commissions and fees, Asset management revenues\nand Net interest. These revenues, which can be impacted by a\nvariety of interrelated market factors, including volumes, bid-\noffer spreads and inventory prices, as well as the impact of\nhedging activity, are viewed in the aggregate when assessing\nthe performance and profitability of our sales and trading\nactivities.

Fees for providing\nfund administration services are reflected in Asset management\nrevenues.\nEquity\u2014Execution services.  A significant portion of the results\nfor this business is generated by commissions and fees from\nexecuting and clearing client transactions on major stock and\nderivative exchanges, as well as from OTC transactions.

We make markets for our clients in\ninterest rate, foreign exchange and emerging market products,\nincluding exchange-traded and OTC securities and derivative\ninstruments. The results of this market-making activity are\nprimarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling\npositions to stand ready for and satisfy client demand and are\nrecorded in Trading revenues.\n\u2022Credit products.  We make markets in credit-sensitive\nproducts, such as corporate bonds and mortgage securities and\nother securitized products, and related derivative instruments.\nThe values of positions in this business are sensitive to\nchanges in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in\ngains and losses reflected in Trading revenues. We undertake\nlending activities, which include commercial mortgage\nlending, asset-backed lending and financing extended to\ncustomers. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing\nsecurities and loans making up this business, a significant\nportion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues.\n\u2022Commodities products and Other.  We make markets in various\ncommodity products related primarily to electricity, natural\ngas, oil and metals.

For certain revenue-producing employees in the\nWealth Management and Investment Management business\nsegments, compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic\npayouts that link employee compensation to revenues.\nCompensation for other employees, including revenue-\nproducing employees in the Institutional Securities business\nsegment, include base salary and benefits, and may also include\nincentive compensation that is determined following the\nassessment of the Firm\u2019s, business unit\u2019s and individual\u2019s\nperformance. \nCompensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation\nplans is recognized over the relevant vesting period and is\nadjusted based on the notional earnings of the referenced\ninvestments until distribution. Although changes in\ncompensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value\nof the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes\nin the fair value of investments made by the Firm, there is\ntypically a timing difference between the immediate recognition\nof gains and losses on the Firm's investments and the\ncompensation expense recognized over the vesting period.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision for our business segments is generally\ndetermined based on the revenues, expenses and activities\ndirectly attributable to each business segment.\u00a0Certain items\nhave been allocated to each business segment, generally in\nproportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant\nmeasures.Table of Contents\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n31 December 2019 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5178, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cd451c0-29a0-4406-a167-23efd668641b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cd451c0-29a0-4406-a167-23efd668641b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84f66aa8-3620-49bd-a901-9780e5cea035", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2b82aad6831c7ac05d200bb621e45887ec7732dedd7a19236879b6011576ae63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b0488a0-ecd7-4ba5-9814-232486c7c77d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "59c070fd6bf11761da3a93da6fe7961724f3ec4366f9a831b2439106ae6db685", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9bd765e4-504b-41ad-a305-6eb5c9550f34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1485b9e01324795d41bc26f63a8bdd1bf645e7772ad5d9a4f7dae486f63fa407", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "568d8a1f0ac855d6ce6ef4fd0cc917801b19a7e3dc94067616523e935e066866", "text": "Institutional Securities\nIncome Statement Information\n% Change\n$ in millions 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018\nRevenues\nInvestment banking $5,734 $6,088 $5,537 (6)% 10%\nTrading 10,318 11,191 10,295 (8)% 9%\nInvestments 325 182 368 79% (51)%\nCommissions and fees 2,484 2,671 2,433 (7)% 10%\nAsset management 413 421 359 (2)% 17%\nOther 632 535 630 18% (15)%\nTotal non-interest\nrevenues 19,906 21,088 19,622 (6)% 7%\nInterest income 12,193 9,271 5,377 32% 72%\nInterest expense 11,713 9,777 6,186 20% 58%\nNet interest 480 (506) (809)195% 37%\nNet revenues 20,386 20,582 18,813 (1)% 9%\nCompensation and\nbenefits 7,433 6,958 6,625 7% 5%\nNon-compensation\nexpenses 7,463 7,364 6,544 1% 13%\nTotal non-interest\nexpenses 14,896 14,322 13,169 4% 9%\nIncome from continuing \noperations before\nincome taxes 5,490 6,260 5,644 (12)% 11%\nProvision for income\ntaxes 769 1,230 1,993 (37)% (38)%\nIncome from continuing\noperations 4,721 5,030 3,651 (6)% 38%\nIncome (loss) from \ndiscontinued operations, \nnet of income taxes \u2014 (6) (19)100% 68%\nNet income 4,721 5,024 3,632 (6)% 38%\nNet income applicable \nto noncontrolling interests 122 118 96 3% 23%\nNet income applicable \nto Morgan Stanley $4,599 $4,906 $3,536 (6)% 39%Investment Banking\nInvestment Banking Revenues\n% Change\n$\u00a0in\u00a0millions 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018\nAdvisory $2,116 $2,436 $2,077 (13)% 17%\nUnderwriting:\nEquity 1,708 1,726 1,484 (1)% 16%\nFixed Income 1,910 1,926 1,976 (1)% (3)%\nTotal Underwriting 3,618 3,652 3,460 (1)% 6%\nTotal Investment banking $5,734 $6,088 $5,537 (6)% 10%\nInvestment Banking Volumes\n$ in\u00a0billions 2019 2018 2017\nCompleted mergers and acquisitions1$ 818 $1,114 $ 753\nEquity and equity-related offerings2, 361 64 65\nFixed income offerings2, 4270 241 307\nSource: Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters Financial & Risk), data as of January\u00a02,\n2020.

This accounting\nupdate impacts the impairment model for certain financial\nassets measured at amortized cost by requiring a CECL\nmethodology to estimate expected credit losses over the entire\nlife of the financial asset, recorded at inception or purchase.\nCECL replaces the loss model currently applicable to loans\nheld for investment, HTM securities and other receivables\ncarried at amortized cost, such as employee loans.\nThe update also eliminates the concept of other-than-\ntemporary impairment for AFS securities and instead requires\nimpairments on AFS securities to be recognized in earnings\nthrough an allowance when the fair value is less than\namortized cost and a credit loss exists or the securities are\nexpected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost.\nFor certain portfolios, we have determined that there are no\nexpected credit losses; for example, based on collateral\narrangements for lending and financing transactions, such as\nSecurities borrowed, Securities purchased under agreements\nto resell and certain other portfolios. Also, we have a zero loss\nexpectation for certain financial assets based on the credit\nquality of the borrower or issuer, such as U.S. government\nand agency securities.\nAt transition on January 1, 2020, the adoption of this\naccounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance\nfor credit losses of $131 million with a corresponding\nreduction in Retained earnings of $100 million, net of tax.\nThe increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily\nattributable to employee loans, commercial real estate loans\nand securities, and residential real estate loans, partially offset\nby a decrease primarily in secured lending facilities within\ncorporate loans.

We believe that of our\nsignificant accounting policies (see Note 2  to the financial\nstatements), the following policies involve a higher degree of\njudgment and complexity.\nFair Value\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\nA significant number of our financial instruments are carried at\nfair value. We make estimates regarding the valuation of assets\nand liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the financial\nstatements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not\nlimited to:\n\u2022Trading assets and Trading liabilities;\n\u2022Investment Securities\u2014AFS securities;\u2022Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;\n\u2022Certain Deposits, primarily certificates of deposit;\n\u2022Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;\n\u2022Certain Other secured financings; and\n\u2022Certain Borrowings.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability ( i.e., the exit price) in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date.\nIn determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches.\nA hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that\nmaximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring\nthat the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The\nhierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level\u00a01\nrepresents quoted prices in active markets, Level\u00a02 represents\nvaluations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active\nor for which all significant inputs are observable, and Level\u00a03\nconsists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant\nunobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of\njudgment. \nIn periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and\ninputs may be reduced for many instruments, which could cause\nan instrument to be recategorized from Level\u00a01 to Level\u00a02 or\nfrom Level\u00a02 to Level\u00a03. In addition, a downturn in market\nconditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many\ninstruments.

If the fair value of the reporting unit is less\nthan its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal\nto the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited\nby the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting\nunit.\nThe estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based\non valuation techniques we believe market participants would\nuse for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is\ngenerally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow\nmethodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book\nand price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable\ncompanies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date,\neach of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that\nwas substantially in excess of its carrying value.\nIntangible Assets\nAmortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated\nuseful lives and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis\nwhen certain events or circumstances exist. An impairment\nexists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds\nits fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized if the\ncarrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and\nexceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible\nasset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected\nundiscounted cash flows.\nFor both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost\nbasis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is\nnot permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost\nbasis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset.\nAdverse market or economic events could result in impairment\ncharges in future periods.\nSee Notes 2, 3 and 9 to the financial statements for additional\ninformation about goodwill and intangible assets.\nLegal and Regulatory Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we have been named, from\ntime to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including\narbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in\nconnection with our activities as a global diversified financial\nservices institution.Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims\nfor substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims\nfor indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the\nentities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or in financial distress.\nWe are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews,\ninvestigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by\ngovernmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our\nbusiness and involving, among other matters, sales and trading\nactivities, wealth and investment management services,\nfinancial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold\nby us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which\nmay result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties,\ninjunctions or other relief.\nAccruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally\ndetermined on a case-by-case basis. Where available\ninformation indicates that it is probable a liability had been\nincurred at the date of the financial statements and we can\nreasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the\nestimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings,\nhowever, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss\nis probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any\nloss.\nFor certain legal proceedings and investigations, we can\nestimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or\nranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued.

We\nmust make judgments and interpretations about the application\nof these inherently complex tax laws when determining the\nprovision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes\nand must also make estimates about when certain items affect\ntaxable income in the various tax jurisdictions.\nDisputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with\nthe taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically\nevaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction\nresulting from current and subsequent years\u2019 examinations, and\nunrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may\narise from tax audits are established in accordance with the\nrelevant accounting guidance. Once established, unrecognized\ntax benefits are adjusted when there is more information\navailable or when an event occurs requiring a change.\nOur provision for income taxes is composed of current and\ndeferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be\npaid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes\nreflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are\nmeasured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that\nwill be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.\nOur deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets\nrelated to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating\nlosses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of\nfuture tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration\nif not utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews\nto ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These\nreviews include management\u2019s estimates and assumptions\nregarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax\nplanning strategies, including strategies that may be available\nto tax attribute carryforwards before they expire.\nOnce the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we\nmay record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset\nbalances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than\nnot to be realized at a future date. Both current and deferred\nincome taxes may reflect adjustments related to our\nunrecognized tax benefits.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred\ntax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued\ninterest or penalties and uncertain tax positions.

On a regular basis, we review current\nperformance versus established thresholds and assess the need\nto re-allocate the balance sheet based on business unit needs.\nWe also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size\nand capital usage.\nTotal Assets by Business Segment\nAt December 31, 2019\n$ in millions IS WM IM Total\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents1$67,657 $14,247 $ 267 $82,171\nTrading assets at fair value 293,477 47 3,586 297,110\nInvestment securities 38,524 67,201 \u2014 105,725\nSecurities purchased under \nagreements to resell 80,744 7,480 \u2014 88,224\nSecurities borrowed 106,199 350 \u2014 106,549\nCustomer and other \nreceivables 39,743 15,190 713 55,646\nLoans, net of allowance250,557 80,075 5 130,637\nOther assets314,300 13,092 1,975 29,367\nTotal assets $691,201 $197,682 $6,546 $895,429", "start_char_idx": 4102, "end_char_idx": 5509, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c635b2a-347e-4a2e-9982-146604dc1827": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c635b2a-347e-4a2e-9982-146604dc1827", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "acdc9050-8574-4363-a6f5-d1369ef1be1c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8515c9c05f5271c593919b06051a254a3372014ab9ab320e68ff05c77bd18f5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "502cad9f-5021-4bfc-a9df-6e012b3d995f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4242958f7a42bde78f83f010741170529e182f9546e71f84bd453929c46ad540", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad33ab2c-0703-4006-bbc8-dc5ff465a585", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "27c2daf74e32ff0184a6db61759a7671590f2b346bf046758691fdc130a6a0ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8e62d62a6cc17871b314908b7c70376f2e7c3ae264a5d9da9515353107893bfc", "text": "At December 31, 2018\n$ in millions IS WM IM Total\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents1$69,526 $17,621 $ 49$87,196\nTrading assets at fair value 263,870 60 2,369 266,299\nInvestment securities 23,273 68,559 \u2014 91,832\nSecurities purchased under \nagreements to resell 80,660 17,862 \u2014 98,522\nSecurities borrowed 116,207 106 \u2014 116,313\nCustomer and other \nreceivables 35,777 16,865 656 53,298\nLoans, net of allowance243,380 72,194 5 115,579\nOther assets313,734 9,125 1,633 24,492\nTotal assets $646,427 $202,392 $4,712 $853,531\nIS\u2014Institutional Securities\nWM\u2014Wealth Management\nIM\u2014Investment Management\n1.Cash and cash equivalents includes Cash and due from banks, Interest bearing\ndeposits with banks and Restricted cash.\n2.Amounts include loans held for investment (net of allowance) and loans held for sale\nbut exclude loans at fair value, which are included in Trading assets in the balance\nsheets (see Note 8  to the financial statements).\n3.Other assets primarily includes Goodwill and Intangible assets, premises, equipment\nand software, ROU assets related to leases, other investments and deferred tax\nassets.\nA substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable\nsecurities and short-term receivables arising principally from\nsales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities\nbusiness segment.

These increases\nwere partially offset by reduced Securities borrowed resulting\nfrom lower funding requirements. Wealth Management assets\nwere lower primarily due to decreased Securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell as a result of lower deposits in this\nsegment, partially offset by continued Loan growth.\nLiquidity Risk Management Framework\nThe primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management\nFramework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding\nacross a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The\nframework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial\nobligations and support the execution of our business strategies.\nThe following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management\nFramework:\n\u2022Sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover\nmaturing liabilities and other planned and contingent\noutflows;\n\u2022Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned,\nwith limited reliance on short-term funding;\u2022Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding\nshould be diversified; and\n\u2022Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for,\nperiods of limited access to funding.\nThe core components of our Liquidity Risk Management\nFramework that support our target liquidity profile are the\nRequired Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and the\nGLR.\nRequired Liquidity Framework\nOur Required Liquidity Framework establishes the amount of\nliquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments\nto ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are\nnot adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to\nmeet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required\nLiquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity\nrequirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a\nconsolidated and legal entity level.\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nWe use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and\nintercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a\nrange of time horizons. These scenarios contain various\ncombinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of\ndifferent severity and duration.

If adopted, the requirements would apply to us\nand our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, and we expect to be in\ncompliance by the effective date of any final rule.\nFunding Management\nWe manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of\ndisruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of\ndiversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by\nproduct, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor\nof our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period\nof the assets being financed.\nWe fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse\nsources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings,\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities\nlending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have\nactive financing programs for both standard and structured\nproducts targeting global investors and currencies.\nSecured Financing\nThe liquid nature of the marketable securities and short-term\nreceivables arising principally from sales and trading activities\nin the Institutional Securities business segment provides us with\nflexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance\nsheet. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured\nand unsecured financing. Secured financing investors\nprincipally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted.\nAccordingly, we actively manage our secured financings based\non the quality of the assets being funded.\nWe have established longer tenor secured funding requirements\nfor less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in\nthe event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assetsas government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with\na high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that\ndo not meet these criteria. \nTo further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing\nfor less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits\nto diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly\nmaturities for secured financing of less liquid assets.\nFurthermore, we obtain term secured funding liabilities in\nexcess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to\nreplace maturing trades in the event that secured financing\nmarkets, or our ability to access them, become limited. As a\ncomponent of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, we\nhold a portion of our GLR against the potential disruption to our\nsecured financing capabilities.\nWe generally maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable\nsecurities, which takes into account HQLA classifications\nconsistent with LCR definitions, and other regulatory\nrequirements, and provides a valuable future source of liquidity.\nCollateralized Financing Transactions\n$ in millionsAt\nDecember 31,\n2019At\nDecember 31,\n2018\nSecurities purchased under agreements to\nresell and Securities borrowed $ 194,773 $ 214,835\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase and Securities loaned $ 62,706 $ 61,667\nSecurities received as collateral1$ 13,022 $ 7,668\nAverage Daily Balance\nThree Months Ended\n$ in millionsDecember 31,\n2019December 31,\n2018\nSecurities purchased under agreements to\nresell and Securities borrowed $ 210,257 $ 213,974\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase and Securities loaned $ 64,870 $ 57,677\n1.Securities received as collateral are included in Trading assets in the balance sheets.\nSee \"Total Assets by Business Segment\" herein for more details\non the assets shown in the previous table and Notes 2 and 7 to\nthe financial statements for more details on collateralized\nfinancing transactions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4381, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ed98a03-d329-4e16-8f33-37ed80200dd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ed98a03-d329-4e16-8f33-37ed80200dd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e534550e-e00c-4367-b79b-56578e28e4b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "cb0510fce4d8d1562bef299b830019f38bff9c1b365d9b2d09a8b7ba27e5d12e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4eddc0b-d0ff-45a0-897f-09b3fdf76ef6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4257d8bbfebebd7cd843947352f893d6995b8e0c844bcb1e759140c78c21338d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dbb2b167-6c49-4d62-904b-d7335bb48f81", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ceaa0c71f1f05a7c1f0c4031229b331ca0e404ac37a1c8eac1880a41acbb34f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d7e80950e60cf3b17008789fe6c004f835f912143d95da6c64f8ae136cf7c93d", "text": "See \"Total Assets by Business Segment\" herein for more details\non the assets shown in the previous table and Notes 2 and 7 to\nthe financial statements for more details on collateralized\nfinancing transactions.\nIn addition to the collateralized financing transactions shown in\nthe previous table, we engage in financing transactions\ncollateralized by customer-owned securities, which are\nsegregated in accordance with regulatory requirements.\nReceivables under these financing transactions, primarily\nmargin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables\nin the balance sheets, and payables under these financing\ntransactions, primarily to prime brokerage customers, are\nincluded in Customer and other payables in the balance sheets.\nOur risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral\nmaintenance policies.

In addition, the issuance of borrowings with\noriginal maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce\nreliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings\nwith original maturities greater than one year are generally\nmanaged to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating\nrefinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification\nthrough sales to global institutional and retail clients across\nregions, currencies and product types.\nThe availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending\non market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending\nactivities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit.\nWe also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases\nof our borrowings in the ordinary course of business.\nFor further information on Borrowings, see Note 12  to the\nfinancial statements.\nCredit Ratings\nWe rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of\nour daily operations. The cost and availability of financing\ngenerally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other things.\nIn addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain\ntrading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-\nterm counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as\ncertain OTC derivative transactions.

The\nOCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for\nour U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. For us to remain an FHC, we must\nremain well-capitalized in accordance with standards\nestablished by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with\nstandards established by the OCC.

reflects a continued reduction in the\nmagnitude and frequency of internal losses utilized in the\noperational risk capital model related to litigation.\nG-SIB Capital Surcharge\nWe and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to a risk-based capital\nsurcharge. A G-SIB must calculate its G-SIB capital surcharge\nunder two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges.\nThe first method considers the G-SIB\u2019s size,\ninterconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, complexity\nand substitutability, which is generally consistent with the\nmethodology developed by the Basel Committee (\u201cMethod 1\u201d).\nThe second method uses similar inputs but replaces\nsubstitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding\n(\u201cMethod 2\u201d) and generally results in higher surcharges than the\nfirst method. The G-SIB capital surcharge must be satisfied\nusing Common Equity Tier 1 capital and functions as an\nextension of the capital conservation buffer. As of December\u00a031,\n2019 , our fully phased-in G-SIB surcharge is 3%. In 2018, the\nrequirement was based on a phase-in amount of 75% of the\napplicable surcharge (see \u201cRisk-Based Regulatory Capital\u201d\nherein).\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean\nHolding Company Requirements\nThe Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term\ndebt (\u201cLTD\u201d) and clean holding company requirements for top-\ntier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (\u201ccovered BHCs\u201d), including the\nParent Company.

We submitted our 2019 resolution\nplan on June 28, 2019.\nOur preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line\nwith our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred,\nand has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to\nits wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings\nLLC (the \u201cFunding IHC\u201d). In addition, the Parent Company has\nentered into an amended and restated support agreement with\nits material entities (including the Funding IHC) and certain\nother subsidiaries.

The requirement would change from the current\n6% to 3% plus 50% of our current G-SIB capital surcharge, for\na total well-capitalized SLR requirement of 4.5% for our U.S.\nBank Subsidiaries, assuming that our G-SIB capital surcharge\nremains the same when the proposal becomes effective.\nOther Matters\nU.K. Withdrawal from the E.U.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. under\nthe terms of a withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and the\nE.U.

The principal risks\ninvolved in our business activities include market (including\nnon-trading risks), credit, operational, model, compliance,\ncybersecurity, liquidity, strategic, reputational and conduct risk.\nStrategic risk is integrated into our business planning, embedded\nin the evaluation of all principal risks and overseen by the Board.\nThe cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the\npursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk taking that\nprotects our capital base and franchise. This philosophy is\nimplemented through the ERM framework. Five key principles\nunderlie this philosophy: integrity, comprehensiveness,\nindependence, accountability and transparency. To help ensure\nthe efficacy of risk management, which is an essential\ncomponent of our reputation, senior management requiresthorough and frequent communication and the appropriate\nescalation of risk matters. The fast-paced, complex and\nconstantly evolving nature of global financial markets requires\nus to maintain a risk management culture that is incisive,\nknowledgeable about specialized products and markets, and\nsubject to ongoing review and enhancement.\nOur risk appetite defines the types of risk that the Firm is willing\nto accept in pursuit of our strategic objectives and business plan,\ntaking into account the interests of clients and fiduciary duties\nto shareholders, as well as capital and other regulatory\nrequirements. This risk appetite is embedded in our risk culture\nand linked to our short-term and long-term strategic, capital and\nfinancial plans, as well as compensation programs. This risk\nappetite and the related Board-level risk limits and risk tolerance\nstatements are reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee\nof the Board (\u201cBRC\u201d) and the Board on at least an annual basis.\nRisk Governance Structure\nRisk management at the Firm requires independent Firm-level\noversight, accountability of our business divisions, and effective\ncommunication of risk matters across the Firm, to senior\nmanagement and ultimately to the Board. Our risk governance\nstructure is set forth in the following chart and also includes risk\nmanagers, committees, and groups within and across business\nsegments and operating legal entities. The ERM framework,\ncomposed of independent but complementary entities,\nfacilitates efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk\nexposures and processes.\nRRP \u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning\n1.Committees include the Capital Commitment Committee, Global Large Loan Committee, Equity Underwriting Committee, Leveraged Finance Underwriting Committee and Municipal\nCapital Commitment Committee.\n2.Committees include the Securities Risk Committee, Wealth Management Risk Committee and Investment Management Risk Committee.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3570, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e89fe451-4c15-43f6-a699-8c03a9ed4ce9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e89fe451-4c15-43f6-a699-8c03a9ed4ce9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "36e909d4-52c0-407b-9e6f-f1a2847c58d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "af5589163d4addb9f8af17517eb3b27d7a1313a1829bbe3a1ad67c3d19dea34b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "af28e309-e5a1-4d8c-a599-32e8beebda48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "36038b26d4e02f2ba8534fcb2ba9dc54b224b83494b0531c5db2ebf17f6fdbca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d5eb55d-f8c6-421d-af42-94cfddf927ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff0b22d6e1043915fde0dbc659280e9377605c07f01795f79da6a1f251c4bcad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fc0df223905690694055f37da1006ca028711758419a6d3ea233e43fb79807dc", "text": "Morgan Stanley Board of Directors\nThe Board has oversight of the ERM framework and is\nresponsible for helping to ensure that our risks are managed in\na sound manner.

Management\ncommittees from control functions periodically meet to discuss\nemployees whose conduct is not in line with our expectations.\nThese results are incorporated into identified employees\u2019\nperformance reviews and compensation and promotion\ndecisions.\nThe Firm\u2019s clawback and cancellation provisions apply to\ndeferred incentive compensation and cover a broad scope of\nemployee conduct, including any act or omission (including\nwith respect to direct supervisory responsibilities) that\nconstitutes a breach of obligation to the Firm or causes a\nrestatement of the Firm\u2019s financial results, constitutes a violationTable of Contents\nRisk Disclosures\nDecember 2019 Form 10-K 60", "start_char_idx": 4262, "end_char_idx": 5942, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e6990a6-7df0-4977-a57a-4bf126544d14": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e6990a6-7df0-4977-a57a-4bf126544d14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5341e293-e1c2-4b81-a057-5d13ded37e6f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2dbf63b546c72b6a23c94269795253ff0773b4720268065a1e870d0c16742757", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "deb01f16-98ef-427a-a8aa-437d5d5f75bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "01cb3a1f4f3630e335427357dd0eb867b619872d8b7ba38330ce9e14454ece3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "925d2941-57be-4407-824d-b173b76e2f92", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c312f802c4c06aefe20948d6f584dda137499b2cad4da9cf35e85283734ba97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ef3f2ff4f50c40c292c3cb429774da9f8c13774447a9070610a90caa0a5ab555", "text": "of the Firm\u2019s global risk management principles, policies and\nstandards, or causes a loss of revenue associated with a position\non which the employee was paid and the employee operated\noutside of internal control policies.\nRisk Limits Framework\nRisk limits and quantitative metrics provide the basis for\nmonitoring risk taking activity and avoiding outsized risk taking.\nOur risk-taking capacity is sized through the Firm\u2019s capital\nplanning process where losses are estimated under the Firm\u2019s\nBHC Severely Adverse stress testing scenario.

Additional risk limits\napproved by the FRC address more specific types of risk and\nare bound by the higher-level Board risk limits.\nRisk Management Process\nIn subsequent sections, we discuss our risk management policies\nand procedures for our primary risks. This discussion primarily\nfocuses on our Institutional Securities business segment's\ntrading activities and corporate lending and related activities.\nWe believe that these activities generate a substantial portion of\nour primary risks. These sections and the estimated amounts of\nour risk exposure generated by our statistical analyses are\nforward-looking statements. However, the analyses used to\nassess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual\nresults may vary significantly from such analyses due to events\nin the markets in which we operate and certain other factors\ndescribed in the following paragraphs.Table of Contents\nRisk Disclosures\n61 December 2019 Form 10-KMarket Risk\nMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or\nmore market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or\nother market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in\nlosses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market\nrisk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation\nactivities, principally within the Institutional Securities business\nsegment where the substantial majority of our VaR for market\nrisk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non-trading\nmarket risk within the Wealth Management and Investment\nManagement business segments. The Wealth Management\nbusiness segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from\nlending and deposit-taking activities. The Investment\nManagement business segment primarily incurs non-tradingmarket risk from capital investments in alternative and other\nfunds.\nMarket risk includes non-trading interest rate risk. Non-trading\ninterest rate risk in the banking book (amounts classified for\nregulatory capital purposes under the banking book regime)\nrefers to the exposure that a change in interest rates will result\nin prospective earnings changes for assets and liabilities in the\nbanking book.\nSound market risk management is an integral part of our culture.\nThe various business units and trading desks are responsible for\nensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and\nprudent. The control groups help ensure that these risks are\nmeasured and closely monitored and are made transparent to\nsenior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible\nfor ensuring transparency of material market risks, monitoring\ncompliance with established limits and escalating risk\nconcentrations to appropriate senior management.\nTo execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department\nmonitors our risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures,\nperforms a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk\nsummaries, and maintains our VaR and scenario analysis\nsystems. Market risk is also monitored through various\nmeasures: by use of statistics (including VaR and related\nanalytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and\nthrough routine stress testing, which measures the impact on the\nvalue of existing portfolios of specified changes in market\nfactors and scenarios designed by the Market Risk Department\nin collaboration with the business units. The material risks\nidentified by these processes are summarized in reports\nproduced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to\nand discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRC and\nthe Board.\nTrading Risks\nPrimary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk\nManagement\nDuring 2019, we had exposures to a wide range of interest rates,\nequity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices\u2014\nand the associated implied volatilities and spreads\u2014related to\nthe global markets in which we conduct our trading activities.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4977, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "925d2941-57be-4407-824d-b173b76e2f92": {"__data__": {"id_": "925d2941-57be-4407-824d-b173b76e2f92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5341e293-e1c2-4b81-a057-5d13ded37e6f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2dbf63b546c72b6a23c94269795253ff0773b4720268065a1e870d0c16742757", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e6990a6-7df0-4977-a57a-4bf126544d14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ef3f2ff4f50c40c292c3cb429774da9f8c13774447a9070610a90caa0a5ab555", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "34388a4c-7fac-447a-bf79-9cea3a138997", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50005ead1e35e98c22e84798a6acd36d85036125590a137b4610622cdf24b9e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1c312f802c4c06aefe20948d6f584dda137499b2cad4da9cf35e85283734ba97", "text": "Market risk is also monitored through various\nmeasures: by use of statistics (including VaR and related\nanalytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and\nthrough routine stress testing, which measures the impact on the\nvalue of existing portfolios of specified changes in market\nfactors and scenarios designed by the Market Risk Department\nin collaboration with the business units.

Commodity exposures are subject to periods of high\nprice volatility as a result of changes in supply and demand.\nThese changes can be caused by weather conditions; physical\nproduction and transportation; or geopolitical and other events\nthat affect the available supply and level of demand for these\ncommodities.\nWe manage our trading positions by employing a variety of risk\nmitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of\nrisk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the\npurchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial\ninstruments, including a variety of derivative products ( e.g.,\nfutures, forwards, swaps and options). Hedging activities may\nnot always provide effective mitigation against trading losses\ndue to differences in the terms, specific characteristics or other\nbasis risks that may exist between the hedge instrument and the\nrisk exposure that is being hedged.\nWe manage the market risk associated with our trading activities\non a Firmwide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and\non an individual product basis.

Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers,\ntraders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk\nmeasures against limits in accordance with policies set by our\nsenior management.\nValue-at-Risk\nThe statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we\nuse to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures\nof our trading portfolios. The Market Risk Departmentcalculates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to\nvarious levels of management.\nBeginning July 1, 2019, we estimate VaR using a model based\non a one-year equal weighted historical simulation for general\nmarket risk factors and name-specific risk in corporate shares\nand related derivatives, and Monte Carlo simulation for name-\nspecific risk in bonds, loans and related derivatives. The model\nconstructs a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the\nvalue of trading portfolios based on historical observation of\ndaily changes in key market indices or other market risk factors,\nand information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these\nmarket risk factor changes.\nPrior to July 1, 2019, our VaR model used four years of historical\ndata with a volatility adjustment to reflect current market\nconditions. \nVaR for risk management purposes (\u201cManagement VaR\u201d) is\ncomputed at a 95% level of confidence over a one-day time\nhorizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading losses\nresulting from adverse daily market moves. The 95%/one-day\nVaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that,\nbased on historically observed market risk factor movements,\nwould have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times\nin every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for\none day.\nOur VaR model generally takes into account linear and non-\nlinear exposures to equity and commodity price risk, interest\nrate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange rates. The\nmodel also takes into account linear exposures to implied\nvolatility risks for all asset classes and non-linear exposures to\nimplied volatility risks for equity, commodity and foreign\nexchange referenced products. The VaR model also captures\ncertain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio credit\nderivatives, as well as certain basis risks ( e.g., corporate debt\nand related credit derivatives).\nWe use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools.

A small proportion of market risk generated by\ntrading positions is not included in VaR.Table of Contents\nRisk Disclosures\nDecember 2019 Form 10-K 62", "start_char_idx": 4220, "end_char_idx": 5849, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1b153e6-4a22-41dc-baa3-57f2ccfa0501": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1b153e6-4a22-41dc-baa3-57f2ccfa0501", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59251ebb-28f9-45fd-b794-c2a5e5ceee26", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3b69406167a9733183558061938bbe8952bb396796aa391399003160454a50cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e125d859-561a-4998-bae0-efb5e40b6c5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5bfd6f483cdc6911c25d43fa901eaaa075648dcec436dbbde2e773c8656b0e1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bbafc2b2-2c76-4cde-a6ec-1adcf2fb69af", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df62ea27e2e5d6d7004a8d0cb6ffa122478cfdef99b8a55931a75e915504bc2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "828b4062ff15621d323f23c78857cb3afee85bb68cd1dd1b51150b69b9714eec", "text": "The modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies\non approximations that, under certain circumstances, could\nproduce significantly different results from those produced\nusing more precise measures.

CRM approves\nextensions of credit, evaluates the creditworthiness of the\ncounterparties and borrowers on a regular basis, and helps ensure\nthat credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. The\nevaluation of counterparties and borrowers includes an\nassessment of the probability that an obligor will default on its\nfinancial obligations and any losses that may occur when an\nobligor defaults. In addition, credit risk exposure is actively\nmanaged by credit professionals and committees within CRM\nand through various risk committees, whose membership\nincludes individuals from CRM.

The stress tests shock market factors ( e.g.,\ninterest rates, commodity prices, credit spreads), risk parameters\n(e.g., default probabilities and loss given default), recovery rates\nand expected losses in order to assess the impact of stresses on\nexposures, profit and loss, and our capital position. Stress tests\nare conducted in accordance with our established policies and\nprocedures.\nCredit Evaluation\nThe evaluation of corporate and institutional counterparties and\nborrowers includes assigning credit ratings, which reflect an\nassessment of an obligor\u2019s probability of default and loss given\ndefault. Credit evaluations typically involve the assessment of\nfinancial statements; leverage; liquidity; capital strength; asset\ncomposition and quality; market capitalization; access to capital\nmarkets; adequacy of collateral, if applicable; and, in the case\nof certain loans, cash flow projections and debt service\nrequirements. CRM also evaluates strategy, market position,\nindustry dynamics, management and other factors that could\naffect the obligor\u2019s risk profile. Additionally, CRM evaluates\nthe relative position of our exposure in the borrower\u2019s capital\nstructure and relative recovery prospects, as well as other\nstructural elements of the particular transaction.\nThe evaluation of consumer borrowers is tailored to the specific\ntype of lending. Securities-based loans are evaluated based on\nfactors that include, but are not limited to, the amount of the\nloan and the amount, quality, diversification, price volatility and\nliquidity of the collateral. The underwriting of residential real\nestate loans includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor\u2019s\ndebt-to-income ratio, net worth, liquidity, collateral, loan-to-\nvalue ratio and industry standard credit scoring models ( e.g.,\nFICO scores). Subsequent credit monitoring for individual loans\nis performed at the portfolio level, and collateral values are\nmonitored on an ongoing basis.\nCredit risk metrics assigned to our borrowers during the\nevaluation process are incorporated into CRM maintenance of\nthe allowance for loan losses for loans held for investment. Such\nallowance serves as a reserve for probable inherent losses, as\nwell as probable losses related to loans identified as impaired.\nFor more information on the allowance for loan losses, see Notes\n2 and 8 to the financial statements.Risk Mitigation\nWe may seek to mitigate credit risk from our lending and trading\nactivities in multiple ways, including collateral provisions,\nguarantees and hedges. At the transaction level, we seek to\nmitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as\nsize, tenor, financial covenants, seniority and collateral. We\nactively hedge our lending and derivatives exposures. Hedging\nactivities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related\nsecurities and financial instruments, including a variety of\nderivative products ( e.g., futures, forwards, swaps, and options).\nAdditionally, we may sell, assign or syndicate loans and lending\ncommitments to other financial institutions in the primary and\nsecondary loan markets.\nIn connection with our derivatives trading activities, we\ngenerally enter into master netting agreements and collateral\narrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide us\nwith the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate\ncollateral and offset receivables and payables covered under the\nsame master agreement in the event of a counterparty default.\nA collateral management group monitors collateral levels\nagainst requirements and oversees the administration of the\ncollateral function.

The business\ncontinuity management program\u2019s core functions are business\ncontinuity planning and crisis management. As part of business\ncontinuity planning, our business units maintain business\ncontinuity plans, identifying processes and strategies to continue\nbusiness-critical processes during a business continuity event.\nCrisis management is the process of identifying and managing\nour operations during business continuity events. Disaster\nrecovery plans supporting business continuity are in place for\ncritical technology assets and systems across the Firm. \nThird Party Risk Management\nIn connection with our ongoing operations, we utilize the\nservices of third party suppliers, which we anticipate will\ncontinue and may increase in the future.\u00a0These services include,\nfor example, outsourced processing and support functions and\nother professional services.\u00a0Our risk-based approach to\nmanaging exposure to these services includes the performance\nof due diligence, implementation of service level and other\ncontractual agreements, consideration of operational risks and\nongoing monitoring of third-party suppliers\u2019 performance.\u00a0We\nmaintain and continue to enhance our third-party risk\nmanagement program which includes appropriate governance,\npolicies, procedures and technology that supports alignment\nwith our risk tolerance and is designed to meet regulatory\nrequirements.\u00a0The third-party risk management program\nincludes the adoption of appropriate risk management controls\nand practices through the supplier management life cycle,\nincluding, but not limited to, assessment of information security,\nservice failure, financial stability, disaster recoverability,\nreputational risk, contractual risk and safeguards against\ncorruption.\nModel Risk\nModel risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from\ndecisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs.

Liquidity risk also\nencompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our\nfinancial obligations without experiencing significant business\ndisruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability\nas a going concern. Liquidity risk also encompasses the\nassociated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic\nstress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may\nimpact our ability to raise new funding. Generally, we incur\nliquidity and funding risk as a result of our trading, lending,\ninvesting and client facilitation activities.\nOur Liquidity Risk Management Framework is critical to\nhelping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves and\ndurable funding sources to meet our daily obligations and to\nwithstand unanticipated stress events. The Liquidity Risk\nDepartment is a distinct area in Risk Management responsible\nfor the oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk. The Liquidity\nRisk Department ensures transparency of material liquidity and\nfunding risks, compliance with established risk limits and\nescalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior\nmanagement.\nTo execute these responsibilities, the Liquidity Risk Department\nestablishes limits in line with our risk appetite, identifies and\nanalyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to ensure such\nrisks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and reports risk\nexposures against metrics and limits, and reviews the\nmethodologies and assumptions underpinning our Liquidity\nStress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and funding under a\nrange of adverse scenarios. \nThe Treasury Department and applicable business units have\nprimary responsibility for evaluating, monitoring and\ncontrolling the liquidity and funding risks arising from our\nbusiness activities and for maintaining processes and controls\nto manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. The\nLiquidity Risk Department coordinates with the Treasury\nDepartment and these business units to help ensure a consistent\nand comprehensive framework for managing liquidity andfunding risk across the Firm.

Significant Accounting Policies  \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when the promised goods or services\nare delivered to our customers, in an amount that is based on the\nconsideration the Firm expects to receive in exchange for those\ngoods or services when such amounts are not probable of\nsignificant reversal. These policies reflect the adoption of\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers  on January\u00a01, 2018.\nPlease see \u201cAccounting Updates Adopted\u201d herein for the more\nsignificant differences in policies applied in prior periods.\nInvestment Banking\nRevenues from investment banking activities consist of\nrevenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fixed\nincome securities and loan syndications, and advisory fees,\nprimarily for mergers, acquisitions and restructurings. \nUnderwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date\nif there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount\nto be paid. Underwriting costs are deferred and recognized inthe relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related\nunderwriting revenues are recorded.\nAdvisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client,\nbased on the estimated progress of work and when revenues are\nnot probable of a significant reversal. Advisory costs are\nrecognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line\nitems, including those reimbursed.\nCommissions and Fees\nCommission and fee revenues result from transaction-based\narrangements in which the client is charged a fee for the\nexecution of transactions. Such revenues primarily arise from\ntransactions in equity securities; services related to sales and\ntrading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds,\nfutures, insurance products and options. Commission and fee\nrevenues are recognized on trade date when the performance\nobligation is satisfied.\nAsset Management Revenues\nAsset management, distribution and administration fees are\ngenerally based on related asset levels being managed, such as\nthe AUM of a customer\u2019s account or the net asset value of a\nfund.

Therefore, even when market assumptions are not\nreadily available, assumptions are set to reflect those that the\nFirm believes market participants would use in pricing the asset\nor liability at the measurement date. Where the Firm manages\na group of financial assets, financial liabilities, and nonfinancial\nitems accounted for as derivatives on the basis of its net exposure\nto either market risks or credit risk, the Firm measures the fair\nvalue of that group of financial instruments consistently with\nhow market participants would price the net risk exposure at the\nmeasurement date.\nIn determining fair value, the Firm uses various valuation\napproaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value that requires the most observable inputs be\nused when available.\nObservable inputs are inputs that market participants would use\nin pricing the asset or liability that were developed based on\nmarket data obtained from sources independent of the Firm.\nUnobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the Firm\nbelieves other market participants would use in pricing the asset\nor liability that are developed based on the best information\navailable in the circumstances.

To the extent that\nvaluation is based on models or inputs that are less observable\nor unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value\nrequires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment\nexercised by the Firm in determining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level\u00a03 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the\nmeasurement date, including during periods of market\ndislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability\nof prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This\ncondition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from\nLevel\u00a01 to Level\u00a02 or from Level\u00a02 to Level\u00a03 of the fair value\nhierarchy.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall\ninto different\u00a0levels of the fair value hierarchy.\u00a0In such\u00a0cases,\nthe total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate\nfor the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair value\nof the asset or liability.\nValuation Techniques\nMany cash instruments and OTC derivative contracts have bid\nand ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid prices\nreflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for an asset.\nAsk prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing to\naccept for an asset. The Firm carries positions at the point within\nthe bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of fair value. For\noffsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same\nprice within the bid-ask spread is used to measure both the long\nand short positions.\nFair value for many cash instruments and OTC derivative\ncontracts is derived using pricing models. Pricing models take\ninto account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs,\nincluding, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices,\ninterest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation,\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the\nFirm, option volatility and currency rates.Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account\nfor various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments),\ncredit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk and\nfunding. Adjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived\nmid-market amounts of Level\u00a02 and Level\u00a03 financial\ninstruments for the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to\nproperly reflect the exit price of a risk position. Bid-mid and\nmid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed in trade activity,\nbroker quotes or other external third-party data. Where these\nspreads are unobservable for the particular position in question,\nspreads are derived from observable levels of similar positions.\nThe Firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its\nBorrowings for which the fair value option was elected and to\nOTC derivatives. The Firm considers the impact of changes in\nits own credit spreads based upon observations of the secondary\nbond market spreads when measuring the fair value for\nBorrowings.\nFor OTC derivatives, the impact of changes in both the Firm\u2019s\nand the counterparty\u2019s credit rating is considered when\nmeasuring fair value.

The Firm incurs losses or gains\nfor any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair value.\nFor assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis, fair value is determined by using various\nvaluation approaches. The same hierarchy for inputs as\ndescribed above, which requires that observable inputs be used\nwhen available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.\nFor further information on financial assets and liabilities that\nare measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis,\nsee Note 3 .\nOffsetting of Derivative Instruments\nIn connection with its derivative activities, the Firm generally\nenters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements\nwith its counterparties. These agreements provide the Firm with\nthe right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a\ncounterparty\u2019s rights and obligations under the agreement and\nto liquidate and set off cash collateral against any net amount\nowed by the counterparty. Derivatives with enforceable master\nnetting agreements are reported net of cash collateral received\nand posted.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, the Firm may not have such\nan agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime may not\nsupport the enforceability of the master netting agreement or\ncollateral agreement; or the Firm may not have sought legal\nadvice to support the enforceability of the agreement. In cases\nwhere the Firm has not determined an agreement to be\nenforceable, the related amounts are not offset (see Note 5 ).\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is generally to receive securities and cash\nposted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), irrespective\nof the enforceability determination regarding the master netting\nand collateral agreement. In certain cases, the Firm may agree\nfor such collateral to be posted to a third-party custodian under\na control agreement that enables it to take control of such\ncollateral in the event of a counterparty default. The\nenforceability of the master netting agreement is taken into\naccount in the Firm\u2019s risk management practices and application\nof counterparty credit limits.\nFor information related to offsetting of derivatives and certain\ncollateralized transactions, see Notes 5 and 7, respectively.Hedge Accounting\nThe Firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative\nfinancial instruments for the following types of hedges: hedges\nof changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to the\nrisk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net\ninvestments in foreign operations whose functional currency is\ndifferent from the reporting currency of the Parent Company\n(net investment hedges). These financial instruments are\nincluded within Trading assets\u2014Derivative and other contracts\nor Trading liabilities\u2014Derivative and other contracts in the\nbalance sheets. For hedges where hedge accounting is being\napplied, the Firm performs effectiveness testing and other\nprocedures.\nFair Value Hedges\u2014Interest Rate Risk\nThe Firm\u2019s designated fair value hedges consist of interest rate\nswaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark interest\nrate of certain fixed rate AFS securities and senior borrowings.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Firm also began designating\ninterest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in the\nbenchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits. The Firm\nis permitted to hedge the full, or part of the, contractual term of\nthe hedged instrument. The Firm uses regression analysis to\nperform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment\nof the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. A hedging\nrelationship is deemed effective if the change in fair value of\nthe hedging instrument (derivative) and the change in fair value\nof the hedged item (AFS security, deposit liability or borrowing),\ndue to changes in the benchmark interest rate, offset within a\nrange of 80% to 125% . The Firm considers the impact of\nvaluation adjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and\nits own credit spreads to determine whether they would cause\nthe hedging relationship to be ineffective.\nFor qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the\nchange in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the change\nin the fair value attributable to the change in the benchmark\ninterest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is recognized in\nearnings each period as a component of Interest income\n(expense).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4735, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2272a634-c5e1-46a7-b15c-dec8f4fc58e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2272a634-c5e1-46a7-b15c-dec8f4fc58e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b6a4cd45-a2b2-4cf6-b6e7-d91946a4f013", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "11044d2a1f1f6a515ee02b64a36591580b8f3e1496c02525ea0f405fd5c72b75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2dc83f2d-027a-43b0-bfdd-a0d8310411b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a0cc757cc4d53eef72cac461c9aa1cc558e7023f07d0e8c9a7e4b9a3263d04de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d0bf4e3-27f0-40f3-a866-c929c8d40293", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "314a95793f5b1391d2b45e74a250c0896a05468558665d6135fa3df94a73f96e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ccaae50a8e793f44d796cc54cad96c0186ed473c0d4d8737daca4a78f788cbd4", "text": "A hedging\nrelationship is deemed effective if the change in fair value of\nthe hedging instrument (derivative) and the change in fair value\nof the hedged item (AFS security, deposit liability or borrowing),\ndue to changes in the benchmark interest rate, offset within a\nrange of 80% to 125% .

Realized gains and losses on sales of AFS\nsecurities are classified within Other revenues in the income\nstatements (see Note 6 ). The Firm utilizes the \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d\nmethod as the basis for determining the cost of AFS securities.\nHTM securities are reported at amortized cost in the balance\nsheets. Interest income, including amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts on HTM securities, is included in Interest\nincome in the income statements.\nOTTI\nAFS securities and HTM securities with a current fair value less\nthan their amortized cost are analyzed as part of the Firm\u2019s\nperiodic assessment of temporary versus OTTI at the individual\nsecurity level. A temporary impairment is recognized in AOCI\nfor AFS securities.

If the Firm does not\nexpect to recover the entire amortized cost of those AFS or HTM\nsecurities, the impairment is considered OTTI, and the Firm\ndetermines what portion of the impairment relates to a credit\nloss and what portion relates to non-credit factors.A credit loss exists if the present value of cash flows expected\nto be collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate at\nacquisition of the security or discounted at the effective yield\nfor securities that incorporate changes in prepayment\nassumptions) is less than the amortized cost basis of the security.\nChanges in prepayment assumptions alone are not considered\nto result in a credit loss.\nWhen determining if a credit loss exists, the Firm considers\nrelevant information, including:\n\u2022the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has\nbeen less than the amortized cost basis;\n\u2022adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its\nindustry or geographic area;\n\u2022changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security,\nthe presence of explicit or implicit guarantees of repayment\nby the U.S. Government for U.S. Government and Agency\nsecurities or, in the case of an asset-backed debt security,\nchanges in the financial condition of the underlying loan\nobligors;\n\u2022the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the\nsecurity;\n\u2022the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood\nof the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the\nfuture;\n\u2022failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest\nor principal payments;\n\u2022the current rating and any changes to the rating of the security\nby a rating agency;\n\u2022recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance\nsheet date.\nWhen estimating the present value of expected cash flows,\ninformation utilized includes the remaining payment terms of\nthe security, prepayment speeds, financial condition of the \nissuer(s), expected defaults and the value of any underlying\ncollateral.\nLoans\nThe Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:\nloans held for investment;

Purchase price discounts or\npremiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are\namortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce\na level rate of return.\nAllowance for Loan Losses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The allowance for loan losses\nrepresents an estimate of probable losses related to loans\nspecifically identified for impairment in addition to the probable\nlosses inherent in the held-for-investment loan portfolio.\nThe Firm utilizes the U.S. banking agencies\u2019 definition of\ncriticized exposures, which consist of the Special Mention,\nSubstandard, Doubtful and Loss categories as credit quality\nindicators. For further information on the credit quality\nindicators, see Note 8 . Substandard loans are regularly reviewed\nfor impairment. Factors considered by management when\ndetermining impairment include payment status, fair value of\ncollateral, and probability of collecting scheduled principal and\ninterest payments when due. The impairment analysis required\ndepends on the nature and type of loans. Loans classified as\nDoubtful or Loss are considered impaired.\nThere are two components of the allowance for loan losses: the\nspecific allowance component and the inherent allowance\ncomponent.\nThe specific allowance component of the allowance for loan\nlosses is used to estimate probable losses for exposures that have\nbeen specifically identified for impairment analysis by the Firm\nand determined to be impaired. When a loan is specifically\nidentified for impairment, the impairment is measured based on\nthe present value of expected future cash flows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s effective interest rate or the observable market price\nof the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral\ndependent. A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of\nthe loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale or operation\nof the underlying collateral. If the present value of the expected\nfuture cash flows (or alternatively, the observable market price\nof the loan or the fair value of the collateral) is less than the\nrecorded investment in the loan, then the Firm recognizes an\nallowance and a charge to the provision for loan losses within\nOther revenues.\nThe inherent allowance component of the allowance for loan\nlosses represents an estimate of the probable losses inherent in\nthe loan portfolio and includes loans that have not been identified\nas impaired. The Firm maintains methodologies by loan product\nfor calculating an allowance for loan losses that estimates the\ninherent losses in the loan portfolio. Generally, inherent losses\nin the portfolio for non-impaired loans are estimated using\nstatistical analysis and judgment regarding the exposure at\ndefault, the probability of default and the loss given default.\nQualitative and environmental factors such as economic and\nbusiness conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, andlending terms and volume and severity of past due loans may\nalso be considered in the calculations. The allowance for loan\nlosses is maintained at a level to ensure that it is reasonably\nlikely to adequately absorb the estimated probable losses\ninherent in the portfolio. When the Firm recognizes an\nallowance, there is also a charge to the provision for loan losses\nwithin Other revenues.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Firm may modify the\nterms of certain loans for economic or legal reasons related to\na borrower\u2019s financial difficulties by granting one or more\nconcessions that the Firm would not otherwise consider. Such\nmodifications are accounted for and reported as a TDR. A loan\nthat has been modified in a TDR is generally considered to be\nimpaired and is evaluated for the extent of impairment using the\nFirm\u2019s specific allowance methodology. TDRs are also\ngenerally classified as nonaccrual and may be returned to accrual\nstatus only after considering the borrower\u2019s sustained repayment\nperformance for a reasonable period.\nNonaccrual Loans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Firm places loans on nonaccrual\nstatus if principal or interest is past due for a period of 90 days\nor more or payment of principal or interest is in doubt unless\nthe obligation is well-secured and in the process of collection.\nA loan is considered past due when a payment due according to\nthe contractual terms of the loan agreement has not been remitted\nby the borrower. Substandard loans, if identified as impaired,\nare categorized as nonaccrual, as are loans classified as Doubtful\nor Loss.\nPayments received on nonaccrual loans held for investment are\napplied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate\ncollectibility of principal. If collection of the principal of\nnonaccrual loans held for investment is not in doubt, interest\nincome is realized on a cash basis.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4880, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "323c9bfd-404b-45e8-a92a-6629fafc2d47": {"__data__": {"id_": "323c9bfd-404b-45e8-a92a-6629fafc2d47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "043866b0-5f5e-48f4-922f-72bf47d6e19a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1d884d7ec74e0f3cf834e8bae223aa7b72c0d50792db2509116d31ab4f451d69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e24d387b-ffd8-4e93-9acb-582d4f0028f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "27df2edc3323c3f983d38421599abfcedbb563e96745d941b9e069ce16f98fa0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2fc6da10-fbfb-4d1c-a9a0-84e8a4843ae0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b115ea3c5ce08df66fffbfd67ac7b693e3eb289ea71f52f579227ecec177c06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bacaf7053e8b4c1628066f276ca43395e95d13aac89e264889e13026091d02ae", "text": "Nonaccrual Loans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Firm places loans on nonaccrual\nstatus if principal or interest is past due for a period of 90 days\nor more or payment of principal or interest is in doubt unless\nthe obligation is well-secured and in the process of collection.\nA loan is considered past due when a payment due according to\nthe contractual terms of the loan agreement has not been remitted\nby the borrower.

The analysis also\nincorporates a credit conversion factor, which is the expected\nutilization of the undrawn commitment. The liability and\nexpense for the credit exposure are recorded in Other liabilities\nand accrued expenses in the balance sheets, and Other non-\ninterest expenses in the income statements, respectively. For\nmore information regarding loan commitments, standby letters\nof credit and financial guarantees, see Note 13 .\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue, with valuation changes recorded in Other revenues. The\nFirm determines the valuation allowance on an individual loan\nbasis, except for residential mortgage loans for which the\nvaluation allowance is determined at the loan product level. Any\ndecreases in fair value below the initial carrying amount and\nany recoveries in fair value up to the initial carrying amount are\nrecorded in Other revenues.

For both the annual and interim tests, the\nFirm has the option to either (i)\u00a0perform a quantitative\nimpairment test or (ii)\u00a0first perform a qualitative  assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case\nthe quantitative test would be performed.\nWhen performing a quantitative  impairment test, the Firm\ncompares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying\namount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment\nloss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair\nvalue, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to\nthat reporting unit.\nThe estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based\non valuation techniques the Firm believes market participants\nwould use for each respective reporting unit. The estimated fair\nvalues are generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash\nflow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable\ncompanies.\nIntangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives\nand are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when\nimpairment indicators are present. Impairment losses are\nrecorded within Other expenses in the income statements.\nEarnings per Common Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing earnings available to Morgan\nStanley common shareholders by the weighted average numberof common shares outstanding for the period. Earnings available\nto Morgan Stanley common shareholders represents net income\napplicable to Morgan Stanley reduced by preferred stock\ndividends. Common shares outstanding include common stock\nand vested RSUs where recipients have satisfied either the\nexplicit vesting terms or retirement-eligibility requirements.\nDiluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive\nsecurities.\nShare-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to\nvesting are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive)\nunder the treasury stock method.\nThe Firm has granted PSUs that vest and convert to shares of\ncommon stock only if predetermined performance and market\ngoals are satisfied. Since the issuance of the shares is contingent\nupon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the PSUs are\nincluded in diluted EPS based on the number of shares (if any)\nthat would be issuable if the end of the reporting period was the\nend of the contingency period.\nFor further information on diluted earnings (loss) per common\nshare, see Note 16  to the financial statements.\nDeferred Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Firm measures compensation expense for stock-based\nawards at fair value. The Firm determines the fair value of RSUs\n(including PSUs with non-market performance conditions)\nbased on the grant-date fair value of its common stock, measured\nas the volume-weighted average price on the date of grant\n(\u201cVWAP\u201d).

The assets of the employee stock trusts\nare consolidated with those of the Firm and are generally\naccounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock, where the\nshares of common stock outstanding reported in Common stock\nissued to employee stock trusts are offset by an equal amount\nreported in Employee stock trusts in the balance sheets.\nThe Firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based\ncompensation as the basis for recognition of the assets in the\nemployee stock trusts. Subsequent changes in the fair value are\nnot recognized as the Firm\u2019s stock-based compensation plans\nmust be settled by delivery of a fixed number of shares of the\nFirm\u2019s common stock.\nDeferred Cash-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation\nplans is calculated based on the notional value of the award\ngranted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced\ninvestments that employees select. Compensation expense is\nrecognized over the relevant vesting period for each separate\nvesting portion of deferred awards. Compensation expense for\nthese awards is adjusted based on notional earnings of the\nreferenced investments until distribution.\nThe Firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial instruments\nor other investments to economically hedge its obligations under\nits deferred cash-based compensation plans. Changes in the\nvalue of such investments made by the Firm are recorded in\nTrading revenues and Investments revenues. Although changes\nin compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value\nof the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes\nin the fair value of investments made by the Firm, there is\ntypically a timing difference between the immediate recognition\nof gains and losses on the Firm\u2019s investments and the deferred\nrecognition of the related compensation expense over the\nvesting period.\nRetirement-Eligible Employee Compensation\nFor year-end stock-based awards and deferred cash-based\ncompensation awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-\neligible employees under award terms that do not contain a\nfuture service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated cost\nof the awards over the course of the calendar year preceding the\ngrant date, which reflects the period over which the\ncompensation is earned.Carried Interest Compensation\nThe Firm generally recognizes compensation expense for any\nportion of carried interest (both realized and unrealized) that is\nallocated to employees. For information on performance-based\nfees in the form of carried interest, which are directly related to\ncarried interest compensation, see \u201cRevenue Recognition\u2014\nCarried Interest\u201d herein.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the\ntemporary differences between the financial statement and\nincome tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted\ntax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are\nexpected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax\nexpense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment date.\nSuch effects are recorded in income tax expense (benefit) from\ncontinuing operations regardless of where deferred taxes were\noriginally recorded.\nThe Firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it\nbelieves these assets are more likely than not to be realized.

Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign\ncurrency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and\nrelated tax effects, are reflected in AOCI in the balance sheets.\nGains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign\ncurrency transactions are included in net income, and amounts\nrecognized in the income statement are translated at the rate of\nexchange on the respective date of recognition for each amount.\nAccounting Updates Adopted in 2019\nSee Note 16  for a summary of the Retained earnings impact of\nthese adoptions. \nLeases\nUpon the adoption of Leases,  the Firm began recognizing in the\nbalance sheet leases with terms exceeding one year as right-of-\nuse (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and corresponding liabilities. The adoption\nresulted in an increase to Retained earnings of approximately\n$63 million , net of tax, related to deferred revenue from\npreviously recorded sale-leaseback transactions. At transition\non January 1, 2019, the adoption also resulted in a balance sheet\ngross-up of approximately $4 billion  reflected in Other assets\nand Other liabilities and accrued expenses. See Note 10  for lease\ndisclosures, including amounts reflected in the December\u00a031,\n2019  balance sheet. Prior period amounts were not restated.\nAs allowed by the guidance, the Firm elected not to reassess the\nfollowing at transition: whether existing contracts are or contain\nleases; and for existing leases, lease classification and initial\ndirect costs. In addition, the Firm continues to account for\nexisting land easements as service contracts.\nBoth at transition and for new leases thereafter, ROU assets and\nlease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present\nvalue of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term,\nincluding non-lease components such as fixed common area\nmaintenance costs and other fixed costs such as real estate taxes\nand insurance.\nThe discount rates used in determining the present value of\nleases are the Firm\u2019s incremental borrowing rates, developed\nbased upon each lease\u2019s term and currency of payment. The lease\nterm includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it\nis reasonably certain that the Firm will exercise that option. For\noperating leases, the ROU assets also include any prepaid lease\npayments and initial direct costs incurred and are reduced by\nlease incentives. For these leases, lease expense is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the lease term if the ROU asset has\nnot been impaired or abandoned.\nDerivatives and Hedging (ASU\u00a02018-16)\nThe amendments in this update permit use of the OIS rate based\non the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S. benchmark\ninterest rate for hedge accounting purposes. The Firm adopted\nthis update on a prospective basis for qualifying new orredesignated hedging relationships. This update did not impact\nthe Firm\u2019s pre-existing hedges.\nAccounting Update Adopted in 2018\nSee Note 16  for a summary of the Retained earnings impact of\nthis adoption. \nRevenue Recognition\nThe Firm adopted Revenues from Contracts with Customers\nusing the modified retrospective method. Our revenue\nrecognition policies are reflective of this update since adoption,\nwhile 2017 revenues and expenses remain as presented under\nthe prior accounting policy.\nThe more significant differences to the accounting policy in\nplace prior to adoption were: (i) the presentation of certain costs\nrelated to underwriting and advisory activities in that such costs\nwere recorded net of Investment Banking revenues versus the\ncurrent practice of recording the costs in the relevant non-\ncompensation expense line item; (ii) the presentation of certain\ncosts related to the selling and distribution of investment funds\nin that such costs were recorded net of Asset Management\nrevenues versus the current practice of recording the costs in the\nrelevant non-compensation expense line item; (iii) the\nrecognition of certain performance-based fees from fund\nmanagement activities not in the form of carried interest that\nwere recognized quarterly versus the current practice of\ndeferring the revenues until the fees are not probable of a\nsignificant reversal, and; (iv) the timing of the recognition of\nadvisory fees in that such fees were recorded when realizable\nversus the current practice of recognizing the fees as advice is\nprovided to the client, based on the estimated progress of work\nand when the revenue is not probable of a significant reversal.Table of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 2019 Form 10-K 92", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4532, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7655269b-ff52-44e5-ac21-1ec384249ee5": {"__data__": {"id_": "7655269b-ff52-44e5-ac21-1ec384249ee5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7c508e59-ee00-46f2-ad28-18fd2150fa31", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0f766f3afb87da153373bf316055e7bd90763bd19d657cfe472e36441877121a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4d77ab4-fff4-4aba-96a8-eb752a774a52", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "868e710f0f4556c8bce2115e77829c9116abb08bc49f82711c057af5ff9fe398", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f086103f-0ed6-440f-949e-c62bf5f85b9d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b500eace3f458c789e8117273b75f9cb85bb28500464f727b160b0f322e24b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "afff7f1e8c45a909f3c8cc53abecfd5d176f35dfe76d2cf7eb5f21f101b48f1c", "text": "3.

To\nthe extent these securities are actively traded, valuation adjustments are not applied.\n\u2022 Unlisted equity securities are generally valued based on an assessment of each security, considering\nrounds of financing and third-party transactions, discounted cash flow analyses and market-based\ninformation, including comparable transactions, trading multiples and changes in market outlook, among\nother factors.\n\u2022 Listed fund units are generally marked to the exchange-traded price if actively traded, or NAV if not.\nUnlisted fund units are generally marked to NAV.\nDerivative and Other Contracts\nListed Derivative Contracts \u2022 Level 1 - listed derivatives that are\nactively traded\n\u2022 Level 2 - listed derivatives that are\nnot actively traded\u2022 Listed derivatives that are actively traded are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange.\n\u2022 Listed derivatives that are not actively traded are valued using the same techniques as those applied to\nOTC derivatives as noted below.\nOTC Derivative Contracts \u2022 Generally Level 2 - OTC\nderivative products valued using\nobservable inputs, or where the\nunobservable input is not deemed\nsignificant\n\u2022 Level\u00a03 - OTC derivative products\nfor which the unobservable input\nis deemed significant\u2022 OTC derivative contracts include forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, foreign\ncurrencies, credit standing of reference entities, equity prices or commodity prices.\n\u2022 Depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of OTC derivative products can\nbe modeled using a series of techniques, including closed-form analytic formulas, such as the Black-\nScholes option-pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof. Many pricing models do not\nentail material subjectivity as the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment since\nmodel inputs may be observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate\nswaps, many equity, commodity and foreign currency option contracts, and certain CDS. In the case of\nmore established derivative products, the pricing models used by the Firm are widely accepted by the\nfinancial services industry.\n\u2022 More complex OTC derivative products are typically less liquid and require more judgment in the\nimplementation of the valuation technique since direct trading activity or quotes are unobservable. This\nincludes certain types of interest rate derivatives with both volatility and correlation exposure, equity,\ncommodity or foreign currency derivatives that are either longer-dated or include exposure to multiple\nunderlyings, and credit derivatives, including CDS on certain mortgage- or asset-backed securities and\nbasket CDS. Where required inputs are unobservable, relationships to observable data points, based on\nhistorical and/or implied observations, may be employed as a technique to estimate the model input\nvalues.  \nFor further information on the valuation techniques for OTC derivative products, see Note 2.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4581, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffcaaa74-5a61-44db-9933-cc3ba5eb5105": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffcaaa74-5a61-44db-9933-cc3ba5eb5105", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "74af3d7c-747e-4b7b-a6e3-0fe5adf7b294", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "27654c3de5e6fad815d5e9f054355b02e25dbfe7194858712fe0f0b0f625f1c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccc6136e-8c87-4b97-b3be-1059ff0e5a3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b7ff601986fd9314e321cc2a0f77e2d656fee1a7941be1dba611c692a44c383f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2cd820c-7410-4c5a-9bae-b3322a7e311e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9625d81ca8bc769f946f1526d847ab0c944a21b2a9c7a79a366dd5bff6a6f366", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3a130acade09ff66b09353f4f774490bd51fc632347e612b29caa610a3de9058", "text": "In the case of\nmore established derivative products, the pricing models used by the Firm are widely accepted by the\nfinancial services industry.\n\u2022 More complex OTC derivative products are typically less liquid and require more judgment in the\nimplementation of the valuation technique since direct trading activity or quotes are unobservable.

The fair value of these\ncertificates of deposit is determined using valuation models that incorporate observable inputs referencing\nidentical or comparable securities, including prices to which the deposits are linked, interest rate yield\ncurves, option volatility and currency rates, equity prices, and the impact of the Firm\u2019s own credit spreads,\nadjusted for the impact of the FDIC insurance, which is based on vanilla deposit issuance rates.\nSecurities Purchased under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase \u2022 Generally Level 2\n\u2022 Fair value is computed using a standard cash flow discounting methodology.\n\u2022 The inputs to the valuation include contractual cash flows and collateral funding spreads, which are the\nincremental spread over the OIS rate for a specific collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to\na specific type of security pledged as collateral).\nOther Secured Financings \u2022 For further

contracts which are not classified as OTC derivatives because they fail\nnet investment criteria.\nFor further information on the determination of valuation hierarchy classification, see the corresponding\nValuation Hierarchy Classification described herein.\nBorrowings \u2022 Generally Level 2\n\u2022 Level 3 - in instances where the\nunobservable inputs are deemed\nsignificant\u2022 The Firm carries certain borrowings at fair value which are primarily composed of: instruments whose\npayments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a\nspecific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments\nwith various interest-rate-related features including step-ups, step-downs, and zero

Valuation using comparable instruments can be\ndone by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid\nbenchmark) from the price of a comparable bond or loan, then\nadjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the bond\nor loan. The adjustment to yield (or spread) should account\nfor relevant differences in the bonds or loans such as maturity\nor credit quality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be\nassumed between the comparable instrument and the bond or\nloan being valued in order to establish the value of the bond\nor loan.\n\u2022Comparable equity price : A price derived from equity raises,\nshare buybacks and external bid levels, etc. A discount or\npremium may be included in the fair value estimate.\n\u2022Contingency probability : Probability associated with the\nrealization of an underlying event upon which the value of an\nasset is contingent.\n\u2022EBITDA multiple / Exit multiple : The ratio of Enterprise Value\nto EBITDA, where Enterprise Value is the aggregate value of\nequity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. The\nEBITDA multiple reflects the value of the company in terms\nof its full-year EBITDA, whereas the exit multiple reflects\nthe value of the company in terms of its full-year expected\nEBITDA at exit. Either multiple allows comparison between\ncompanies from an operational perspective as the effect of\ncapital structure, taxation and depreciation/amortization is\nexcluded.\n\u2022Recovery rate : Amount expressed as a percentage of par that\nis expected to be received when a credit event occurs.\nAn increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable\ninputs would generally result in a lower (higher) fair value.\n\u2022Cash-synthetic basis : The measure of the price differential\nbetween cash financial instruments and their synthetic\nderivative-based equivalents. The range disclosed in the\nprevious table signifies the number of points by which the\nsynthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quoted price\nof the underlying cash bonds.\n\u2022Credit spread : The credit spread reflects the additional net\nyield an investor can earn from a security with more credit\nrisk relative to one with less credit risk. The credit spread of\na particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield on\na credit risk-free benchmark security or reference rate,\ntypically either U.S. Treasury or LIBOR.\n\u2022Funding spread : The cost of borrowing defined as the\nincremental spread over the OIS rate for a specific collateral\nrate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specific type of\nsecurity pledged as collateral).\n\u2022WACC : WACC represents the theoretical rate of return\nrequired to debt and equity investors. The WACC is used in\na discounted cash flow model that calculates the value of theequity. The model assumes that the cash flow assumptions,\nincluding projections, are fully reflected in the current equity\nvalue, while the debt to equity ratio is held constant.\nAn increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable\ninputs would generally result in an impact to the fair value, but\nthe magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on\nwhether the Firm is long or short the exposure.\n\u2022Correlation : A pricing input where the payoff is driven by\nmore than one underlying risk. Correlation is a measure of\nthe relationship between the movement of two variables ( i.e.,\nhow the change in one variable influences a change in the\nother variable).\n\u2022Interest rate curve : The term structure of interest rates\n(relationship between interest rates and the time to maturity)\nand a market\u2019s measure of future interest rates at the time of\nobservation. An interest rate curve is used to set interest rate\nand foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is a pricing\ninput used in the discounting of any OTC derivative cash flow.\n\u2022Volatility : The measure of variability in possible returns for\nan instrument given how much that instrument changes in\nvalue over time. V olatility is a pricing input for options and,\ngenerally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the option.\nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular\noption depends on a number of factors, including the nature\nof the risk underlying that option, the tenor and the strike price\nof the option.\n\u2022Volatility skew : The measure of the difference in implied\nvolatility for options with identical underliers and expiry dates\nbut with different strikes.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4392, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6b5131b-e36b-4ffd-87c7-815c19d31c2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6b5131b-e36b-4ffd-87c7-815c19d31c2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bf7b0753-c5fe-421a-b7a9-f3d2564c87f5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3ae2faa95076fc02437848bffe2e541b9161d0d7efb51841da93e1577146a76d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6a2a463-33aa-4bf7-b600-4bb4443312db", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "92df57a541e89696d71f805b598966815ebe49cfecd4d6e57cbbf1cd0e7937d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae1fea20-8cec-4733-9eaf-b58a4683b4a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "25e441b57dec73e9317e43281744e33f571e8ecfd105502ddc7e6f9de964a067", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "559cbf6a1f212e824cdb3feaf3e36bf79828546d2896b388b6b5441f56db822d", "text": "An interest rate curve is used to set interest rate\nand foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is a pricing\ninput used in the discounting of any OTC derivative cash flow.\n\u2022Volatility : The measure of variability in possible returns for\nan instrument given how much that instrument changes in\nvalue over time.

A majority of the Firm\u2019s counterparties for\nthese derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and\nother financial institutions.\nThe fair value amounts as shown in the previous tables are prior\nto cash collateral or counterparty netting.\nThe purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole\nmanner in which the Firm risk manages its exposure to credit\nderivatives. The Firm manages its exposure to these derivative\ncontracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, which\ninclude managing the credit and correlation risk across single-\nname, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and\nbaskets, and cash positions. Aggregate market risk limits have\nbeen established for credit derivatives, and market risk measures\nare routinely monitored against these limits. The Firm may also\nrecover amounts on the underlying reference obligation\ndelivered to the Firm under CDS where credit protection was\nsold.Single-Name CDS .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A CDS protects the buyer against the loss\nof principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer.\nThe protection buyer pays a periodic premium (generally\nquarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the\nperiod. The Firm, in turn, performs under a CDS if a credit event\nas defined under the contract occurs. Typical credit events\ninclude bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced\nentity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the\nreferenced entity.\nIndex and Basket CDS .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Index and basket CDS are products\nwhere credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-name\nCDS. Generally, in the event of a default on one of the underlying\nnames, the Firm pays a pro rata portion of the total notional\namount of the CDS.\nThe Firm also enters into tranched index and basket CDS where\ncredit protection is provided on a particular portion of the\nportfolio loss distribution. The most junior tranches cover initial\ndefaults, and once losses exceed the notional of the tranche, they\nare passed on to the next most senior tranche in the capital\nstructure.\nOther Credit Contracts .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Firm has invested in CLNs and\nCDOs, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded\nderivatives, in which credit protection has been sold to the issuer\nof the note.

Collateralized Transactions  \nThe Firm enters into securities purchased under agreements to\nresell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities\nborrowed and securities loaned transactions to, among other\nthings, acquire securities to cover short positions and settle other\nsecurities obligations, to accommodate customers\u2019 needs and to\nfinance its inventory positions.\nThe Firm manages credit exposure arising from such\ntransactions by, in appropriate circumstances, entering into\nmaster netting agreements and collateral agreements with  its\ncounterparties. These agreements provide the Firm with the\nright, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a\ncounterparty's  rights and obligations under the agreement and\nto liquidate and set off collateral held by the Firm against the\nnet amount owed by the counterparty.\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is generally to take possession of securities\npurchased or borrowed in connection with securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions,\nrespectively, and to receive cash and securities delivered under\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase or securities\nloaned transactions (with rights of rehypothecation). \nThe Firm also monitors the fair value of the underlying securities\nas compared with the related receivable or payable, including\naccrued interest, and, as necessary, requests additional\ncollateral, as provided under the applicable agreement to ensure\nsuch transactions are adequately collateralized, or the return of\nexcess collateral.\nThe risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral\npledged or received is managed by setting appropriate market-\nbased margin requirements. Increases in collateral margin calls\non secured financing due to market value declines may be\nmitigated by increases in collateral margin calls on securities\npurchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed\ntransactions with similar quality collateral. Additionally, the\nFirm may request lower quality collateral pledged be replaced\nwith higher quality collateral through collateral substitution\nrights in the underlying agreements.\nThe Firm actively manages its secured financings in a manner\nthat reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured financings\nof less liquid assets and also considers the quality of collateral\nwhen negotiating collateral eligibility with counterparties. The\nFirm utilizes shorter term secured financing for highly liquid\nassets and has established longer tenor limits for less liquid\nassets, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market\ndisruption.

Also, the Firm may\nrecover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered to the\nFirm under the derivative contract.\nStandby Letters of Credit and Other Financial Guarantees\nIssued.  In connection with its corporate lending business and\nother corporate activities, the Firm provides standby letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. Such\narrangements represent obligations to make payments to third\nparties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a\nborrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. A\nmajority of the Firm\u2019s standby letters of credit are provided on\nbehalf of counterparties that are investment grade. If the\ncounterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the Firm\nhas access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its\nobligation.\nMarket Value Guarantees. Market value guarantees are issued\nto guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors\nin certain affordable housing tax credit funds. These guarantees\nare designed to return an investor\u2019s contribution to a fund and\nthe investor\u2019s share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be\ngenerated by a fund.\nLiquidity Facilities.  The Firm has entered into liquidity facilities\nwith SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the Firm is\nrequired to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur.\nPrimarily, the Firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond\nsecuritization SPEs and for standalone municipal bonds in\nwhich the holders of beneficial interests issued by these SPEs\nor the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the\nright to tender their interests for purchase by the Firm on\nspecified dates at a specified price. The Firm often may have\nrecourse to the underlying assets held by the SPEs in the event\npayments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as\nmake-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. The\nrecourse amount often exceeds the maximum potential payout\namount of the guarantee. Substantially all of the underlying\nassets in the SPEs are investment grade. Liquidity facilities\nprovided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified\nas derivatives.\nWhole Loan Sales Guarantees.  The Firm has provided, or\notherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and\nwarranties regarding certain whole loan sales. Under certain\ncircumstances, the Firm may be required to repurchase such\nassets or make other payments related to such assets if such\nrepresentations and warranties are breached. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum potential payout related to such representations and\nwarranties is equal to the current UPB of such loans. Since the\nFirm no longer services these loans, it has no information on the\ncurrent UPB of those loans, and accordingly, the amount\nincluded in the previous table represents the UPB at the time of\nthe whole loan sale or at the time when the Firm last serviced\nany of those loans. The current UPB balances could besubstantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount\nincluded in the previous table. The related liability primarily\nrelates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies.\nSecuritization Representations and Warranties. As part of the\nFirm\u2019s Institutional Securities business segment\u2019s\nsecuritizations and related activities, the Firm has provided, or\notherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and\nwarranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization\ntransactions sponsored by the Firm. The extent and nature of the\nrepresentations and warranties, if any, vary among different\nsecuritizations. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be\nrequired to repurchase certain assets or make other payments\nrelated to such assets if such representations and warranties are\nbreached. The maximum potential amount of future payments\nthe Firm could be required to make would be equal to the current\noutstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets\nsubject to breaches of such representations and warranties.

Certain of\nthese guarantees and indemnifications are described below:\n\u2022Indemnities. The Firm provides standard indemnities to\ncounterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes,\nincluding U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and\nother payments made on derivatives, securities and stock\nlending transactions, certain annuity products and other\nfinancial arrangements. These indemnity payments could be\nrequired based on a change in the tax laws, a change in\ninterpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual\ncircumstances. Certain contracts contain provisions that\nenable the Firm to terminate the agreement upon the\noccurrence of such events. The maximum potential amount\nof future payments that the Firm could be required to make\nunder these indemnifications cannot be estimated.\n\u2022Exchange/Clearinghouse Member Guarantees. The Firm is\na member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that trade\nand clear securities and/or derivative contracts. Associated\nwith its membership, the Firm may be required to pay a certain\namount as determined by the exchange or the clearinghouse\nin case of a default of any of its members or pay a proportionate\nshare of the financial obligations of another member that may\ndefault on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse.\nWhile the rules governing different exchange or\nclearinghouse memberships and the forms of these guarantees\nmay vary, in general the Firm\u2019s obligations under these rules\nwould arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had\npreviously exhausted its resources.\nIn addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to\nassume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the\nclearinghouse\u2019s investment of guarantee fund contributions\nand initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the default\nof a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specified\nresources allocated for such purpose by the clearinghouse.\nThe maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be\nestimated. The Firm has not recorded any contingent liability\nin its financial statements for these agreements and believes\nthat any potential requirement to make payments under these\nagreements is remote.\n\u2022Merger and Acquisition Guarantees. The Firm may, from time\nto time, in its role as investment banking advisor be required\nto provide guarantees in connection with certain European\nmerger and acquisition transactions. If required by the\nregulating authorities, the Firm provides a guarantee that the\nacquirer in the merger and acquisition transaction has or will\nhave sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would\nthen be required to make the acquisition payments in the event\nthe acquirer\u2019s funds are insufficient at the completion date of\nthe transaction. These arrangements generally cover the time\nframe from the transaction offer date to its closing date and,\ntherefore, are generally short term in nature. The Firm believes\nthe likelihood of any payment by the Firm under thesearrangements is remote given the level of its due diligence in\nits role as investment banking advisor.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Firm\nguarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including\nobligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange\ncontracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain\nsubsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product\nspecific and are required by investors or trading counterparties.\nThe activities of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries covered by these\nguarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations)\nare included in the financial statements.\nContingencies\nLegal\nIn addition to the matters described below, in the normal course\nof business, the Firm has been named, from time to time, as a\ndefendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class\nactions and other litigation, arising in connection with its\nactivities as a global diversified financial services institution.\nCertain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims\nfor substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims\nfor indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the\nentities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or are in financial distress.

The purchase\nof the transferred assets by the SPE is financed through the sale\nof these interests.\nIn many securitization transactions involving commercial\nmortgage loans, the Firm transfers a portion of the assets to the\nSPE with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets. In\naddition, mainly in securitization transactions involving\nresidential mortgage loans, the Firm may also enter into\nderivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest\nrate caps, with the SPE.\nAlthough not obligated, the Firm generally makes a market in\nthe securities issued by SPEs in securitization transactions. As\na market maker, the Firm offers to buy these securities from,\nand sell these securities to, investors. Securities purchased\nthrough these market-making activities are not considered to be\nretained interests; these beneficial interests generally are\nincluded in Trading assets\u2014Corporate and other debt and are\nmeasured at fair value.\nThe Firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps\nand interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many\nsecuritization transactions. The risks associated with these and\nsimilar derivatives with SPEs are essentially the same as similar\nderivatives with non-SPE counterparties and are managed as\npart of the Firm\u2019s overall exposure. See Note 5  for further\ninformation on derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Firm holds securities issued by VIEs within the Investment\nsecurities portfolio. These securities are composed of those\nrelated to transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage\nagencies and predominantly the most senior securities issued by\nVIEs backed by student loans and commercial mortgage loans.Table of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 2019 Form 10-K 128", "start_char_idx": 3436, "end_char_idx": 5841, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c05f037-3ef2-4ee2-a98e-49c3c478c384": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c05f037-3ef2-4ee2-a98e-49c3c478c384", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7392b9fc-6cd5-447a-8f99-d55d53097a45", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "11f4699a0549b7161bdb3e82aa11eb551952ce86bf84a795382cc9b25bde2a77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f704bfe-3e89-46f6-abcd-a9d3c3ccbe6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "MS2019.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2017506, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "530eefeaaa1e1f3609a9e2df8ae747df206b28f95c2fce906a4d267cb1244070", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "05ce5e60-8597-45bb-b8fd-475ea2b2c955", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cfe2ae36e3526588f311316ff3b133e234f83c88f14bef2be40608c9e414aa2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "185063beda1e46472a37985d8eae051180ab2e8494a551e5f819e59405e4f4d1", "text": "Transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies\ninclude an explicit or implicit guarantee provided by the U.S.\ngovernment. Additionally, the Firm holds certain commercial\nmortgage-backed securities issued by VIEs retained as a result\nof the Firm's securitization activities. See Note 6  for further\ninformation on the Investment securities portfolio.\nMunicipal Tender Option Bond Trusts\nIn a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client\ntransfers a municipal bond to a trust. The trust issues short-term\nsecurities that the Firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to\ninvestors. The client generally retains a residual interest. The\nshort-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility\npursuant to which the investors may put their short-term\ninterests. In most programs, a third-party provider will provide\nsuch liquidity facility; in some programs, the Firm provides this\nliquidity facility.\nThe Firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for\nremarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. The\nclient can generally terminate the transaction at any time. The\nliquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon\nthe occurrence of certain events. When the transaction is\nterminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to\nthe client. Any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the\nsale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. This\nobligation is generally collateralized. Liquidity facilities\nprovided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified\nas derivatives. The Firm consolidates any municipal tender\noption bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.\nCredit Protection Purchased through Credit-Linked Notes\nCLN transactions are designed to provide investors with\nexposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. In these\ntransactions, the Firm transfers assets (generally high-quality\nsecurities or money market investments) to an SPE, enters into\na derivative transaction in which the SPE sells protection on an\nunrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a credit\nderivative, and sells the securities issued by the SPE to investors.\nIn some transactions, the Firm may also enter into interest rate\nor currency swaps with the SPE. Depending on the structure,\nthe assets and liabilities of the SPE may be consolidated and\nrecognized in the Firm\u2019s balance sheets or accounted for as a\nsale of assets.\nUpon the occurrence of a credit event related to the referenced\nasset, the SPE will deliver securities collateral as payment to the\nFirm, which exposes the Firm to changes in the collateral\u2019s\nvalue.\nDerivative payments by the SPE are collateralized. The risks\nassociated with these and similar derivatives with SPEs are\nessentially the same as those with non-SPE counterparties and\nare managed as part of the Firm\u2019s overall exposure.Other Structured Financings\nThe Firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop and\nown low-income communities (including low-income housing\nprojects) and entities that construct and own facilities that will\ngenerate energy from renewable resources. The interests entitle\nthe Firm to a share of tax credits and tax losses generated by\nthese projects. In addition, the Firm has issued guarantees to\ninvestors in certain low-income housing funds. The guarantees\nare designed to return an investor\u2019s contribution to a fund and\nthe investor\u2019s share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be\ngenerated by the fund. The Firm is also involved with entities\ndesigned to provide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\nCollateralized Loan and Debt Obligations\nCLOs and CDOs are SPEs that purchase a pool of assets\nconsisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, ABS or synthetic\nexposures on similar assets through derivatives, and issue\nmultiple tranches of debt and equity securities to investors.

Regulatory Requirements  \nRegulatory Capital Framework\nThe Firm is an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of\n1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and oversight\nof the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). The Federal Reserve establishes capital\nrequirements for the Firm, including well-capitalized standards,\nand evaluates the Firm\u2019s compliance with such capital\nrequirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements\nand standards for MSBNA and MSPBNA (collectively, the\n\u201cU.S. Bank Subsidiaries\u201d). The regulatory capital requirements\nare largely based on the Basel III capital standards established\nby the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and also\nimplement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and\nleverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital\nrequirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory\ncapital, RWA and transition provisions follows.\nMinimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital\n(which includes Tier 2 capital).

The U.S. Qualified Plan uses a\ncombination of active and risk-controlled fixed income\ninvestment strategies. The fixed income asset allocation consists\nprimarily of fixed income securities and related derivative\ninstruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows\nof the plan\u2019s liabilities in order to help reduce plan exposure to\ninterest rate variation and to better align assets with the\nobligation. The longer-duration fixed income allocation is\nexpected to help protect the plan\u2019s funded status and maintain\nthe stability of plan contributions over the long run. The\ninvestment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing\nactual investment performance with changes in the estimated\npresent value of the U.S. Qualified Plan\u2019s benefit obligation.\nDerivative instruments are permitted in the U.S. Qualified Plan\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all\nof the plan\u2019s investment policy guidelines and are consistent\nwith the plan\u2019s risk and return objectives.\nAs a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the\nunderlying assets apply to a respective derivative product. This\nincludes percentage allocations and credit quality. Derivatives\nare used solely for the purpose of enhancing investment in the\nunderlying assets and not to circumvent portfolio restrictions.\nPlan assets are measured at fair value using valuation techniques\nthat are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the\nFirm\u2019s major categories of assets and liabilities as described in\nNotes 2 and 3. OTC derivative contracts consist of investments\nin interest rate swaps and total return swaps. Other investments\nconsist of pledged insurance annuity contracts held by non-U.S.-\nbased plans. The pledged insurance annuity contracts are valued\nbased on the premium reserve of the insurer for a guarantee that\nthe insurer has given to the employee benefit plan that\napproximates fair value. The pledged insurance annuity\ncontracts are categorized in Level\u00a03 of the fair value hierarchy.\nCommingled trust funds are privately offered funds regulated,\nsupervised and subject to periodic examination by a U.S. federal\nor state agency and available to institutional clients. The trust\nmust be maintained for the collective investment or\nreinvestment of assets contributed to it from U.S. tax-qualified\nemployee benefit plans maintained by more than one employer\nor controlled group of corporations. The sponsor of the\ncommingled trust funds values the funds based on the fair valueof the underlying securities. Commingled trust funds are\nredeemable at NA V at the measurement date or in the near future.\nSome non-U.S.-based plans hold foreign funds that consist of\ninvestments in fixed income funds, target cash flow funds and\nliquidity funds. Fixed income funds invest in individual\nsecurities quoted on a recognized stock exchange or traded in a\nregulated market. Certain fixed income funds aim to produce\nreturns consistent with certain Financial Times Stock Exchange\nindexes. Target cash flow funds are designed to provide a series\nof fixed annual cash flows achieved by investing in government\nbonds and derivatives. Liquidity funds place a high priority on\ncapital preservation, stable value and a high liquidity of assets.\nForeign funds are readily redeemable at NA V .\nThe Firm generally considers the NA V of commingled trust\nfunds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be the\nbest estimate of fair value.\nExpected Contributions\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is to fund at least the amount sufficient to\nmeet minimum funding requirements under applicable\nemployee benefit and tax laws.
