We compete in the U.S. and \nglobally for clients, market share and human talent. Operating within the financial services industry on a global basis \npresents, among other things, technological, risk management, \nregulatory, infrastructure and other challenges that require \neffective resource allocation in order for us to remain \ncompetitive. Our competitive position depends on a number \nof factors, including our reputation, client experience, the \nquality and consistency of our long-term investment \nperformance, innovation, execution, relative pricing and other \nfactors, including entering into new or expanding current \nbusinesses as a result of acquisitions and other strategic \ninitiatives. Our ability to sustain or improve our competitive \nposition also depends substantially on our ability to continue \nto attract and retain highly qualified employees while \nmanaging compensation and other costs. We compete with \ncommercial banks, investment banking firms, brokerage \nfirms, insurance companies, exchanges, electronic trading and \nclearing platforms, financial data repositories, sponsors of \nmutual funds, hedge funds, real assets funds and private credit \nand equity funds, energy companies, financial technology \nfirms and other companies offering financial or ancillary \nservices in the U.S.  and globally, including through the \ninternet . In addition, restrictive laws and regulations \napplicable to certain global financial services institutions, \nwhich have been increasing in complexity and volume, may \nprohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, impose \nmore stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increase \ncosts, and can put us at a competitive disadvantage to \ncompetitors in certain businesses not subject to these same \nrequirements.

In addition, at the \ntime of any sales and settlements of these financial \ninstruments, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the \ndemand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be \nmaterially lower than their current fair value.

This risk may arise \nfrom a variety of business activities, including, but not limited \nto: extending credit to clients through various lending \ncommitments; entering into swap or other derivative contracts \nunder which counterparties have obligations to make \npayments to us; providing short- or long-term funding that is \nsecured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at \ntimes be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment \namount; posting margin and/or collateral and other \ncommitments to clearing houses, clearing agencies, \nexchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial \ncounterparties; and investing and trading in securities and \nloan pools, whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate \nbased on realized or expected defaults on the underlying \nobligations or loans.\nWe also incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business \nsegment lending to mainly individual investors, including, but \nnot limited to, margin- and securities-based loans \ncollateralized by securities, and residential mortgage loans, \nincluding HELOCs.\nOur valuations related to, and reserves for losses on, credit \nexposures rely on complex models, estimates, and subjective \njudgments about the future. While we believe current \nvaluations and reserves adequately address our perceived \nlevels of risk, future economic conditions,  including inflation \nand changes in real estate values,  that differ from or are more \nsevere than forecast, inaccurate models or assumptions, or \nexternal factors such as global pandemics, natural disasters , or \ngeopolitical events,  could lead to inaccurate measurement of \nor deterioration of credit quality of our borrowers and \ncounterparties or the value of collateral and result in \nunexpected losses. We may also incur higher than anti cipated \ncredit losses as a result of (i)  disputes with counterparties over the valuation of collateral or (ii) actions taken by other lenders \nthat may negatively impact the valuation of collateral. In \ncases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the \nvalue or liquidity of collateral may result in significant losses \nto us despite our (i) credit monitoring; (ii) over-\ncollateralization; (iii) ability to call for additional collateral; or \n(iv) ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation, \nespecially where there is a single type of collateral supporting \nthe obligation.  In addition, in the longer term, climate change \nmay have a negative impact on the financial condition of our \nclients, which may decrease revenues from those clients and \nincrease the credit risk associated with loans and other credit \nexposures to those clients.

Factors that we cannot control, such \nas disruption of the financial markets or negative views about \nthe financial services industry generally, including concerns \nregarding fiscal matters in the U.S. and other geographic \nareas, could impair our ability to raise funding.\nIn addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if \ninvestors or lenders develop a negative perception of our \nlong-term or short-term financial prospects due to factors such \nas an incurrence of large trading losses, a downgrade by the \nrating agenci es, a d ecline in the level of our business activity, \nif regulatory authorities take significant action against us or \nour industry, or if we discover significant employee \nmisconduct or illegal activity.\nIf we are unable to raise funding using the methods described \nabove, we would likely need to finance or liquidate \nunencumbered assets, such as our investment portfolios or \ntrading assets, to meet maturing liabilities or other \nobligations. We may be unable to sell some of our assets or \nwe may have to sell assets at a discount to market value, either of which could adversely affect our results of \noperations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets \ndepend on our credit ratings.\nThe cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are \nimpacted by (among other things) our long-term and short-\nterm credit ratings.

The FDIC\u2019s power \nunder the orderly liquidation authority to disregard the \npriority of creditor claims and treat similarly situated creditors \ndifferently in certain circumstances, subject to certain \nlimitations, could adversely impact holders of our unsecured \ndebt.

An SPOE strategy generally \ncontemplates the provision of adequate capital and liquidity \nby the Parent Company to certain of its subsidiaries so that \nsuch subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement \nthe resolution strategy, and the Parent Company has entered \ninto a secured amended and restated support agreement with \nsuch entities, pursuant to which it would provide such capital \nand liquidity to such entities.\nIn addition, a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of the Parent \nCompany, Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (\u201cFunding IHC\u201d), \nserves as a resolution funding vehicle. The Parent Company \nhas transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing \nbasis, certain assets to the Funding IHC. In the event of a \nresolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated \nto contribute all of its material assets that can be contributed \nunder the terms of the amended and restated support \nagreement (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent \nCompany and certain other assets), to the Funding IHC.

Nonetheless, our risk management strategies, \nmodels and processes, including our use of various risk \nmodels for assessing market , credit , liquidity and operational  \nexposures an d hedging strategies, stress testing and other \nanalysis, may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk \nexposure in all market environments or against all types of \nrisk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated.\nAs our businesses change and grow, including through \nacquisitions, and the markets in which we operate evolve, our \nrisk management strategies, models and processes may not \nalways adapt with those changes.

As a result, \nthese methods may not predict future risk exposures, which \ncould be significantly greater than the historical measures \nindicate.\nIn addition, many models we use are based on assumptions or \ninputs regarding correlations among prices of various asset \nclasses or other market indicators and, therefore , cannot \nanticipate sudden, unanticipated , or unidentified market or \neconomic movements, such as the impact of a pandemic or a \nsudden geopolitical conflict, which could cause us to incur \nlosses.\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity, operational, model, \nlegal, regulatory and compliance risks requires, among other \nthings, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a \nlarge number of transactions and events, and these policies \nand procedures may not be fully effective.

For example, to the extent that our \ntrading or investing activities involve less liquid trading \nmarkets or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sales or \nhedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and, \ntherefore , reduce our risk associated with such positions. We \nmay, therefore, incur losses in the course of our trading or \ninvesting activities.

If we are unable \nto achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our \ncurrent response to climate change is perceived to be \nineffective or insufficient, our business and reputation may \nsuffer.\nThe risks associated with, and the perspective of regulators, \ngovernments, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders \nregarding, climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly, \nwhich can make it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us \nof climate change-related risks and uncertainties. As climate \nrisk is interconnected with other risk types, including \ngeopolitical risks, we have developed and continue to enhance \nprocesses to embed climate risk considerations into our risk \nmanagement strategies for risks such as market, credit and \noperational risks, as well as our governance struc tures . \nDespite our  risk management strategies, the unpredictability \nsurrounding the timing and severity of climate change events \nand societal or political changes in reaction to them make it \ndifficult to predict, identify, monitor and effectively mitigate \nclimate risk exposure.\nIn addition, the methodologies and data used to manage and \nmonitor climate risk are still in early stages and continue to \nevolve.  Current approaches utilize information and estimates \nthat have been derived from information or factors released \nby third-party sources, which may not reflect the latest or \nmost accurate data. Climate-related data, particularly \ngreenhouse gas emissions for clients and counterparties, \nremains limited in availability and variable  in quality. Certain \nthird-party information may also change over time as \nmethodologies evolve and are refined. While we believe this \ninformation is the best available at the time, we may only be \nable to complete limited validation. Furthermore, modeling \ncapabilities and methodologies to analyze climate-related \nrisks, although improving,  remain nascent and emerging . \nThese and other factors could cause results to differ materially \nfrom those expressed in the estimates and beliefs made by \nthird-parties and by us, which could also impact our \nmanagement of risk in this area.\nReplacement  of London Interbank Offered Rate and \nreplacement or reform of other interest rate benchmarks \ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations.\nCentral  banks around the world, including the Federal \nReserve, have sponsored initiatives in recent years to replace \nLIBOR and replace or reform certain other interest rate \nbenchmarks (collectively, the \u201cIBORs\u201d). A transition away \nfrom use of the IBORs to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms is underway and is a multi-\nyear initiative . These reforms have caused and may in the \nfuture  cause such rates to perform differently than in the past, \nor to cease  entirely , or have other consequences that are \ncontrary to market expectations.\nThe ongoing market  transition away from IBORs and other \ninterest rate benchmarks to alternative reference rates is \ncomplex and could have a range of adverse impacts on our \nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.

W e compete with commercial banks, investment \nbanking firms, brokerage firms, insurance companies, \nexchanges, electronic trading and clearing platforms, financial \ndata repositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, real \nassets funds and private credit and equity funds , energy \ncompanies, financial technology firms and other companies \noffering financial or ancillary services in the U.S. and \nglobally, including through the internet . We also compete \nwith companies that provide online trading and banking \nservices, investment advisor services, robo-advice \ncapabilities, access to digital asset capabilities and services , \nand other financial products and services. We compete on the \nbasis of several factors, including transaction execution, \ncapital or access to capital, products and services, innovation, \ntechnology, reputation, risk appetite and price.\nOver time, certain sectors of the financial services industry \nhave become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a \nbroad range of financial services have left businesses, been \nacquired by or merged into other firms, or have declared \nbankruptcy. Such changes could result in our remaining \ncompetitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such \nas the ability to offer a broader range of products and services \nand geographic diversity, or new competitors may emerge.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience pricing \npressures as a result of these factors and as some of our \ncompetitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices, \neliminating commissions or other fees, or providing more \nfavorable terms of business. In addition, certain of our \ncompetitors may be subject to different  and, in some cases, \nless stringent, legal and regulatory regimes  than we are, \nthereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage. Some new \ncompetitors in the financial technology sector have sought to \ntarget existing segments of our businesses that could be \nsusceptible to disruption by innovative or less regulated \nbusiness models. For more information regarding the \ncompetitive environment in which we operate, see \u201cBusiness\u2014Competition\u201d and \u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and \nRegulation.\u201d\nAutomated trading markets and the introduction and \napplication of new technologies may adversely affect our \nbusiness and may increase competition.\nWe continue to experience price competition in some of our \nbusinesses. In particular, the ability to execute securities, \nderivatives and other financial instrument trades electronically \non exchanges, swap execution facilities and other automated \ntrading platforms, and the introduction and application of new \ntechnologies will likely continue the pressure on revenues. \nThe trend toward direct access to automated, electronic \nmarkets will likely continue as additional markets move to \nmore automated trading platforms. We have experienced and \nwill likely continue to experience competitive pressures in \nthese and other areas in the future .\nOur ability to retain and attract qualified employees is \ncritical to the success of our business  and the failure to do \nso may materially adversely affect our performance.\nOur people are our most important asset. We compete with \nvarious other companies in attracting and retaining qualified \nand skilled personne l. If we are unable to continue to attract, \nintegrate and retain highly qualified employees, or do so at \nlevels or in forms necessary to maintain our competitive \nposition, or if compensation  costs required to attract and \nretain employees become more expensive , or the competitive \nmarket for talent further intensifies, our performance, \nincluding our competitive position and results of operations, \ncould be materially adversely affected.\nThe financial industry has experienced and may continue to \nexperience more stringent regulation of employee \ncompensation, including limitations relating to incentive-\nbased compensation, clawback requirements and special \ntaxation, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to \nhire or retain the most qualified employees.\nInternational Risk\nWe are subject to numerous political, economic, legal, tax, \noperational, franchise and other risks as a result of our \ninternational operations that could adversely

We are not entering any new business onshore in \nRussia and our activities in Russia are limited to helping \nglobal clients address and close out pre-existing obligations.\nRefer to \u201cRisk Factors\u201d  and \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d  \nfor more information on the potential effects of geopolitical \nevents and acts of war or aggression .\nSelected Non-GAAP Financial Information\nWe prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From \ntime to time, we may disclose certain \u201cnon-GAAP financial \nmeasures\u201d in this document or in the course of our earnings \nreleases, earnings and other conference calls, financial \npresentations, definitive proxy statement and otherwise. A \n\u201cnon-GAAP financial measure\u201d excludes, or includes, \namounts from the most directly comparable measure \ncalculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We \nconsider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be \nuseful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by \nproviding further transparency about, or an alternate means of \nassessing or comparing our financial condition, operating \nresults and capital adequacy.  \nThese measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, \nU.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with \nnon-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. \nWhenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will \nalso generally define it or present the most directly \ncomparable financial measure calculated and presented in \naccordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of \nthe differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and \nthe non-GAAP financial measure.  \nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we introduced new non-GAAP \nfinancial measure s. These measures exclude the impact of \nmark-to-market gains and losses on investments associated \nwith certain employee defer red cash-based  compensation \nplans from net revenues and compensation expenses . These \nemployee deferred cash-based compensation plans are \nprimarily reflected in our Wealth Management business \nsegment. We consider these new measures useful for analysts, \ninvestors, and other stakeholders to allow better comparability \nof period-to-period underlying operating performance and \nrevenue trends, especially in our Wealth Management \nbusiness segment . By excluding the impact of these items we \nare better able to describe the business drivers and resulting \nimpact to net revenues  and corresponding change to the \nassociated compensation expenses. \nCompensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation \nawards is calculated based on the notional value of the award \ngranted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation \nexpense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each \nseparately vesting portion of deferred awards.\nWe invest directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and \nother investments to economically hedge certain of our \nobligations under these deferred cash-based compensation \nplans. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of \nfinancing costs, are recorded in Net revenues , and included in \nTransactional revenues in the Wealth Management business \nsegment . Although changes in compensation expense \nresulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced \ninvestments will generally be offset by changes in the fair \nvalue of investmen ts recognized in net revenues , there is \ntypically a timing difference between the immediate \nrecognition of gains and losses on our investments and the \ndeferred recognition of the related compensation expense over \nthe vesting period. While this timing differenc e may not be \nmaterial to our Income  before provision for income taxes  in \nany individual period, it may impact t he Wealth Management \nbusiness  segment reported ratios and operating metrics  in \ncertain periods due to  potentially significant  impacts  to net \nrevenues and compensation expenses . For additional \ninformation on deferred cash-based compensation, refer to \n\u201cOther Matters\u201d herein.\nThe principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this \ndocument are set forth in the following tables.

Although changes in \ncompensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value \nof the referenced investments will generally be offset by \nchanges in the fair value of investments made by the Firm, \nthere is typically a timing difference between the immediate \nrecognition of gains and losses on the Firm's investments and \nthe compensation expense recognized over the vesting period.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision for our business segments is \ngenerally determined based on the revenues, expenses and \nactivities directly attributable to each business segment.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5232, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "196e59b9-4aa5-4aa0-9d8e-1060470777fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "196e59b9-4aa5-4aa0-9d8e-1060470777fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5689eef-55d7-450b-86cb-bbd739116312", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6dae7893ebc1df647ba8217f37de0b7db1fab74fb788948d4940077ac826376f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c5d92c4-422f-4e75-a34f-f80165a2453a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1d94512a32f301686f84f3cf03aebbdd9c2f16cb116f33ce1c89712030a32eab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "beaa6ad0-3f87-4c1e-99af-6d05b2ca0b5d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0d282d58e43697c4ae8b8b2b2aa5d455184ece93d9cbf7e429f8345cfd72db3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bdb91d021b4cf14167072e2098d6e3aca1eac265ca466e92835304a86cbfdffb", "text": "Compensation for other employees, including \nrevenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities \nbusiness segment, include base salary and benefit s and may \nalso include incentive compensation that is determined \nfollowing the assessment of the Firm\u2019s, business unit\u2019s and \nindividual\u2019s performance. \nCompensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation \nplans is recognized over the relevant vesting period and is \nadjusted based on the notional earnings of the referenced \ninvestments until distribution.

The Provision \nfor credit losses on loans and lending commitments was a net \nrelease of $7 million  in 2021, primarily as the impact of \nchanges in loan quality mix were offset by portfolio growth .\nFor further information on the Provision for credit losses, see \n\u201cCredit Risk\u201d herein.\nNon-interest Expenses\nNon-interest expenses of $17,467 million  in 2022  decreased  \n3% compared with the prior year  due to lower Compensation \nand benefits expenses, partially offset by higher Non-\ncompensation expenses.  \n\u2022Compensation and benefits expenses  decreased  in the  \ncurrent year primarily due to lower discretionary incentive \ncompensation on lower revenues, lower stock -based \ncompensation expense driven by the Firm\u2019s share price , and lower expenses related to certain deferred  cash-based \ncompensation  plans linked to investment performance, \npartially offset by higher salary expenses .\n\u2022Non-compensation expenses increased  in the current year  \nprimarily due to an increase in legal expenses, including \n$200 million related to a regulatory matter in the second \nquarter of 2022 and an increased spend on technology.\nIncome Tax Items\nThe effective tax rate of 19.5%  for 2022  was lower  compared \nwith the prior year, primarily driven by the realization of \ncertain tax benefits.Table of Contents  \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n31 December 2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3272, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25c67f60-ab66-4eb9-85c5-fa3b7ed9b91b": {"__data__": {"id_": "25c67f60-ab66-4eb9-85c5-fa3b7ed9b91b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46183563-cac6-413e-b7fb-091dc4cbf148", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "dd6045974e6302548e3ceb305ee0b2f69296808cc7afe4976a4e50deeb1cd000", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc55cc32-0fd2-4567-9afd-a7e6177e3290", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "97cf5fab9fbb19e6c48f03576764e66089e601b08c45d27649a03ef2aad82ae1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fa846e6d-bee7-4b10-8c08-08f062d393dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef3b18fbb5b631b7facbfe286ea0fc3b07af94c173fd002cf5880265092e0c38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ef6b5d97539eeed2fbcd8b408706a9404b6e4cec53f17aca753d955691a36bf4", "text": "Wealth Management\nIncome Statement Information\n    % Change\n$ in millions 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021\nRevenues\nAsset management $ 13,872 $ 13,966 $ 10,955  (1) %  27 %\nTransactional1 2,473  4,259  3,694  (42) %  15 %\nNet interest  7,429  5,393  4,022  38 %  34 %\nOther1 643  625  415  3 %  51 %\nNet revenues  24,417  24,243  19,086  1 %  27 %\nProvision for credit losses  69  11  30 N/M  (63) %\nCompensation and benefits  12,534  13,090  10,970  (4) %  19 %\nNon-compensation expenses  5,231  4,961  3,699  5 %  34 %\nTotal non-interest expenses  17,765  18,051  14,669  (2) %  23 %\nIncome before provision for \nincome taxes  6,583  6,181  4,387  7 %  41 %\nProvision for income taxes  1,444  1,447  1,026  \u2014 %  41 %\nNet income applicable to \nMorgan Stanley $ 5,139 $ 4,734 $ 3,361  9 %  41 %\n1.Transactional includes Investment banking, Trading, and Commissions and fees \nrevenues.

The menu of \ninvestments, which is selected by the Firm, includes fixed \nincome, equity, commodity and money market funds.\nCompensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation \nawards is calculated based on the notional value of the award \ngranted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the \nreferenced investments that employees select. Compensation \nexpense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each \nseparately vesting portion of deferred awards.\nWe invest directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and \nother investments to economically hedge certain of our \nobligations under these deferred cash-based compensation \nplans. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of \nfinancing costs, are recorded in Net revenues, and included in \nTransactional revenues in the Wealth Management business \nsegment. Although changes in compensation expense \nresulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced \ninvestments will generally be offset by changes in the fair \nvalue of investments recognized in net revenues, there is \ntypically a timing difference between the immediate \nrecognition of gains and losses on our investments and the \ndeferred recognition of the related compensation expense over \nthe vesting period.

Accounting updates not \nlisted below were assessed and either determined to be not \napplicable or to not have a material impact on our financial \ncondition or results of operations upon adoption.\nWe adopted the following accounting updates on January 1, \n2023:\n\u2022Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses. This accounting \nupdate eliminates the accounting guidance for Troubled \nDebt Restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and requires new disclosures \nregarding certain modifications of financing receivables \n(i.e., principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-\nthan-insignificant payment delays and term extensions) to \nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The update also \nrequires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by \nyear of origination for financing receivables measured at \namortized cost. We adopted this update on a prospective \nbasis and noted no impact on our financial condition or \nresults of operation  upon adoption .\nWe are currently evaluating the following accounting update , \nhowever, we do not expect a material impact on our financial \ncondition or results of  operations upon adoption :\n\u2022Fair Value Measurement . This accounting update clarifies  \nthat a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity \nsecurity is not considered part of the unit of account of the \nequity security and, therefore, is not considered in \nmeasuring fair value. The update also requires additional \ndisclosures including the fair value of equity securities \nsubject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and \nremaining duration of the restriction and circumstances that \ncould cause the restriction to lapse.

A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair \nvalue that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs \nand minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by \nrequiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when \navailable. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, \nwherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, \nLevel 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in \nmarkets that are not active or for which all significant inputs \nare observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques \nthat incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, \ntherefore, require the greatest use of judgment. The fair values \nfor the substantial majority of our financial assets and \nliabilities carried at fair value are based on observable prices \nand inputs and are classified in level 1 or 2 of the fair value \nhierarchy. Level 3 financial assets represented 1.4% and 1.1% \nof our total assets, as of December 31, 2022 and December \n31, 2021, respectively. \nIn periods of market disruption, the observability of prices \nand inputs, as well as market liquidity may be reduced for \nmany instruments, which could cause an instrument to be \nrecategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to \nLevel 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could \nlead to declines in the valuation of many instruments carried \nat fair value. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market \ninputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss \nrecorded for a particular position. The Firm uses various \nmethodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair \nvalue. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than \nthose used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of \nfair value at the reporting date. For further information on the \ndefinition of fair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related \nvaluation techniques, and quantitative information about and \nsensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 \nfair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 5 to the financial \nstatements.\nWhere appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account \nfor various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask \nadjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, concentration \nrisk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. For a further \ndiscussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2  \nto the financial statements.Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of \nJuly 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or \ncircumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment \nrequires management to make significant judgments , \nincluding, in part, the use of unobservable inputs that are \nsubject to uncertainty.  Goodwill impairment tests are \nperformed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the \nlevel of or one level below our business segments. Goodwill \nno longer retains its association with a particular acquisition \nonce it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the \nactivities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically \ndeveloped, are available to support the value of the goodwill.\nFor both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to \neither (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first \nperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is \nless than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative \ntest would be performed.\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare \nthe fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amou nt, \nincluding goodwill . If the fair value of the reporting unit is \nless than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is \nequal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, \nlimited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that \nreporting unit.\nThe carrying value of each reporting unit is determined based \non the capital allocated to the reporting unit.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4659, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96b7ac65-2346-4ef5-b08d-7f8c14eab001": {"__data__": {"id_": "96b7ac65-2346-4ef5-b08d-7f8c14eab001", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99525b53-a0a7-48ca-a44c-f673ca832f03", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e92d0680971534ca7b0236e5418daf8ed47557abf95eb320fcb9ebfadf0d1367", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e3b0886-529d-4262-b4d9-19c0d83a47f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ce3f99adc3844be7c910026b25f91231a815ed5590a13de2e67851e4d4be6851", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a7b21b92-cc60-4d6e-b9bc-b6ac380ee6f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01f27fa53c303146e1f540355b154e752d4538ca8b4d0ea0b4b4ea2591fad786", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2d92d8beea8e35fc8d2c5a1ab16560d8ca9db3d15227ab59d1af7e997827156a", "text": "For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to \neither (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first \nperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is \nless than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative \ntest would be performed.\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare \nthe fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amou nt, \nincluding goodwill .

These reviews include management\u2019s estimates \nand assumptions regarding future taxable income and \nincorporate various tax planning strategies, including \nstrategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards \nbefore they expire.\nOnce the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, \nwe may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax \nasset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely \nthan not to be realized at a future date. Both current and \ndeferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to our \nunrecognized tax benefits.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the \nconsolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, \ncurrent and deferred tax balances (including valuation \nallowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain \ntax positions.

The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill \nour financial obligations and support the execution of our \nbusiness strategies.\nThe following principles guide our Liquidity Risk \nManagement Framework:\n\u2022Sufficient Liquidity Resources should be maintained to \ncover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent \noutflows;\n\u2022Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, \nwith limited reliance on short-term funding;\n\u2022Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding \nshould be diversified; and\n\u2022Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, \nperiods of limited access to funding.\nThe core components of our Liquidity Risk Management \nFramework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity \nStress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our \ntarget liquidity profile.\nRequired Liquidity Framework\nOur Required Liquidity Framework establishes the amount of \nliquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed \nenvironments to ensure that our financial condition and \noverall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a \ntimely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers \nthe most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all \nregulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal \nentity level.\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nWe use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and \nintercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a \nrange of time horizons. These scenarios contain various \ncombinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of \ndifferent severity and duration. The methodology, \nimplementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity \nStress Tests are important components of the Required \nLiquidity Framework.\nThe assumptions used in our various Liquidity Stress Test \nscenarios include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022No government support;\n\u2022No access to equity and limited access to  unsecured debt \nmarkets;\n\u2022Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress \nhorizon;\n\u2022Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of \nsecured funding;\n\u2022Additional collateral that would be required by trading \ncounterparties, certain exchanges and clearing \norganizations related to credit rating downgrades;\n\u2022Additional collateral that would be required due to \ncollateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled \ncollateral;\n\u2022Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;\n\u2022Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third \nparties; and\n\u2022Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short \npositions that fund long positions.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4318, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1aed1d1d-4b12-4508-a852-6fbb9f048efb": {"__data__": {"id_": "1aed1d1d-4b12-4508-a852-6fbb9f048efb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "843bbe05-bb8d-4014-850d-103600bfd5ee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5dcb783cad1191e2265582883c4c13ec3f6e5879b340bb76921407c764234e31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a2376a4-de3b-44d9-8cd6-b74c6ef97317", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f8b62c13661409ad5413b312a2cea96d3982859e4f7cc3192e20329b47d2b5ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "12d957b1-ed3b-494b-a016-0c1d2a80d091", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c6d7ce146337fd3a0b9758500ae38640ba710057d8c614281c871ff06fb7abe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e71f13f8e6e6da0301ccd5d47cc9af72bf47cee0512ba72d13b360292d54ee0f", "text": "The methodology, \nimplementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity \nStress Tests are important components of the Required \nLiquidity Framework.\nThe assumptions used in our various Liquidity Stress Test \nscenarios include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022No government support;\n\u2022No access to equity and limited access to  unsecured debt \nmarkets;\n\u2022Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress \nhorizon;\n\u2022Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of \nsecured funding;\n\u2022Additional collateral that would be required by trading \ncounterparties, certain exchanges and clearing \norganizations related to credit rating downgrades;\n\u2022Additional collateral that would be required due to \ncollateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled \ncollateral;\n\u2022Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;\n\u2022Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third \nparties; and\n\u2022Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short \npositions that fund long positions.\nLiquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at \ndifferent levels, including major operating subsidiaries and \nmajor currencies, to capture specific cash requirements and \ncash availability across the Firm, including a limited number \nof asset sales in a stressed environment.

The Federal \nReserve establishes capital requirements for us, including \n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards, and evaluates our compliance \nwith such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar \ncapital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank \nSubsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely \nbased on the Basel III capital standards established by the \nBasel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the \nDodd-Frank Act. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain \nwell-capitalized in accordance with standards established by \nthe Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must \nremain well-capitalized in accordance with standards \nestablished by the OCC. In addition, many of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, \nincluding regulated subsidiaries provisionally registered as \nswap dealers with the CFTC or conditionally registered as \nsecurity-based swap dealers with the SEC or registered as \nbroker-dealers or futures commission merchants. For \nadditional information on regulatory capital requirements for \nour U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as our subsidiaries that \nare Swap Entities, see Note 17  to the financial statements.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nWe are required to maintain minimum risk-based and \nleverage-based capital and TLAC ratios.

The capital plan must include a discussion of how we \nwill maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital \nratios and how we will serve as a source of strength to our \nU.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios. In \naddition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out \nits heightened expectations for capital planning practices at \ncertain large financial institutions, including us.\nAs part of its annual capital supervisory stress testing process, \nthe Federal Reserve determines an SCB for each large BHC, \nincluding us . The SCB applies only with respect to \nStandardized Approach risk-based capital requirements and \nreplace d the Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation \nbuffer of 2.5%. The SCB is the greater of (i) the maximum \ndecline in our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the \nseverely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test \nmeasurement period plus the sum of the four quarters of \nplanned common stock dividends divided by the projected \nRWAs from the quarter in which the Firm\u2019s projected \nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital ratio reaches its minimum in \nthe supervisory stress test and (ii) 2.5%. \nThe supervisory stress test assumes that BHCs generally \nmaintain a constant level of assets and RWAs throughout the \nprojection period.\nA firm\u2019s SCB is subject to revision each year, taking  effect \nfrom October 1 to reflect the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s \nannual supervisory stress test. The Federal Reserve has \ndiscretion to recalculate a firm\u2019s SCB outside of the October 1 \nannual cycle and to require approval for certain  actions, in \nsome circumstances . The Feder al Reserve also has the \nauthority to impose restrictions on capital actions as a \nsupervisory matter.\nFor the 2022 capital planning and stress test cycle, we \nsubmitted our capital plan and company-run stress test results \nto the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2022. On June 23, 2022, \nthe Federal Reserve published summary results of its \nsupervisory stress tests of each large BHC, in which the \nprojected decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the \nseverely adverse scenario improved from the prior annual \nsupervisory stress test, from 4.7% to 4.6%. Following the \npublication of the supervisory stress test results, and as a \nresult of the increase in our common stock dividend and the \nresulting dividend add-on, we announced that our SCB will \nbe 5.8% from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. \nTogether with other features of the regulatory capital \nframework, this SCB results in an aggregate Standardized \nApproach Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.3%.\nWe also disclosed a summary of the results of our company-\nrun stress tests on our Investor Relations website and \nincreased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.775 per \nshare from $0.70, beginning with the common stock dividend \nannounced on July 14, 2022. Additionally, our Board of \nDirectors approved a new multi-year repurchase authorization \nof up to $20 billion of outstanding common stock, without a \nset expiration date, beginning in the third quarter of 2022, which will be exercised from time to time as conditions \nwarrant.\nAttribution of Average Common Equity According to the \nRequired Capital Framework  \nOur required capital (\u201cRequired Capital\u201d) estimation is based \non the Required Capital framework, an internal capital \nadequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business \nsegments is based on capital usage calculated under the \nRequired Capital framework, as well as each business \nsegment\u2019s relative contribution to our total Required Capital.  \nThe Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-\nbased capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory \ncapital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern \ncapital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, \nwhere applicable, at a point in time.

In line with our \nSPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has \nagreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its \nwholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings \nLLC (the \u201cFunding IHC\u201d). In addition, the Parent Company \nhas entered into an amended and restated support agreement \nwith its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and \ncertain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution \nscenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to \ncontribute all of its contributable assets to our supported \nentities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be \nobligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our \nsupported entities. The combined implication of the SPOE \nresolution strategy and the requirement to maintain certain \nlevels of TLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed \non the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of \neligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any \nlosses are imposed on creditors of our supported entities and \nwithout requiring taxpayer or government financial support .\nThe obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC \nunder the amended and restated support agreement are in \nmost cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the \nParent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the \nParent Company and certain other assets) and the assets of the \nFunding IHC. As a result, claims of our supported entities, \nincluding the Funding IHC, with respect to the secured assets, \nare effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent \nCompany .\nFor more information about resolution and recovery planning \nrequirements and our activities in these areas, including the \nimplications of such activities in a resolution scenario,  see \n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u2014Financial Holding \nCompany\u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning\u201d and \u201cRisk \nFactors\u2014Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.\u201d\nRegulatory Developments and Other Matters\nCovered Fund  Restrictions under the Volcker Rule\nThe Volcker Rule prohibits certain investments and \nrelationships by banking entities with covered funds, as \ndefined in the Volcker Rule. During the current quarter, we \nhave continued our assessment of conformance options \npermitted under the Volcker Rule with respect to certain \nlegacy illiquid funds for which we previously received a \nconformance extension until July 21, 2023. These \nconformance options include, but are not limited to, \nrestructuring our investments, selling a portion or all of our \ninterests in certain legacy illiquid funds and relying on other \napplicable exemptions and exclusions under the Volcker Rule. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our \ninvestments in those legacy illiquid funds approximated $230 \nmillion.  \nReplacement of London Interbank Offered Rate  and \nReplacement or Reform of Other Interest Rate  Benchmarks\nCentral banks around the world, including the Federal \nReserve, have sponsored initiatives in recent years to replace \nLIBOR and replac e or reform certain other interest rate \nbenchmarks (collectively, the \u201cIBORs\u201d ).

Accordingly, we have an Enterprise \nRisk Management (\u201cERM\u201d)  framework to integrate the \ndiverse roles of risk management into a holistic enterprise \nstructure and to facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment \ninto decision-making processes across the Firm.\nWe have policies and procedures in place to identify, \nmeasure, monitor, escalate, mitigate and control  the principal \nrisks involved in the activities of the Institutional Securities, \nWealth Management and Investment Management business \nsegments, as well as at the Parent Company level. The \nprincipal risks involved in our business activities are both \nfinancial and non-financial and include market (including \nnon-trading risks), credit, liquidity, model, operational, \ncompliance, cybersecurity, strategic, reputational and conduct  \nrisk. Strategic risk is integrated into our business planning, \nembedded in the evaluation of all principal risks and overseen \nby the Board.\nThe cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the \npursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk taking \nthat protects our capital base and franchise. This philosophy is \nimplemented through the ERM framework. Five key \nprinciples underlie this philosophy: integrity, \ncomprehensiveness, independence, accountability and \ntransparency. To help ensure the efficacy of risk management, \nwhich is an essential component of our reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent reporting and the \nappropriate escalation of risk matters. The fast-paced, \ncomplex and constantly evolving nature of global financial \nmarkets requires us to maintain a risk management culture \nthat is incisive, knowledgeable about specialized products and \nmarkets, and subject to ongoing review and enhancement.\nOur risk appetite defines the aggregate level and types of risk  \nthat the Firm is willing to accept to achieve its business \nobjectives, taking into account the interests of clients and \nfiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and other \nregulatory requirements. This risk appetite is embedded in our \nrisk culture and linked to our short-term and long-term \nstrategic, capital and financial plans, as well as compensation \nprograms. This risk appetite and the related Board-level risk \nlimits and risk tolerance statements are reviewed and \napproved by the Risk Committee of the Board (\u201cBRC\u201d) and \nthe Board on at least an annual basis.\nRisk Governance Structure\nRisk management  at the Firm requires independent Firm-level \noversight, accountability of our business divisions, and \neffective communication of risk matters across the Firm, to \nsenior management and ultimately to the Board. Our risk \ngovernance structure is set forth in the following chart and \nalso includes risk managers, committees, and groups within \nand across business segments and operating legal entities. The \nERM framework, composed of independent but \ncomplementary entities, facilitates efficient and \ncomprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and \nprocesses.\nRRP\u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning\n1.Committees include the Capital Commitment Committee, Global Large Loan Committee, Equity Underwriting Committee, Leveraged Finance Underwriting Committee and \nMunicipal Capital Commitment Committee.\n2.Committee s include the Securities Risk Committee, Wealth Management Risk Committee and Investment Management Risk Committee.Table of Contents  \n53 December 2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3665, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c0cd4b1-00c8-41df-92d9-0baf1e521e49": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c0cd4b1-00c8-41df-92d9-0baf1e521e49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc545eea-83e0-4aa0-a8a5-d4397901a5f3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2d5e003584423fa064032877bf53be303b66aff91552f5f7c2537a6ec1950a19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e24bc622-ceef-4930-b5cf-2ea31acd5855", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "139ad1bacaa6673338f105b10b1ab47dcdd769aa7fa4c8eeeaa2e44069623859", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "38246739-c430-42fa-bf8a-bb9abde6e549", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a132f3e01040faadb20c875083912fc9c2134ed3f709f5ab5a8dbbcd06f56e49", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d1df92ab0cec0bd9f8a0fddfb474fd1117f356cb0dcf2db84005d4824eb9dbff", "text": "Morgan Stanley Board of Directors\nThe Board has oversight of the ERM framework and is \nresponsible for helping to ensure that our risks are managed in \na sound manner.

Our risk-taking capacity is sized through the Firm\u2019s \ncapital planning process where losses are estimated under the \nFirm\u2019s BHC Severely Adverse stress testing scenario. We \nalso maintain a comprehensive suite of risk limits and \nquantitative metrics to support and implement our risk \nappetite statement. Our risk limits support linkages between \nthe overall risk appetite, which is reviewed by the Board, and \nmore granular risk-taking decisions and activities.\nRisk limits, once established, are reviewed and updated on at \nleast an annual basis, with more frequent updates as \nnecessary. Board-level risk limits address the most important \nFirmwide aggregations of risk . Additional risk limits \napproved by the FRC address more specific types of risk and \nare bound by the higher-level Board risk limits.\nRisk Management Process\nIn subsequent sections, we discuss our risk management \npolicies and procedures for our primary risks  involved in the \nactivities of  our Institutional Securities, Wealth Management \nand Investment Management business segments . These \nsections and the estimated amounts of our risk exposure \ngenerated by our statistical analyses are forward-looking \nstatements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks \nare not predictions of future events, and actual results may \nvary significantly from such analyses due to events in the \nmarkets in which we operate and certain other factors \ndescribed in the following paragraphs.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one \nor more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, \ncorrelations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, \nwill result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we \nincur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client \nfacilitation activities, principally within the Institutional \nSecurities business segment where the substantial majority of \nour VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, \nwe incur non-trading market risk, principally within the \nWealth Management and Investment Management business \nsegments. The Wealth Management business segment \nprimarily incurs non-trading market risk (including interest rate risk) from lending and deposit-taking activities. The \nInvestment Management business segment primarily incurs \nnon-trading market risk from capital investments in its funds. \nMarket risk also includes non-trading interest rate risk. Non-\ntrading interest rate risk in the banking book (amounts \nclassified for regulatory capital purposes under the banking \nbook regime) refers to the exposure that a change in interest \nrates will result in prospective earnings changes for assets and \nliabilities in the banking book.\nSound market risk management is an integral part of our \nculture. The various business units and trading desks are \nresponsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-\nmanaged and prudent. The control groups help ensure that \nthese risks are measured and closely monitored and are made \ntransparent to senior management. The Market Risk \nDepartment is responsible for ensuring the transparency of \nmaterial market risks, monitoring compliance with established \nlimits and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior \nmanagement.\nTo execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department \nmonitors our risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, \nperforms a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk \nsummaries, and maintains our VaR and scenario analysis \nsystems. Market risk is also monitored through various \nmeasures: by use of statistics (including VaR and related \nanalytical measures); by measures of position  size and \nsensitivity ; and through routine stress testing, which measures \nthe impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified \nchanges in market factors and scenarios designed by the \nMarket Risk Department in collaboration with the business \nunits.

Commodity exposures are subject to periods \nof high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and \ndemand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; \nphysical production and transportation; or geopolitical and \nother events that affect the available supply and level of \ndemand for these commodities.\nWe manage our trading positions by employing a variety of \nrisk mitigation strategies. These strategies include \ndiversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging \nactivities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related \nsecurities and financial instruments, including a variety of \nderivative products ( e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and \noptions). Hedging activities may not always provide effective \nmitigation against trading losses due to differences in the \nterms, specific characteristics or other basis risks that may \nexist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that \nis being hedged.\nWe manage the market risk associated with our trading \nactivities on a Firmwide basis, on a worldwide trading \ndivision level and on an individual product basis. We manage \nand monitor our market risk exposures in such a way as to \nmaintain a portfolio that we believe is well-diversified in the \naggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects \nour aggregate risk tolerance as established by our senior \nmanagement.\nAggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Firm \nacross all divisions worldwide. Additional market risk limits \nare assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and \nregions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, \ntraders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk \nmeasures against limits in accordance with policies set by our \nsenior management.Value-at-Risk\nThe statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we \nuse to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures \nof our trading portfolios.  The Market Risk Department \ncalculates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to \nvarious levels of management.\nWe estimate VaR using a model based on a one-year equal \nweighted historical simulation for general market risk factors \nand name-specific risk in corporate  equities  and related \nderivatives, and Monte Carlo simulation for name-specific \nrisk in bonds, loans and related derivatives. The model \nconstructs a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the \nvalue of trading portfolios based on historical observation of \ndaily changes in key market indices or other market risk \nfactors, and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio \nvalues to these market risk factor changes.\nVaR for risk management purposes (\u201cManagement VaR\u201d) is \ncomputed at a 95% level of confidence over a one-day time \nhorizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading losses \nresulting from adverse daily market moves.

VaR is most \nappropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid \nfinancial markets and will understate the risk associated with \nsevere events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. We are \naware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use VaR \nas only one component in our risk management oversight \nprocess. This process also incorporates stress testing and \nscenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis and \ncontrol at the trading desk, division and Firm levels.\nWe update our VaR model in response to changes in the \ncomposition of trading portfolios and to improvements in \nmodeling techniques and systems capabilities. We are \ncommitted to continuous review and enhancement of VaR \nmethodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving \nrisks associated with changes in market structure and \ndynamics. As part of our regular process improvements, \nadditional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be \nadded to improve the VaR model\u2019s ability to more accurately \nestimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors.\nSince the reported VaR statistics are estimates based on \nhistorical data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of our \nfuture revenues or financial performance or of our ability to \nmonitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that our \nactual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR \namounts indicated in the following tables or that such losses \nwill not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a \n95%/one-day VaR. VaR does not predict the magnitude of \nlosses that, should they occur, may be significantly greater \nthan the VaR amount.\nVaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because \nof differences in the firms\u2019 portfolios, modeling assumptions \nand methodologies. These differences can result in materially \ndifferent VaR estimates across firms for similar portfolios. \nThe impact of such differences varies depending on the factor \nhistory assumptions, the frequency with which the factor \nhistory is updated and the confidence level. As a result, VaR \nstatistics are more useful when interpreted as indicators of \ntrends in a firm\u2019s risk profile rather than as an absolute \nmeasure of risk to be compared across firms.\nOur regulators have approved the same VaR model we use for \nrisk management purposes for use in regulatory calculations.\nThe portfolio of positions used for Management VaR differs \nfrom that used for Regulatory VaR.

The \nsensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response \nto these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other \nmacroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in \ninterest rates and includes subjective assumptions regarding \ncustomer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors.  \nNet interest income sensitivity to interest rates at  December Table of Contents  \nRisk Disclosures\n59 December 2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3983, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d2cd77e-87d2-426e-b9ee-b1c4254de8da": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d2cd77e-87d2-426e-b9ee-b1c4254de8da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645fcdae-b425-40e4-835f-a07c48c18349", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0ba013fa0f17b9058f039f525431cc54983a307a709b55eca6f8b8d162895b21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e10a286a-867f-47c7-b79d-0b82fc132cc6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e359dc7e926bfdd93be2812182af421f4b4969a82c2352d1ca810bdfeda1e1bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fde8113d-2ed9-43cb-bc09-a9d6e4321131", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91a0b6e00fbd72a963c457282990ed19eea399ea393ba278ca6d98036d837166", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6a839b33c3999aa4a5515590bf3214915f41cc4dbefc61d81c788a8beb7fd3ca", "text": "31, 2022  decreased from December 31, 2021 , primarily \ndriven by the effects of changes in the the mix of our a ssets \nand liabilities and significant changes in market rates.\nInvestments Sensitivity, Including Related Carried Interest\n Loss from 10% Decline\n$ in millionsAt\nDecember 31,\n2022 At\nDecember 31,\n2021 \nInvestments related to Investment \nManagement activities $ 431 $ 407 \nOther investments:\nMUMSS  143  167 \nOther Firm investments  378  331 \nWe have exposure to public and private companies through \ndirect investments, as well as through funds that invest in \nthese assets.

Credit evaluations typically involve the \nassessment of financial statements; leverage; liquidity; capital \nstrength; asset composition and quality; market capitalization; \naccess to capital markets; adequacy of collateral, if \napplicable; and, in the case of certain loans, cash flow \nprojections and debt service requirements. The CRM  also \nevaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, \nmanagement and other factors  such as country risks and legal \nand contingent risks  that could affect the obligor\u2019s risk \nprofile. Additionally, the CRM evaluates the relative position \nof our exposure in the borrower\u2019s capital structure and \nrelative recovery prospects, as well as other structural \nelements of the particular transaction.\nThe evaluation of consumer borrowers is tailored to the \nspecific type of lending.

The \nunderwriting of residential real estate loans includes, but is \nnot limited to, review of the obligor\u2019s debt-to-income ratio, \nnet worth, liquidity, collateral, LTV ratio and industry \nstandard credit scoring models ( e.g., FICO scores). \nSubsequent credit monitoring for individual loans is \nperformed at the portfolio level, and collateral values are \nmonitored on an ongoing basis.\nCredit risk metrics assigned to our borrowers during the \nevaluation process are incorporated into the CRM \nmaintenance of the allowance for credit losses .

lending allows clients to borrow money \nagainst the value of qualifying securities, generally for any \npurpose other than purchasing, trading or carrying securities  \nor refinancing margin debt. We establish approved credit lines \nagainst qualifying securities and m onitor limits daily and, \npursuant to such guidelines, require customers to deposit \nadditional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when \nnecessary. These credit lines are primarily uncommitted loan \nfacilities, as we reserve the right  not to make any advances or \nmay terminate these credit lines at any time.

We may incur operational risk across the full scope of \nour business activities, including revenue-generating activities  \nand support and control groups ( e.g., information technology \nand trade processing).\nWe have established an operational risk framework to \nidentify, measure, monitor and control risk across the Firm. \nEffective operational risk management is essential to reducing \nthe impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, \nregulatory and reputational risks. The framework is \ncontinually evolving to account for changes in the Firm and to \nrespond to the changing regulatory and business environment.\nWe have implemented operational risk data and assessment \nsystems to monitor and analyze internal and external \noperational risk events, to assess business environment and \ninternal control factors, and to perform scenario analysis. The \ncollected data elements are incorporated in the operational \nrisk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative \nand qualitative elements. Internal loss data and scenario \nanalysis results are direct inputs to the capital model, while \nexternal operational incidents, business environment and \ninternal control factors are evaluated as part of the scenario \nanalysis process.\nIn addition, we employ a variety of risk processes and \nmitigants to manage our operational risk exposures. These \ninclude a governance framework, a comprehensive risk \nmanagement program and insurance. Operational risks and \nassociated risk exposures are assessed relative to the risk \nappetite reviewed and confirmed by the Board and are \nprioritized accordingly.\nThe breadth and range of operational risk are such that the \ntypes of mitigating activities are wide-ranging. Examples of \nactivities include: continuous enhancement of defenses \nagainst cyber attacks; use of legal agreements and contracts to \ntransfer and/or limit operational risk exposures; due diligence; \nimplementation of enhanced policies and procedures; \ntechnology change management controls; exception \nmanagement processing controls; and segregation of duties.\nPrimary responsibility for the management of operational risk \nis with the business segments, the control groups and the \nbusiness managers therein. The business managers  maintain \nprocesses and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, \nmitigate and report operational risk. Each of the business \nsegments has a designated operational risk coordinator. The \noperational risk coordinator regularly reviews operational risk \nissues and reports to our senior management within each \nbusiness. Each control group also has a designated operational risk coordinator and a forum for discussing operational risk \nmatters with our senior management. Oversight  of operational \nrisk is provided by the Operational Risk  Oversight \nCommittee, legal entity risk committees, regional risk \ncommittees and senior management. In the event of a merger; \njoint venture; divestiture; reorganization; or creation of a new \nlegal entity, a new product, or a business activity, operational \nrisks are considered, and any necessary changes in processes \nor controls are implemented.\nThe Operational Risk Department (\u201cORD\u201d) provides \nindependent oversight of operational risk and assesses, \nmeasures and monitors operational risk against appetite. The \nORD works with the divisions and control groups to embed a \ntransparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for \nmanaging operational risk within each area and across the \nFirm.\nThe ORD scope includes oversight of technology risk, \ncybersecurity risk, information security risk, the fraud risk \nmanagement and prevention program, and third-party risk \nmanagement (supplier and affiliate risk oversight and \nassessment), among others.\nCybersecurity\nOur cybersecurity and information security policies, \nproced ures and technologies are designed to protect our own, \nour client and our employee data against unauthorized \ndisclosure, modification or misuse and are also designed to \naddress regulatory requirements. These policies and \nprocedures cover a broad range of areas, including: \nidentification of internal and external threats, access control, \ndata security, protective controls, detection of malicious or \nunauthorized activity, incident response and recovery \nplanning.\nFirm Resilience\nThe Firm\u2019s critical processes and businesses could be \ndisrupted by events including cyber attacks, failure or loss of \naccess to technology and/or associated data, military conflicts, \nacts of terror, natural disasters, severe weather events and \ninfectious disease.

Our risk-based \napproach to managing exposure to these services includes the \nperformance of due diligence, implementation of service level \nand other contractual agreements, consideration of operational \nrisks and ongoing monitoring of third-party suppliers\u2019 \nperformance. We maintain and continue to enhance our third-\nparty risk management progr am, wh ich is designed to align \nwith our risk tolerance and meet regulatory requirements. The \nprogram includes appropriate governance, policies, \nprocedures and enabling technology. The third-party risk \nmanagement program includes the adoption of appropriate \nrisk management controls and practices throughout the third-\nparty management life cycle to manage risk of service failure, \nrisk of data loss and reputational risk, among others. \nModel Risk\nModel risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences \nfrom decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. \nModel risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and \nstrategic decision making or damage to our reputation. The \nrisk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, \ncomplexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions.\nModel risk is generated from the use of models impacting \nfinancial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy \nassessments and the formulation of strategy.\nSound model risk management is an integral part of our Risk \nManagement Framework. The Model Risk Management \nDepartment (\u201cMRM\u201d) is a distinct department in Risk \nManagement responsible for the oversight of model risk.\nThe MRM  establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our \nrisk appetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the \nmateriality of the risk of financial loss or reputational damage \ndue to errors in design, implementation and/or inappropriate \nuse of models. The tolerance is monitored through model-\nspecific and aggregate business-level assessments, which are \nbased upon qualitative and quantitative factors.\nA guiding principle for managing model risk is the \u201ceffective \nchallenge\u201d of models. The effective challenge of models is \ndefined as critical analysis by objective, informed parties who \ncan identify model limitations and assumptions and drive \nappropriate changes. The MRM provides effective challenge \nof models, independently validates and approves models for \nuse, annually recertifies models, identifies and tracks \nremediation plans for model limitations and reports on model \nrisk metrics. The department also oversees the development \nof controls to support a complete and accurate Firmwide \nmodel inventory.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to \nfinance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital \nmarkets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our \nfinancial obligations without experiencing significant \nbusiness disruption or reputational damage that may threaten \nour viability as a going concern.  Liquidity risk also \nencompasses the associated funding risks triggered by the \nmarket or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively \naffect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new \nfunding. Generally, we incur liquidity and funding risk as a \nresult of our trading, lending, investing and client facilitation \nactivities.\nOur Liquidity Risk Management Framework is critical to \nhelping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves \nand durable funding sources to meet our daily obligations and \nto withstand unanticipated stress events. The Liquidity Risk \nDepartment is a distinct area in Risk Management responsible \nfor the oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk. The \nLiquidity Risk Department ensures transparency of material \nliquidity and funding risks, compliance with established risk \nlimits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate \nsenior management.\nTo execute these responsibilities, the Liquidity Risk \nDepartment establishes limits in line with our risk appetite, \nidentifies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to \nensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and \nreports risk exposures against metrics and limits, and reviews \nthe methodologies and assumptions underpinning our \nLiquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and \nfunding under a range of adverse scenarios. \nThe Treasury Department and applicable business units have \nprimary responsibility for evaluating, monitoring and \ncontrolling the liquidity and funding risks arising from our \nbusiness activities and for maintaining processes and controls \nto manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. The \nLiquidity Risk Department coordinates with the Treasury \nDepartment and these business units to help ensure a \nconsistent and comprehensive framework for managing \nliquidity and funding risk across the Firm.

The heightened legal and \nregulatory focus on the financial services and banking \nindustries globally presents a continuing business challenge \nfor us.\nClimate Risk\nClimate change manifests as physical and transition risks. The \nphysical risks of climate change include acute events, such as \nflooding, hurricanes,  heatwaves  and wildfires, and chronic, \nlonger-term shifts in climate patterns, such as increasing \nglobal average temperatures , rising sea levels , and drought s. \nTransition risks are policy, legal, technological, and market \nchanges to address climate risks and include changes in \nconsumer behavior, shareholder preferences, and any \nadditional regulatory and legislative requirements, such as \ncarbon taxes.\nClimate risk, which is not expected to have a significant effect \non our consolidated results of operations or financial \ncondition in the near-term, is an overarching risk that can \nimpact other categories of risk over the longer-term. Physical \nrisk may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing \nborrowers\u2019 repayment capacity or impacting the value of \ncollateral. In addition, physical risk could pose increased \noperational risk to our facilities and people. The impacts of \ntransition risk may lead to and amplify credit risk or market \nrisk by reducing our customers\u2019 operating income or the value \nof their assets as well as expos ing us to reputational and/or \nlitigation risk due to increased legal and regulatory scrutiny or \nnegative public sentiment.\nAs climate risk is interconnected with other risk types, \nincluding geopolitical risks, we have developed and continue \nto enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations \ninto our risk management strategies, established for risks such \nas market, credit and operational risks, as well as our \ngovernance structures. The BRC oversees Firmwide risks, \nwhich include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, \nreceives updates on our risk management approach to climate \nrisk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and \nintegration of climate risk into our existing risk management \nprocesses. Our climate risk management efforts are overseen \nby the Climate Risk Committee, which is co-chaired by our \nChief Risk Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer and shapes our approach to managing climate-related risks in line \nwith our overall risk framework .

Significant Accounting Policies  \nRevenue Reco gnition\nRevenues are recognized when the promised goods or \nservices are delivered to our customers in an amount that is \nbased on the consideration the Firm expects to receive in \nexchange for those goods or services when such amounts are \nnot probable of significant reversal. \nInvestment Banking\nRevenues from investment banking activities consist of \nrevenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and \nfixed income securities and loan syndications, and advisory \nfees, primarily for mergers, acquisitions and restructurings. \nUnderwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date \nif there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount \nto be paid. Underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in \nthe relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related \nunderwriting revenues are recorded.\nAdvisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the \nclient, based on the estimated progress of work and when \nrevenues are not probable of a significant reversal. Advisory \ncosts are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest \nexpenses line items, including those reimbursed.Commissions and Fees\nCommission and fee revenues generally result from \ntransaction-based arrangements in which the client is charged \na fee for the execution of transactions. Such revenues \nprimarily arise from transactions in equity securities; services \nrelated to sales and trading  activities; and sales of mutual \nfunds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and \noptions, as well as revenues from order flow payments for \ndirecting customer orders to broker-dealers , exchanges, and \nmarket centers for execution. Commission and fee revenues \nare recognized on trade date when the performance obligation \nis satisfied.\nAsset Management Revenues\nAsset management, distribution and administration fees are \ngenerally based on related asset levels being managed, such as \nthe AUM of a customer\u2019s account or the net asset value of a \nfund. These fees are generally recognized when services are \nperformed and the fees become known. Management fees are \nreduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, \nprovided to the customer.\nPerformance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are \nrecorded when the annual performance target is met and the \nrevenues are not probable of a significant reversal.\nSales commissions paid by the Firm in connection with the \nsale of certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund \nproducts are accounted for as deferred commission assets and \namortized to expense over the expected life of the contract. \nThe Firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for \nrecoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in \nfuture periods. Other asset management and distribution costs \nare recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest \nexpenses line items.\nCarried Interest\nThe Firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees in the \nform of carried interest when the return in certain funds \nexceeds specified performance targets. When the Firm earns \ncarried interest from funds as specified performance \nthresholds are met, that carried interest and any related \ngeneral or limited partner interest are  accounted for under the \nequity method of accounting and measured based on the \nFirm\u2019s claim on the NAV of the fund at the reporting date, \ntaking into account the distribution terms applicable to the \ninterest held.

Contract liabilities are recognized in Other liabilities \nwhen the Firm has collected payment from a customer based \non the terms of the contrac t but the underlying performance \nobligations are not yet satisfied.\nFor contracts with a term of less than one year, incremental \ncosts to obtain the contract are expensed as incurred. \nRevenues are not discounted when payment is expected \nwithin one year.\nThe Firm generally presents, net within revenues, taxes \nassessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed \non and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing \ntransaction and collected by the Firm from a customer.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of Cash and due from \nbanks and Interest bearing deposits with banks. Cash \nequivalents are highly liquid investments with remaining \nmaturities of three months or less from the acquisition date \nthat are readily convertible to cash and are not held for trading \npurposes.\nCash and cash equivalents also include Restricted cash such \nas cash segregated in compliance with federal or other \nregulations, including minimum reserve requirements set by \nthe Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks, and the \nFirm\u2019s initial margin deposited with clearing organizations .\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nInstruments within Trading assets and Trading liabilities are \nmeasured at fair value, either as required or allowed by \naccounting guidance. These financial instruments primarily \nrepresent the Firm\u2019s trading and investment positions and \ninclude both cash and derivative products. In addition, \nsecurities classified as Available-for-Sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) are \nmeasured at fair value.\nGains and losses on instruments carried at fair value are \nreflected in Trading revenues, Investments revenues or \nInvestment banking revenues in the income statement, except \nfor gains and losses related to AFS securities (see \u201cAFS \nInvestment Securities\u201d section herein and Note 8 ) and \nderivatives accounted for as hedg es, as well as economic  \nderivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments  \n(see \u201cHedge Accounting\u201d and \u201cOther Hedges\u201d herein and \nNote 7 ).\nInterest income and interest expense are recorded within the \nincome statement depending on the nature of the instrument \nand related market conventions. When interest is included as a \ncomponent of the instruments\u2019 fair value, interest is recorded \nwithin Trading revenues or Investments revenues.

Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions \nthe Firm believes other market participants would use in \npricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the \nbest information available in the circumstances. The fair value \nhierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the \nobservability of inputs as follows, with Level 1 being the \nhighest and Level 3 being the lowest level:\nLevel 1.   Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets \nthat the Firm has the ability to access for identical assets or \nliabilities. Valuation adjustments, block discounts and \ndiscounts for entity-specific restrictions that would not \ntransfer to market participants are not applied to Level 1 \ninstruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that \nare readily and regularly available in an active market, \nvaluation of these products does not entail a significant degree \nof judgment.\nLevel 2.   Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in \nmarkets that are not active or for which all significant inputs \nare observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3.   Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and \nsignificant to the overall fair value measurement.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from product to \nproduct and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including \nthe type of product, whether the product is new and not yet \nestablished in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and \nother characteristics particular to the product. To the extent \nthat valuation is based on models or inputs that are less \nobservable or unobservable in the market, the determination \nof fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree \nof judgment exercised by the Firm in determining fair value is \ngreatest for instruments categorized in Level 3 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy.\nThe Firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the \nmeasurement date, including during periods of market \ndislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability \nof prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. \nThis condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified \nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall \ninto different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, \nthe total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate \nfor the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair \nvalue of the asset or liability.\nValuation Techniques\nMany cash instruments and OTC derivative contracts have bid \nand ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid \nprices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for \nan asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is \nwilling to accept for an asset. The Firm carries positions at the \npoint within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of \nfair value. For offsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to \nmeasure both the long and short positions.\nFair value for many cash instruments and OTC derivative \ncontracts is derived using pricing models. Pricing models take \ninto account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, \nincluding, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, \ninterest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, \ncreditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the \nFirm, option volatility and currency rates.\nWhere appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account \nfor various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask \nadjustments), credit quality, model uncertain ty, and \nconcentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value . \nAdjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived mid-\nmarket amounts of Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments \nfor the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflect \nthe exit price of a risk position. Bid-mid and mid-ask spreads \nare marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotes \nor other external third-party data. Where these spreads are \nunobservable for the particular position in question, spreads \nare derived from observable levels of similar positions.\nThe Firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its \nBorrowings for which the fair value option was elected and to \nOTC derivatives.

The methodology \nfor measuring FVA leverages the Firm\u2019s existing credit-\nrelated valuation adjustment calculation methodologies, \nwhich apply to both assets and liabilities.\nSee Note 5  for a description of valuation techniques applied to \nthe major categories of financial instruments measured at fair \nvalue.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-\nrecurring Basis\nCertain of the Firm\u2019s assets and liabilities are measured at fair \nvalue on a non-recurring basis. The Firm incurs losses or \ngains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair \nvalue.\nFor assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis, fair value is determined by using various \nvaluation approaches. The same hierarchy for inputs as \ndescribed above, which requires that observable inputs be \nused when available, is used in measuring fair value for these \nitems.\nFor further information on financial assets and liabilities that \nare measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring \nbasis, see Note 5 .\nOffsetting of Derivative Instruments\nIn connection with its derivative activities, the Firm generally \nenters into master netting agreements and collateral \nagreements with its counterparties. These agreements provide \nthe Firm with the right, in the event of a default by the \ncounterparty, to net a counterparty\u2019s rights and obligations \nunder the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash \ncollateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty. \nDerivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are \nreported net of cash collateral received and posted.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, the Firm may not have \nsuch an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime \nmay not support the enforceability of the master netting \nagreement or collateral agreement; or the Firm may not have \nsought legal advice to support the enforceability of the \nagreement. In cases where the Firm has not determined an \nagreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not \noffset (see Note 7 ).\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is generally to receive cash and/or \nsecurities posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), \nirrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the master netting and collateral agreement. In certain cases, the \nFirm may agree for such collateral to be posted to a third-\nparty custodian under a control agreement that enables it to \ntake control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty \ndefault. The enforceability of the master netting agreement is \ntaken into account in the Firm\u2019s risk management practices \nand application of counterparty credit limits.\nFor information related to offsetting of derivatives, see Note \n7.\nHedge Accounting\nThe Firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative \nfinancial instruments for the following types of hedges: \nhedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due \nto the risk being hedged (fair value hedges);  hedges of \nvariability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets \ndue to contractually specified interest rates (cash flow h edges) \nand hedges of net investments in foreign operations whose \nfunctional currency is different from the reporting currency of \nthe Parent Company  (net investment hedges). These financial \ninstruments are included within Trading assets\u2014Derivative \nand other contracts or Trading liabilities\u2014Derivative and \nother contracts in the balance sheet. For hedges where hedge \naccounting is being applied, the Firm performs effectiveness \ntesting and other procedures.

The forward points on the hedging instruments \nare excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and changes in \nthe fair value of this excluded component are recorded \ncurrently in Interest income.\nCash Flow Hedges\u2014Interest Rate Risk\nThe Firm\u2019s designated cash flow hedges consist of interest \nrate derivatives designated as hedges of variability in \nforecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets due to changes \nin the contractually specified interest rates. The Firm uses \nregression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and \nretrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging \nrelationships. \nThe objective of this strategy is to hedge the risk of changes \nin the hedged item\u2019s cash flows attributable to changes in the \ncontractually specified interest rate. For qualifying cash flow \nhedges  of contractually specified interest rates, changes in the \nfair value of the derivative are  recorded in OCI and \nsubsequently reclassified to earnings  in the same periods \nwhen the hedged item affects earnings. If cash flow hedge \naccounting is discontinued, AOCI is released into earnings \nimmediately if the  cash flow of the hedge d item is probable  of \nnot occurring . Otherwise the amount in AOCI is released into \nearnings as the forecasted transaction affects earn ings.\nOther Hedges\nIn addition to hedges that are designated and qualify for hedge \naccounting, the Firm uses  derivative s to economically  hedge  \ncredit risk associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-\ninvestment corporate loans and lending commitments, and the \nrelated gains and losses are reported within Other revenues in \nthe income statement.\nFor further information on derivative instruments and hedging \nactivities, see Note 7 .\nAFS Investment Securities\nAFS securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheet. \nInterest income, including amortization of premiums and \naccretion of discounts, is included in Interest income in the income statement. Unrealized gains are recorded in OC I, and \nunrealized losses are  recorded either in OCI or in Other \nrevenues as described below.\nAFS securities in an unrealized loss position are first \nevaluated to determine whether there is an intent to sell or it is \nmore likely than not the Firm will be required to sell before \nrecovery of the amortized cost basis. If so, the amortized cost \nbasis is written down to the fair value of the security such that \nthe entire unrealized loss is recognized in Other revenu es, and \nany previously established ACL is written off.\nFor all other AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, any \nportion of unrealized losses representing a credit loss is \nrecognized in Other revenues and as an increase to the ACL \nfor AFS securities, with the remainder of unrealized losses \nrecognized in OCI.

The \nFirm uses three forecasts that include assumptions about \ncertain macroeconomic variabl es, including, but not limited \nto, U.S. gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d), equity market \nindices and unemployment rates, as well as commercial real \nestate and home price indices. At the conclusion of the Firm\u2019s \nreasonable and supportable forecast period of 13 quarters, \nthere is a gradual reversion back to historical averages.\nThe ACL is measured on a collective basis when similar risk \ncharacteristics exist for multiple instrumen ts, considering all \navailable information relevant to assessing the collectability \nof cash flows. Generally, the Firm applies a probability of \ndefault/loss given default model for instruments that are \ncollectively assessed, under which the ACL is calculated as \nthe product of probability of default, loss given default and \nexposure at default. These parameters are forecast for each \ncollective group of assets using a scenario-based statistical \nmodel.\nIf the instrument does not share similar risk characteristics \nwith other instruments, including when it is probable that the \nFirm will be unable to collect the full payment of principal \nand interest on the instrument when due, the ACL is measured \non an individual basis. The Firm generally applies a \ndiscounted cash flow method for instruments that are \nindividually assessed.\nThe Firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the \nfair value of the collateral when measuring the ACL if the \nloan is collateral dependent ( i.e., repayment of the loan is \nexpected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation \nof the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing \nfinancial difficulty).\nAdditionally, the Firm can elect to use an approach to \nmeasure the ACL that considers  the fair value of collateral \nwhere the borrower is required to, and reasonably expected to, \ncontinually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral \nsecuring the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of \nsuch collateral. The Firm has elected to use this approach for \ncertain securities-based loans, margin loans, s ecurities \npurchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed.\nCredit quality indicators considered in developing the ACL \ninclude:\n\u2022Corporate loans, s ecured lending facilities, commercial real \nestate loans and securities, and other loans: Internal risk \nratings developed by the CRM that are refreshed at least \nannually, and more frequently as necessary. These ratings \ngenerally correspond to external ratings published by S&P. \nThe Firm also considers transaction structure, including \ntype of collateral, collateral terms and position of the \nobligation within the capital structure. In addition, for \ncommercial real estate, the Firm considers property type and location, net operating income and LTV ratios, among \nother factors, as well as commercial real estate price and \ncredit spread indices and capitalization rates.\n\u2022Residential real estate loans: Loan origination Fair Isaac \nCorporation (\u201cFICO\u201d) credit scores as determined by \nindependent credit agencies in the U.S. and LTV ratios.\n\u2022Employee loans: Employment status, which includes those \ncurrently employed by the Firm and for which the Firm can \ndeduct any unpaid amounts due to it through certain \ncompensation arrangements; and those no longer employed \nby the Firm where such arrangements are no longer \napplicable . \nQualitative and environmental factors such as economic and \nbusiness conditions, the nature and volume of the portfolio, \nand lending terms and the volume and severity of past due \nloans are also considered in the ACL calculations.\nPresentation of ACL and Provision for Credit Loss es\nACLProvision for \nCredit Losses\nHeld for investment loans Contra assetProvision for credit \nlosses\nOther instruments measured at \namortized cost ( e.g., HTM securities \nand customer and other receivables)Contra asset Other revenues\nEmployee loans Contra assetCompensation and \nbenefits expenses\nHeld for investment lending \ncommitmentsOther liabilities and \naccrued expensesProvision for credit \nlosses\nOther off-balance sheet instruments \n(e.g., certain guarantees)Other liabilities and \naccrued expensesOther expenses\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nThe Firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic \nor legal reasons related to a borrower\u2019s financial difficulties \nby granting one or more concessions that the Firm would not \notherwise consider .

The Firm determines the fair value of \nRSUs (including PSUs with non-market performance \nconditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common \nstock, measured as the volume-weighted average price on the \ndate of grant (\u201cVWAP\u201d). The fair value of RSUs not entitled \nto dividends until conversion is measured at VWAP reduced \nby the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the \nunderlying shares prior to scheduled conversion date.

Compensation \nexpense for awards with market-based conditions is \nrecognized irrespective of the probability of the market condition being achieved and is not reversed if the market \ncondition is not met. The Firm accounts for forfeitures as they \noccur.\nStock-based awards generally contain clawback and \ncancellation provisions. Certain awards provide the Firm \ndiscretion to claw back or cancel all or a portion of the award \nunder specified circumstances. Compensation expense for \nthose awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the \nFirm\u2019s common stock or the relevant model valuation, as \nappropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration.

Following the grant of an RSU award, when a stock \ntrust is utilized, the Firm contributes shares to be held in the \nstock trust until the RSUs convert to common shares. The \nassets of the employee stock trusts are consolidated with those \nof the Firm and are generally accounted for in a manner \nsimilar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stock \noutstanding reported in Common stock issued to employee \nstock trusts are offset by an equal amount reported in \nEmployee stock trusts in the balance sheet.\nThe Firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based \ncompensation as the basis for recording the movement of the \nassets to or from the employee stock trusts.

For information on performance-\nbased fees in the form of carried interest, which are directly \nrelated to carried interest compensation, see \u201cRevenue \nRecognition\u2014Carried Interest\u201d herein.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the \ntemporary differences between the financial statement and \nincome tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently \nenacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences \nare expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax \nexpense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment \ndate. Such effects are recorded in Provision for income tax es \nregardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded.\nThe Firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that \nit believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. \nIn making such a determination, the Firm considers all \navailable positive and negative evidence, including future \nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected \nfuture taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of \nrecent operations. When performing the assessment, the Firm \nconsiders all types of deferred tax assets in combination with \neach other, regardless of the origin of the underlying \ntemporary difference. If a deferred tax asset is determined to \nbe unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. If the \nFirm subsequently determines that it would be able to realize \ndeferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, it \nwould make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation \nallowance, which would reduce the provision for income \ntaxes.\nThe Firm recognizes tax expense associated with Global \nIntangible Low-Taxed Income as it is incurred as part of the \ncurrent income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current \nperiod.\nUncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step \nprocess, whereby (i) the Firm determines whether it is more \nlikely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the \nbasis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those \ntax positions that meet this threshold, the Firm recognizes the \nlargest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be \nrealized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax \nbenefits are recognized as a component of the provision for \nincome taxes.\nForeign Currencies\nAssets and liabilities of operations with non-U.S. dollar \nfunctional currencies are translated at year-end rates of \nexchange. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign \ncurrency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and \nrelated tax effects, are reflected in AOCI in the balance sheet. \nGains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign \ncurrency transactions are included in net income, and amounts \nrecognized in the income statement are translated at the rate \nof exchange on the respective date of recognition for each \namount.\nAccounting Update  Adopted in 2022\nReference Rate Reform\nThe Firm has adopted the Reference Rate Reform accounting \nupdate, which  extends the period of time entities can utilize \nthe reference rate reform relief guidance from December 31, \n2022 to December 31, 2024.

Many pricing models do not entail material \nsubjectivity as the methodologies employed do not \nnecessitate significant judgment since model inputs may \nbe observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case \nfor generic interest rate swaps, many equity, commodity \nand foreign currency option contracts, and certain CDS. In \nthe case of more established derivative products, the \npricing models used by the Firm are widely accepted by \nthe financial services industry. \n\u2022More complex OTC derivative products are typically less \nliquid and require more judgment in the implementation of \nthe valuation technique since direct trading activity or \nquotes are unobservable. This includes certain types of \ninterest rate derivatives with both volatility and correlation \nexposure, equity, commodity or foreign currency \nderivatives that are either longer-dated or include exposure \nto multiple underlyings, and credit derivatives, including \nCDS on certain mortgage- or asset-backed securities and \nbasket CDS. Where required inputs are unobservable, \nrelationships to observable data points, based on historical \nand/or implied observations, may be employed as a \ntechnique to estimate the model input values.

These investments are included in the Fund \nInterests table in the \u201cNet Asset Value Measurements\u201d \nsection herein. \n\u2022For non-exchange-traded investments either held directly \nor held within internally managed funds, fair value after \ninitial recognition is based on an assessment of each \nunderlying investment, considering rounds of financing \nand third-party transactions, discounted cash flow analyses \nand market-based information, including comparable Firm \ntransactions, trading multiples and changes in market \noutlook, among other factors. \nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\u2022Level 1\u2014if actively traded\n\u2022Level 2\u2014when not actively traded and valued based on \nrounds of financing or third-party transactions\n\u2022Level 3\u2014when not actively traded and rounds of \nfinancing or third-party transactions are not available \nPhysical Commodities\nValuation Techniques:. \n\u2022Fair value is determined using observable inputs, \nincluding broker quotations and published indices. \nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\u2022Level 2\u2014valued using observable inputs\nInvestment Securities\u2014AFS Securities\nValuation Techniques:\n\u2022AFS securities are composed of U.S. government and \nagency securities ( e.g., U.S. Treasury securities, agency-\nissued debt, agency mortgage pass-through securities and \nCMOs), CMBS, ABS, state and municipal securities.

Alternatively, a \nprice-to-price basis can be assumed between the \ncomparable instrument and the bond or loan being valued in \norder to establish the value of the bond or loan.\n\u2022Comparable E quity  Price.  A price derived from equity \nraises, share buybacks and external bid levels, etc. A \ndiscount or premium may be included in the fair value \nestimate.\n\u2022Contingency P robability.  Probability associated with the \nrealization of an underlying event upon which the value of \nan asset is contingent.\n\u2022EBITDA M ultiple /Exit Multip le. The ratio of Enterprise \nValue to EBITDA, where enterprise value is the aggregate \nvalue of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. \nThe EBITDA multiple reflects the value of  a company  in \nterms of its full-year EBITDA, whereas the exit multiple \nreflects the value of  a company  in terms of its full-year \nexpected EBITDA at exit. Either multiple allows \ncomparison between companies from an operational \nperspective as the effect of capital structure, taxation and \ndepreciation/amortization is excluded.\nAn increase (decrease) to the following significant \nunobservable inputs would generally result in a lower (higher) \nfair value.\n\u2022Cash -Synthetic Basis. The measure of the price differential \nbetween cash financial instruments and their synthetic \nderivative-based equivalents. The range disclosed in the \nprevious table signifies the number of points by which the \nsynthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quoted \nprice of the underlying cash bonds.\n\u2022Funding S pread.

The annualized rate that reflects the \npossibility of losses as a result of movements in the price of \nthe underlying margin loan collateral. The rate is calibrated \nfrom the discount rate, credit spreads and/or volatility \nmeasures.\n\u2022WACC.  WACC represents the theoretical rate of return \nrequired to debt and equity investors. The WACC is used in \na discounted cash flow model that calculates the value of \nthe equity. The model assumes that the cash flow \nassumptions, including projections, are fully reflected in the \ncurrent equity value, while the debt to equity ratio is held \nconstant.\nAn increase (decrease) to the following significant \nunobservable inputs would generally result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact \nwould depend on whether the Firm is long or short the \nexposure.\n\u2022Correlation.  A pricing input where the payoff is driven by \nmore than one underlying risk. Correlation is a measure of \nthe relationship between the movement of two variables \n(i.e., how the change in one variable influences a change in \nthe other variable).\n\u2022Credit S pread. The credit spread reflects  the additional net \nyield an investor can earn from a security with more credit \nrisk relative to one with less credit risk. The credit spread of \na particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield \non a credit risk-free benchma rk security or reference rate .\n\u2022Interest Rate C urve. The term structure of interest rates \n(relationship between interest rates and the time to \nmaturity) and a market\u2019s measure of future interest rates at \nthe time of observation. An interest rate curve is used to set \ninterest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and \nis a pricing input used in the discounting of any OTC \nderivative cash flow.\n\u2022Volatility.  The measure of variability in possible returns for \nan instrument given how much that instrument changes in \nvalue over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options , \nand, generally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the \noption. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a \nparticular option depends on a number of factors, including \nthe nature of the risk underlying that option, the tenor and \nthe strike price of the option.\n\u2022Volatility S kew. The measure of the difference in implied \nvolatility for options with identical underliers and expiry \ndates but with different strikes.Table of Contents  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 2022 Form 10-K 98", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4414, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09e00a9c-309c-4b23-adad-55c672eed9f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "09e00a9c-309c-4b23-adad-55c672eed9f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0c75664-4d83-4f7b-aa61-306a6d4d38bb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8d980a0206b1a17ba0c9b0ef1282b04f52f6ceeddb69a63add926f550887e9c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8644ea58-63b4-412b-8679-547233f761f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a2d827d65e35bfd13bccb69ab455307f76587dcbc6cfe3c4e9261d3de499e8ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "66678c18-3ded-46b4-93d5-863d1c3c581b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc492405dffe9e9302b7c0418680869dcf77c4b5bbc98d9e75b7dbbd35e59801", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a80bf4b9a11db3f68c552c8463159ebedf05db0479df4591f7a6ee3442f4a524", "text": "Net Asset Value Measurements\nFund Interests  \n At December 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021\n$ in millionsCarrying\nValue CommitmentCarrying\nValue Commitment\nPrivate equity $ 2,622 $ 638 $ 2,492 $ 615 \nReal estate  2,642  239  2,064  248 \nHedge1 190  3  191  2 \nTotal $ 5,454 $ 880 $ 4,747 $ 865 \n1.Investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate \nprovisions, which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a \ncertain initial period or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, \nrespectively.  \nAmounts in the previous table represent the Firm\u2019s carrying \nvalue of general and limited partnership interests in fund \ninvestments, as well as any related performance-based income \nin the form of carried interest.

The Firm manages its exposure to these \nderivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation \nstrategies, which include managing the credit and correlation \nrisk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, \ntranched indices and baskets, and cash positions.

A CDS protects the buyer against the loss \nof principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the \nissuer. The protection buyer pays a periodic premium \n(generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is \nprotected for the period. The Firm, in turn, performs under a \nCDS if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. \nTypical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or \ninsolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and \nrestructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.\nIndex and Basket CDS.   Index and basket CDS are products \nwhere credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-\nname CDS. Generally, in the event of a default on one of the \nunderlying names, the Firm pays a pro rata portion of the total \nnotional amount of the CDS.\nThe Firm also enters into tranched index and basket CDS \nwhere credit protection is provided on a particular portion of \nthe portfolio loss distribution.

For  non-credit derivative contracts that meet \nthe accounting definition of a guarantee  the notional amount \nis used as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative \ncontracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign \ncurrency options. The Firm evaluates collateral requirements \nfor all derivatives, including derivatives that do not meet the \naccounting definition of a guarantee. For the effects of cash \ncollateral and counterparty netting, see Note 7 .\nIn certain situations, collateral may be held by the Firm for \nthose contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee. \nGenerally, the Firm sets collateral requirements by \ncounterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions \nand products and is not allocated specifically to individual \ncontracts. Also, the Firm may recover amounts related to the \nunderlying asset delivered to the Firm under the derivative \ncontract.\nStandby Letters of Credit and Other Financial Guarantees \nIssued.  In connection with its corporate lending business and \nother corporate activities, the Firm provides standby letters of \ncredit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. Such \narrangements represent obligations to make payments to third \nparties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a \nborrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. A \nmajority of the Firm\u2019s standby letters of credit are provided \non behalf of counterparties that are investment grade. If the \ncounterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the Firm \nhas access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its \nobligation.Market Value Guarantees.  Market value guarantees are issued \nto guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors \nin certain affordable housing tax credit funds.

As a general partner in certain \ninvestment management funds, the Firm receives certain \ndistributions from the partnerships when the return exceeds \nspecified performance targets according to the provisions of \nthe partnership agreements. The Firm may be required to \nreturn all or a portion of such distributions to the limited \npartners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a \ncertain return as specified in the various partnership \nagreements, subject to certain limitations.\nClient Clearing Guarantees.  The Firm is  a sponsoring \nmember of the Government Securities Division of the FICC's \nSponsored Clearing Model. Clients of the Firm, as sponsored \nmembers, can transact in overnight  and term securities  \nrepurchase and resale agreements,  which are cleared through \nthe FICC. As sponsoring member, the Firm guarantees to the \nFICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its \nclients\u2019 obligations. In 2020, the FICC\u2019s sponsored clearing \nmodel was updated such that the Firm could be responsible \nfor liquidation of a sponsored member\u2019s account and \nguarantees any resulting loss to the FICC in the event the \nsponsored member fails to fully pay any net liquidation \namount due from the sponsored member to the FICC. \nAccordingly, the Firm\u2019s maximum potential payout amount \nreflects the total of the estimated net liquidation amounts for \nsponsored member accounts. The Firm minimizes credit \nexposure under this guarantee by obtaining a security interest \nin its sponsored member clients\u2019 collateral and their \ncontractual rights under sponsored member transactions. \nTherefore, the Firm's exposure is estimated to be an amount \nsubstantially lower than the maximum potential payout \namount. The collateral amount in which the Firm has a \nsecurity interest is approximately equal to the maximum \npotential payout amount of the guarantee.\nOther Guarantees and Indemnities\nIn the normal course of business, the Firm provides \nguarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. \nThese provisions generally are standard contractual terms. \nCertain of these guarantees and indemnifications are \ndescribed below:\n\u2022Indemnities . The Firm provides standard indemnities to \ncounterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, \nincluding U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest \nand other payments made on derivatives, securities and \nstock lending transactions, certain annuity products and \nother financial arrangements. These indemnity payments \ncould be required based on a change in the tax laws, a \nchange in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a \nchange in factual circumstances. Certain contracts contain \nprovisions that enable the Firm to terminate the agreement \nupon the occurrence of such events.  The Firm may also \nprovide indemnities when  it sells a business or assets to a third-party, pursuant to which it indemnifies the third-party \nfor losses incurred on assets acquired or liabilities assumed \nor due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the \nbusiness or assets. The Firm expects the risk of loss \nassociated with indemnities related to the sale of businesses \nor assets to be remote.  The maximum potential amount of \nfuture payments that the Firm could be required to make \nunder these indemnifications cannot be estimated.\n\u2022Exchange/Clearinghouse Member Guarantees.  The Firm is \na member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that \ntrade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. \nAssociated with its membership, the Firm may be required \nto pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or \nthe clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members \nor pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of \nanother member that may default on its obligations to the \nexchange or the clearinghouse. While the rules governing \ndifferent exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the \nforms of these guarantees may vary, in general the Firm\u2019s \nobligations under these rules would arise only if the \nexchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its \nresources.\nIn addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to \nassume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the \nclearinghouse\u2019s investment of guarantee fund contributions \nand initial margin  and of other losses unrelated to the \ndefault of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the \nspecified resources allocated for such purpose by the \nclearinghouse.\nThe maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be \nestimated. The Firm has not recorded any contingent \nliability in its financial statements for these agreements and \nbelieves that any potential requirement to make payments \nunder these agreements is remote.\n\u2022Merger and Acquisition Guarantees.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4951, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b57420ac-53d6-4313-9a62-57c09a061341": {"__data__": {"id_": "b57420ac-53d6-4313-9a62-57c09a061341", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f889d516-31f4-42fe-8fce-c724e670dbad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "efa843b8359c7c9881babc7aa59cbc6ec394857220a2db688da2d09953108144", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7aebf19-c0ca-4f9e-8c9a-8103c6050ed6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b2bcc769791b627022e02284c5d187cf5d687c9bfac4b8c6f4095c45c2c9f416", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6717b86d-0f41-4ee3-b83a-d88dc361b8e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5edb6bd88431be211de7562f78e22035871681d60ba37e92e5988371f53b04a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3bfb86561041ec2093c33d70d70c084da2ea566188e7c62d069188b03d5b3f27", "text": "While the rules governing \ndifferent exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the \nforms of these guarantees may vary, in general the Firm\u2019s \nobligations under these rules would arise only if the \nexchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its \nresources.\nIn addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to \nassume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the \nclearinghouse\u2019s investment of guarantee fund contributions \nand initial margin  and of other losses unrelated to the \ndefault of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the \nspecified resources allocated for such purpose by the \nclearinghouse.\nThe maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be \nestimated.

On January 29, 2021, the Advocate \nGeneral of the Dutch High Court issued an advisory opinion \non the Firm\u2019s appeal, which rejected the Firm\u2019s principal \ngrounds of appeal. On February 11, 2021, the Firm and the \nDutch Authority each responded to this opinion. On June 22, \n2021, Dutch criminal authorities sought various documents in \nconnection with an investigation of the Firm related to the \ncivil claims asserted by the Dutch Authority concerning the \naccuracy of the Firm subsidiary\u2019s tax returns and the \nmaintenance of its books and records for 2007 to 2012.\n16. Variable Interest Entities and Securitization \nActivities  \nOverview\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course \nof business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be \nVIEs.\nThe Firm\u2019s variable interests in VIEs include debt and equity \ninterests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments \nand certain fees. The Firm\u2019s involvement with VIEs arises \nprimarily from:\n\u2022Interests purchased in connection with market-making \nactivities, securities held in its Investment securities \nportfolio and retained interests held as a result of \nsecuritization activities, including re-securitization \ntransactions.\n\u2022Guarantees issued and residual interests retained in \nconnection with municipal bond securitizations.\n\u2022Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, \nequity, real estate or other assets.\n\u2022Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n\u2022Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaging notes \ndesigned to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n\u2022Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-\nefficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a \nVIE upon its initial involvement with the VIE and reassesses \nwhether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as \nlong as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This \ndetermination is based upon an analysis of the design of the \nVIE, including the VIE\u2019s structure and activities, the power to \nmake significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by \nother parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and \nother parties.\nThe power to make the most significant economic decisions \nmay take a number of different forms in different types of \nVIEs. The Firm considers servicing or collateral management \ndecisions as representing the power to make the most \nsignificant economic decisions in transactions such as \nsecuritizations or CDOs. As a result, the Firm does not \nconsolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act \nas the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to \nrequire the liquidation of the entity. If the Firm serves as \nservicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights \ndescribed in the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the \ninterests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates only those \nVIEs for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the \nVIE.\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, \nCLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no \nsignificant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In \nthese cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made \nprior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the \ntermination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of \nthese transactions that decisions made prior to the initial \nclosing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors \nbased upon the nature of the assets, including whether the \nassets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the Firm and \nthe extent of the information available to the Firm and to \ninvestors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, \nother rights held by the Firm and investors, the \nstandardization of the legal documentation and the level of \ncontinuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount \nand type of interests owned by the Firm and by other \ninvestors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right \nheld by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the \nVIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other \nasset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.Table of Contents  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n119 December 2022 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4385, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cadefd5b-36c4-4ee5-a024-049b919409f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "cadefd5b-36c4-4ee5-a024-049b919409f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f55759b4-42c0-4e26-a3fd-ae93123f9e6a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e8d54723ca88cf242c985ceea528b01a2c682342c1d22b6811954809b9917c0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "43f544ba-a08a-4b49-a5f3-5b976363202f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2def299955416fb4906f6f75cb38336290c645e98c70267a91cd10ddcc84140c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0f23d22-e216-45b2-a987-fa1271e789c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a8a166908ec8222b99f341f25c9b52b3d4a49890df05b3fd49d8d9ab1752037", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "08f8b4ed487e061ed1bc71db9496f9d2605acdc2473619adb19a944eff328170", "text": "Consolidated VIE Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\n At December 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021\n$ in millions VIE Assets VIE Liabilities VIE Assets VIE Liabilities\nMABS1$ 1,153 $ 520 $ 1,177 $ 409 \nInvestment vehicles2 638  272  717  294 \nOperating entities  1  \u2014  508  39 \nOther  889  521  510  286 \nTotal $ 2,681 $ 1,313 $ 2,912 $ 1,028 \n1.Amounts include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial \nmortgage loans and other types of assets, including consumer or commercial \nassets and may be in loan or security form.

The Firm does not provide additional support \nin these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives.\nThe previous tables include VIEs sponsored by unrelated \nparties, as well as VIEs sponsored by the Firm; examples of \nthe Firm\u2019s involvement with these VIEs include its secondary \nmarket-making activities and the securities held in its \nInvestment securities portfolio (see Note 8 ).\nThe Firm\u2019s maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the \nnature of the Firm\u2019s variable interest in the VIE and is limited \nto the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other \ncredit support, total return swaps and written put options, as \nwell as the fair value of certain other derivatives and \ninvestments the Firm has made in the VIE.\nThe Firm\u2019s maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables \ndoes not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any \nreductions associated with the amount of collateral held as Table of Contents  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 2022 Form 10-K 120", "start_char_idx": 4133, "end_char_idx": 5621, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a69177a-bd38-4463-971e-46fc38927679": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a69177a-bd38-4463-971e-46fc38927679", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11d4fd95-7344-4545-b293-6d017186b4da", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4eabec004ba8c3ac15ab23e9202a2e9ebe9d17406ba219fe271def401089c478", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e335812c-6065-4a0a-97f1-061bafc92b19", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "99f780850d3d6c4dab7701b2d91d50284dfc4cbe80e1f5301e599f31f601ded5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3aeeffb0-28d2-4458-8369-8e8a68272a99", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bd93f3a7523c999477e98f3d958994175e33c95d2ba504512fac949ca4337ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "81513919bcea39a175756a9d0f6c20d1dcb6137e446e8a08354539a111257665", "text": "part of a transaction with the VIE or any party to the VIE \ndirectly against a specific exposure to loss.\nLiabilities issued by VIEs generally are non-recourse to the \nFirm.\nDetail of Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securitization Assets\n At December 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021\n$ in millions UPBDebt and\nEquity\nInterests UPBDebt and\nEquity\nInterests\nResidential mortgages $ 20,428 $ 2,570 $ 15,216 $ 2,182 \nCommercial mortgages  67,540  4,236  68,503  4,092 \nU.S. agency collateralized \nmortgage obligations  32,567  4,729  57,972  9,835 \nOther consumer or \ncommercial loans  3,066  1,569  4,380  1,953 \nTotal $ 123,601 $ 13,104 $ 146,071 $ 18,062 \nSecuritization Activities\nIn a securitization transaction, the Firm transfers assets \n(generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or \nsecurities) to an SPE, sells to investors most of the beneficial \ninterests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the SPE, and, \nin many cases, retains other beneficial interests. The purchase \nof the transferred assets by the SPE is financed through the \nsale of these interests.\nIn many securitization transactions involving commercial \nmortgage loans, the Firm transfers a portion of the assets to \nthe SPE with unrelated parties transferring the remaining \nassets. In addition, mainly in securitization transactions \ninvolving residential mortgage loans, the Firm may also enter \ninto derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or \ninterest rate caps, with the SPE.\nAlthough not obligated, the Firm generally makes a market in \nthe securities issued by SPEs in securitization transactions. As \na market  maker, the Firm offers to buy these securities from, \nand sell the se securities to, investors. Securities purchased \nthrough these market-making activities are not considered to \nbe retained interests; these beneficial interests generally are \nincluded in Trading assets\u2014Corporate and other debt and are \nmeasured at fair value.\nThe Firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps \nand interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many \nsecuritization transactions. The risks associated with these and \nsimilar derivatives with SPEs are essentially the same as \nsimilar derivatives with non-SPE counterparties and are \nmanaged as part of the Firm\u2019s overall exposure. See Note 7  \nfor further information on derivative instruments and hedging \nactivities.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Firm holds securities issued by VIEs within the \nInvestment securities portfolio. These securities are composed \nof those related to transactions sponsored by the federal \nmortgage agencies and predominantly the most senior securities issued by VIEs backed by student loans and \ncommercial mortgage loans. T ransactions sponsored by the \nfederal mortgage agencies include an explicit or implicit \nguarantee provided by the U.S. government.  Additionally, the \nFirm holds certain commercial mortgage-backed securities \nissued by VIEs retained as a result of the Firm's securitization \nactivities. See Note 8  for further information on the \nInvestment securities portfolio.\nMunicipal Tender Option Bond Trusts\nIn a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client \ntransfers a municipal bond to a trust. The trust issues short-\nterm securities that the Firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to \ninvestors. The client generally retains a residual interest. The \nshort-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility \npursuant to which the investors may put their short-term \ninterests. In most programs, a third-party provider will \nprovide such liquidity facility; in some programs, the Firm \nprovides this liquidity facility.\nThe Firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for \nremarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. \nThe client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. \nThe liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction \nupon the occurrence of certain events. When the transaction is \nterminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to \nthe client. Any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon \nthe sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. This \nobligation is generally collateralized.

The Federal Reserve establishes \ncapital requirements for the Firm, including \u201c well-\ncapitalized \u201d standards, and evaluates the Firm\u2019s compliance \nwith such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar \ncapital requirements and standards for the Firm\u2019s U.S. bank \nsubsidiaries , including, among others, MSBNA and \nMSPBNA  (together, \u201cU.S. Bank Subsidiaries\u201d) . The \nregulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel \nIII capital standards established by the Basel Committee on \nBanking Supervision and also implement certain provisions of \nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \nAct. In addition, many of the Firm\u2019s regulated subsidiaries are \nsubject  to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated \nsubsidiaries provisionally registered as swap dealers with the \nCFTC or conditionally registered as security-based swap \ndealers with the SEC or registered as broker-dealers or futures \ncommission merchants.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and \nleverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital \nrequirements.

Risk-based capital ratio \nrequirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 \ncapital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each \nas a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum \nrequired ratios plus the Firm\u2019s capital buffer requirement. \nCapital requirements require certain adjustments to, and \ndeductions from, capital for purposes of determining these \nratios.\nCECL Deferral.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4343, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ae79ab1-14e1-41ea-ba71-eeb7f6ccb20f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ae79ab1-14e1-41ea-ba71-eeb7f6ccb20f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5ec23065-c834-46cb-acea-4fd52c63aa5f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6a9bcf8253ed4d513b3f4cedbb40a1695585be4429c872b095ce976469b9e1fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06bcc5e3-d207-4142-a274-638e0575f5d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "MS2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2395618, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "50f0145e861d9d9349be53da6062ab280e080b54d4e291cf72b3fa9d98f7c8b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0b9bbc68-6d13-44e0-b612-b2aa59d8696d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "addfd372ff1d61b909007aaac53c3df6a033be1b4f47c10c46d1a9cc146d13c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0c15a041216a6b6d0c3dd56646206d5703f9a0695fc6570f2fad3677ccaf6019", "text": "In addition, many of the Firm\u2019s regulated subsidiaries are \nsubject  to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated \nsubsidiaries provisionally registered as swap dealers with the \nCFTC or conditionally registered as security-based swap \ndealers with the SEC or registered as broker-dealers or futures \ncommission merchants.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and \nleverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital \nrequirements.

The Parent Company has issued guarantees on \nbehalf of its subsidiaries to various U.S. and non-U.S. \nexchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities \nand/or futures contracts.

The Parent Company has not recorded any \ncontingent liability in its condensed financial statements for \nthese arrangements and believes that any potential \nrequirements to make payments under these arrangements are \nremote.\nThe Parent Company also, in the normal course of business, \nprovides standard indemnities to counterparties on behalf of \nits subsidiaries for taxes, including U.S. and foreign \nwithholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on \nderivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, and \ncertain annuity products, and may also provide indemnities to \nor on behalf of affiliates from time to time for other \narrangements. These indemnity payments could be required, \nas applicable, based on a change in the tax laws, change in \ninterpretation of applicable tax rulings or claims arising from \ncontractual relationships between affiliates. Certain contracts \ncontain provisions that enable the Parent Company to \nterminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. \nThe maximum potential amount of future payments that the \nParent Company could be required to make under these \nindemnifications cannot be estimated. The Parent Company \nhas not recorded any contingent liability in its condensed \nfinancial statements for these indemnifications and believes \nthat the occurrence of any events that would trigger payments \nunder these contracts is remote.Guarantees of Debt Instruments and Warrants Issued by \nSubsidiaries\n$ in millionsAt\nDecember 31,\n2022 At\nDecember 31,\n2021 \nAggregate balance $ 51,136 $ 47,129 \nGuarantees under Subsidiary Lease Obligations\n$ in millionsAt\nDecember 31,\n2022 At\nDecember 31,\n2021 \nAggregate balance1$ 615 $ 610 \n1.Amounts primarily relate to the U.K.\nFinance Subsidiary\nThe Parent Company fully and unconditionally guarantees the \nsecurities issued by Morgan Stanley Finance LLC, a wholly \nowned finance subsidiary.

Our current facilities are adequate for our present \nand future operations for each of our business segments, \nalthough we may add regional offices, depending upon our \nfuture operations.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn addition to the matters described below, in the normal \ncourse of business, the Firm has been named, from time to \ntime, as a defendant in various legal actions, including \narbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in \nconnection with its activities as a global diversified financial \nservices institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal \nactions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or \npunitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of \ndamages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be \nthe primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in \nfinancial distress. These actions include, but are not limited \nto, antitrust claims, claims under various false claims act \nstatutes, and matters arising from our sales and trading \nbusinesses, and our activities in the capital markets.\nThe Firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, \ninvestigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the \nFirm\u2019s business,  and involving, among other matters, sales, \ntrading , financing, prime brokerage, market-making activities, \ninvestment banking advisory services, capital market \nactivities, financial products or offerings sponsored, \nunderwritten or sold by the Firm, wealth and investment \nmanagement services, and accounting and operational \nmatters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, \nsettlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, limitations on our \nability to conduct certain business, or other relief.\nThe Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as \nappropriate in each pending matter.

Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that the Firm, together \nwith a number of other financial institution defendants, \nviolated U.S. and New York state antitrust laws from 2008 \nthrough December of 2016 in connection with their alleged \nefforts to prevent the development of electronic exchange-\nbased platforms for interest rate swaps trading. Complaints \nwere filed both on behalf of a purported class of investors \nwho purchased interest rate swaps f rom defendants, as well as \non behalf of two swap execution facilities that allegedly were \nthwarted by the defendants in their efforts to develop such \nplatforms. The consolidated complaints seek, among other \nrelief, certification of the investor class of plaintiffs and treble \ndamages. On July 28, 2017, the court granted in part and \ndenied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the \ncomplaints. A decision on plaintiffs' motion for class \ncertification is pending.\nIn August of 2017, the Firm was named as a defendant in a \npurported antitrust class action in the United States District \nCourt for the SDNY styled Iowa Public Employees\u2019 \nRetirement System et al. v.

Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that the Firm, together with a \nnumber of other financial institution defendants, violated U.S. \nantitrust laws and New York state law in connection with \ntheir alleged efforts to prevent the development of electronic \nexchange-based platforms for securities lending. The class \naction complaint was filed on behalf of a purported class of \nborrowers and lenders who entered into stock loan \ntransactions with the defendants. The class action complaint \nseeks, among other relief, certification of the class of \nplaintiffs and treble damages. On September 27, 2018, the \ncourt denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the class \naction complaint. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification was \nreferred by the District Court to a magistrate judge who, on \nJune 30, 2022, issued a report and recommendation that the \nDistrict Court certify a class. The motion for class \ncertification and the parties\u2019 objections to the report and \nrecommendation are pending before the District Court.Qui Tam  Matters\nThe Firm and other financial institutions are defending against \nqui tam  litigations brought under various state false claims \nstatutes, including the matter described below. Such matters \nmay involve the same types of claims pursued in multiple \njurisdicti ons and may include claims for treble damages.\nOn August 18, 2009, Relators Roger Hayes and C.
