We were originally incorporated under thelaws of the State of Delaware in 1981, and our predecessorcompanies date back to 1924. We are an FHC regulated bythe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System(\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) under the Bank Holding Company Act of1956, as amended (\u201cBHC Act\u201d). We conduct our businessfrom our headquarters in and around New York City, ourregional offices and branches throughout the U.S. and ourprincipal offices in London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and otherworld financial centers. As of December 31, 2018, we had60,348 employees worldwide.

We define thefollowing as part of our consolidated financial statements(\u201cfinancial statements\u201d): consolidated income statements(\u201cincome statements\u201d), consolidated balance sheets (\u201cbalancesheets\u201d), and consolidated cash flow statements (\u201ccash flowstatements\u201d).

Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, weprovide a wide variety of products and services to a large anddiversified group of clients and customers, including corpora-tions, governments, financial institutions and individuals.Additional information related to our business segments,respective clients, and products and services provided isincluded under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nCompetitionAll aspects of our businesses are highly competitive, and we\nexpect them to remain so. We compete in the U.S. and glob-ally for clients, market share and human talent. Operatingwithin the financial services industry on a global basispresents, among other things, technological, risk manage-\nment, regulatory and other infrastructure challenges thatrequire effective resource allocation in order for us to remaincompetitive. Our competitive position depends on our reputa-tion and the quality and consistency of our long-term invest-ment performance. Our ability to sustain or improve ourcompetitive position also depends substantially on our abilityto continue to attract and retain highly qualified employeeswhile managing compensation and other costs. We competewith commercial banks, brokerage firms, insurance compa-nies, exchanges, electronic trading and clearing platforms,financial data repositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedgefunds and private equity funds, energy companies, financialtechnology firms and other companies offering financial orancillary services in the U.S., globally and digitally orthrough the internet. In addition, restrictive laws and regula-tions applicable to certain U.S. financial services institutions,such as Morgan Stanley, which may prohibit us fromengaging in certain transactions and impose more stringentcapital and liquidity requirements, can put us at a competitivedisadvantage to competitors in certain businesses not subjectto these same requirements. See also \u201cSupervision and Regu-lation\u201d herein and \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nInstitutional Securities and Wealth ManagementOur competitive position for our Institutional Securities and\nWealth Management business segments depends on innova-tion, execution capability and relative pricing. We competedirectly in the U.S. and globally with other securities andfinancial services firms and broker-dealers and with others ona regional or product basis. Additionally, there is increasedcompetition driven by established firms as well as the emer-gence of new firms and business models (including innova-tive uses of technology) competing for the same clients andassets or offering similar products and services.\nOur ability to access capital at competitive rates (which is\ngenerally impacted by our credit ratings), to commit and todeploy capital efficiently, particularly in our capital-intensiveunderwriting and sales, trading, financing and market-makingactivities, also affects our competitive position.

These laws and regulations include: the Dodd-FrankAct; risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity standardsadopted or being developed by the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d), including BaselIII, and the national implementation of those standards;capital planning and stress testing requirements; and newrecovery and resolution regimes in the U.S. and other juris-dictions. Some areas of post-financial crisis regulation arestill subject to final rulemaking or transition periods.\nWe continue to monitor the changing political, tax and regu-\nlatory environment; it is likely that there will be furtherchanges in the way major financial institutions are regulatedin both the U.S. and other markets in which we operate,although it remains difficult to predict the exact impact these\nchanges will have on our business, financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows for a particular future period andwe expect to remain subject to extensive supervision andregulation.\nFinancial Holding CompanyConsolidated Supervision. We have operated as a BHC and\nFHC under the BHC Act since September 2008. As a BHC,we are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision,regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. TheFederal Reserve has heightened authority to examine,prescribe regulations and take action with respect to all of oursubsidiaries. In particular, we are, or will become, subject to(among other things): significantly revised and expandedregulation and supervision; intensive scrutiny of our busi-nesses and plans for expansion of those businesses; limita-tions on activities; a systemic risk regime that imposesheightened capital and liquidity requirements; restrictions onactivities and investments imposed by a section of the BHCAct added by the Dodd-Frank Act referred to as the \u201cVolckerRule\u201d; and comprehensive derivatives regulation. In addition,the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has primary rule-making, enforcement and examination authority over us andour subsidiaries with respect to federal consumer protectionlaws, to the extent applicable.\nScope of Permitted Activities. The BHC Act limits the\nactivities of BHCs and FHCs and grants the Federal Reserveauthority to limit our ability to conduct activities.

In June 2017, the Federal Reserve approved our\napplication for a five-year extension of the transition periodto conform investments in certain legacy covered funds thatare also illiquid funds. The approval covers essentially all ofour non-conforming investments in, and relationships with,legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker Rule. TheVolcker Rule also requires that deductions be made from aBHC\u2019s Tier 1 capital for permissible investments in coveredfunds. In addition, the Volcker Rule requires banking entitiesto have comprehensive compliance programs reasonablydesigned to ensure and monitor compliance with the VolckerRule.\nThe federal financial regulatory agencies responsible for the\nVolcker Rule\u2019s implementing regulations have proposed, buthave not yet finalized, revisions to certain elements of thoseregulations. The proposed changes focus on proprietarytrading and certain requirements imposed in connection withpermitted market making, underwriting and risk-mitigatinghedging activities. The impact of this proposal on us will notbe known with certainty until final rules are issued.\nCapital Standards. The Federal Reserve establishes capital\nrequirements, including well-capitalized standards, for largeBHCs and evaluates our compliance with such requirements.The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and stan-dards for Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. (\u201cMSBNA\u201d) andMorgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association(\u201cMSPBNA\u201d) (collectively, our \u201cU.S. Bank Subsidiaries\u201d).\nRegulatory Capital Framework. The regulatory capitalrequirements for us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries arelargely based on the Basel III capital standards established bythe Basel Committee, as supplemented by certain provisionsof the Dodd-Frank Act. We are subject to various risk-basedcapital requirements with various transition provisions,measured against our Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1capital and Total capital bases, leverage-based capitalrequirements, including the SLR, and additional capitalbuffers above generally applicable minimum standards forBHCs.\nThe Basel Committee has published a comprehensive set of\nrevisions to its Basel III Framework. The revised require-ments are expected to take effect starting January 2022,subject to U.S. banking agencies issuing implementationproposals. The impact on us of any revisions to the BaselCommittee\u2019s capital standards is uncertain and depends onfuture rulemakings by the U.S. banking agencies.\nRegulated Subsidiaries. In addition, many of our regulatedsubsidiaries are, or are expected to be in the future, subject toregulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidi-aries registered as \u201cswap dealers\u201d with the CFTC or\u201csecurity-based swap dealers\u201d with the SEC (collectively,\u201cSwaps Entities\u201d) or registered as broker-dealers or futures\ncommission merchants. Specific regulatory capital require-ments vary by regulated subsidiary, and in many cases thesestandards are not yet established or are subject to ongoingrulemakings that could substantially modify requirements.\nFor more information about the specific capital requirements\napplicable to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, see\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condi-tion and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and CapitalResources\u2014Regulatory Requirements.\u201d\nCapital Planning, Stress Tests and Capital\nDistributions. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FederalReserve has adopted capital planning and stress test require-ments for large BHCs, including Morgan Stanley.

The Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by\nthe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protec-tion Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d), establishes a systemic risk regime towhich certain large BHCs, including Morgan Stanley, aresubject. Under rules issued by the Federal Reserve to implementcertain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s enhanced pruden-tial standards, such large BHCs must conduct internal liquiditystress tests, maintain unencumbered highly liquid assets to meetprojected net cash outflows for 30 days over the range ofliquidity stress scenarios used in internal stress tests, and complywith various liquidity risk management requirements. Theselarge BHCs also must comply with a range of risk managementand corporate governance requirements.\nThe Federal Reserve has adopted a framework to imposesingle-counterparty credit limits (\u201cSCCL\u201d) for large bankingorganizations. U.S. G-SIBs, including us, are subject to alimit of 15% of Tier 1 capital for aggregate net credit expo-sures to any \u201cmajor counterparty\u201d (defined to include otherU.S. G-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs, and nonbank systemicallyimportant financial institutions supervised by the FederalReserve). In addition, we are subject to a limit of 25% of Tier1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any other unaf-filiated counterparty. We must comply with the SCCL frame-work beginning on January 1, 2020.\nThe Federal Reserve has proposed rules that would create a\nnew early remediation framework to address financialdistress or material management weaknesses. The FederalReserve also has the ability to establish additional prudentialstandards, including those regarding contingent capital,enhanced public disclosures and limits on short-term debt,including off-balance sheet exposures.

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank\nAct, we are required to periodically submit to the FederalReserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes ourstrategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bank-ruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress orfailure. Our preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in our2017 resolution plan, is an SPOE strategy. An SPOE strategygenerally contemplates the provision of additional capital andliquidity by the Parent Company to certain of its subsidiaries sothat such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implementthe resolution strategy after the Parent Company has filed forbankruptcy.\nCertain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries are also\nsubject to resolution and recovery planning requirements inthe jurisdictions in which they operate. For example the FDICrequires certain insured depository institutions (\u201cIDIs\u201d),including our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, to submit an annualresolution plan that describes the IDI\u2019s strategy for a rapidand orderly resolution in the event of material financialdistress or failure of the IDI (an \u201cIDI plan\u201d).\nFurther, we are required to submit an annual recovery plan to\nthe Federal Reserve that outlines the steps that managementcould take over time to generate or conserve financialresources in times of prolonged financial stress.\nIn December 2018, the OCC finalized revisions to its\nrecovery planning guidelines for national banks and certainother institutions that increase the threshold at which theguidelines apply from $50 billion to $250 billion in totalconsolidated assets. As a result, our U.S. Bank Subsidiariesare no longer required to prepare recovery plans.\nIn addition, certain financial companies, including BHCs\nsuch as the Firm and certain of its covered subsidiaries, canbe subjected to a resolution proceeding under the orderlyliquidation authority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act withthe FDIC being appointed as receiver, provided that certainprocedures are met, including certain extraordinary financialdistress and systemic risk determinations by the U.S. Trea-sury Secretary in consultation with the U.S. President.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4828, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44b23513-fa17-4fee-8af6-05b07f3954ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "44b23513-fa17-4fee-8af6-05b07f3954ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "883bbcdc-02f7-4622-a14d-6afe6df741e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1e4398406f6f836424e382fc95d435dea33e5797885c3ab3aa64d343843e73df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa9e331e-3948-42dd-adaa-f12ffd035183", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "294a4edd1cc4f7a6f20a6fcda29f863613533f70227b6150bc2404e931bc494c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4f14cbfa-2662-40a2-aa4b-43ae4fde1dcb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "216a6258c67292f3c02dc816837fb67347ba0b58f768b64b9086af090db9f4ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2df2f913ecc81b729d813d0f11fa649a1b40a2b6f5a306a2e1aa263ee1723cd5", "text": "In December 2018, the OCC finalized revisions to its\nrecovery planning guidelines for national banks and certainother institutions that increase the threshold at which theguidelines apply from $50 billion to $250 billion in totalconsolidated assets.

The FDIC has been developing an SPOEstrategy that could be used to implement the orderly liquida-tion authority.\nRegulators have also taken and proposed various actions to\nfacilitate an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,the orderly liquidation authority or other resolution regimes.\nFor example, the Federal Reserve has established rules that\nimpose contractual requirements on certain qualified financialcontracts (\u201ccovered QFCs\u201d) to which U.S. G-SIBs, includingus, and their subsidiaries are parties. The OCC has also estab-lished rules that impose substantively identical requirementson national banks that are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs,including our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as certain otherinstitutions (together with the entities covered by the FederalReserve\u2019s rules, the \u201ccovered entities\u201d). Under these rules,covered QFCs must expressly provide that transfer restric-tions and default rights against covered entities are limited tothe same extent as they would be under the Federal DepositInsurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and theirimplementing regulations. In addition, covered QFCs maynot, among other things, permit the exercise of any cross-default right against covered entities based on an affiliate\u2019sentry into insolvency, resolution or similar proceedings,subject to certain creditor protections. There is a phased-incompliance schedule based on counterparty type, and the firstcompliance date was January 1, 2019.\nFor more information about our resolution plan-related\nsubmissions and associated regulatory actions, see \u201cRiskFactors\u2014Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk\u201d,\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condi-tion and Results of Operations\u2014Regulatory Requirements\u2014Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and CleanHolding Company Requirements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Resultsof Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2014RegulatoryRequirements\u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning.\u201d\nCyber and Information Security Risk ManagementAs a general matter, the financial services industry faces\nincreased global regulatory focus regarding cyber and infor-mation security risk management practices. Many aspects ofour businesses are subject to cybersecurity legal and regula-tory requirements enacted by U.S. federal and state govern-ments and other non-U.S. jurisdictions in the Americas,Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. These laws areaimed at codifying basic cybersecurity protections andmandating data breach notification requirements.Our businesses are also subject to privacy and data protection\ninformation security legal requirements concerning the use andprotection of certain personal information. For example, theGeneral Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) became effectivein the E.U. on May 25, 2018 as a replacement for the E.U. DataProtection Directive. The GDPR imposes mandatory breachnotification obligations, including significant fines for noncom-pliance, enhanced governance and accountability requirementsand has extraterritorial impact. In addition, other jurisdictionshave adopted or are proposing GDPR or similar standards, suchas California, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Colombia, Argentina,India, Turkey, Hong Kong, Brazil, Russia and Switzerland.\nProtection of Client Information\nMany aspects of our businesses are subject to legal require-\nments concerning the use and protection of certain customerinformation. These include those adopted pursuant to theGramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair and Accurate CreditTransactions Act of 2003 in the U.S., the GDPR and variouslaws in Asia, including the Japanese Personal InformationProtection Law, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Protection)Ordinance and the Australian Privacy Act.

MSIP is also regulated and supervised bythe FCA with respect to business conduct matters.\nNon-U.S. policymakers and regulators, including the\nEuropean Commission and European Supervisory Authorities(among others, the European Banking Authority and theEuropean Securities and Markets Authority), continue topropose and adopt numerous reforms, including those thatmay further impact the structure of banks or subject us to newprudential requirements, and to formulate regulatory stan-dards and measures that will be of relevance and importanceto our European operations.\nIn November 2016, the European Commission published a\npackage of proposals including various risk reductionmeasures. These include proposed amendments to the CapitalRequirements Directive and Regulation providing updates torisk-based capital, liquidity, leverage and other prudential stan-dards on a consolidated basis, consistent with final Basel stan-dards. In addition, the proposals would require certain large,non-E.U. financial groups with two or more institutions estab-lished in the E.U. to establish an E.U. IHC. The proposalswould require E.U. banks and broker-dealers to be held belowthe E.U. IHC; until more specific regulations are proposed, itremains unclear which other E.U. entities would need to beheld beneath the E.U. IHC. The E.U. IHC would be subject todirect supervision and authorization by the European CentralBank or the relevant national E.U. regulator. Further amend-ments were also proposed to the E.U. bank recovery and reso-lution regime under the E.U. Bank Recovery and ResolutionDirective (\u201cBRRD\u201d). It is expected that the proposals will beadopted in early 2019, however their final form, as well as thedate of their adoption, is not yet certain.\nThe amendments to the BRRD build on previous proposals\nby regulators in the U.K., E.U. and other major jurisdictionsto finalize recovery and resolution planning frameworks andrelated regulatory requirements that will apply to certain ofour subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions. Forinstance, the BRRD established a recovery and resolutionframework for E.U. credit institutions and investment firms,including MSIP. In addition, certain jurisdictions, includingthe U.K. and other E.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, orare in the process of implementing, changes to resolutionregimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability torecapitalize a failing entity organized in such jurisdictions bywriting down certain unsecured liabilities or converting\ncertain unsecured liabilities into equity.\nRegulators in the U.K., E.U. and other major jurisdictions havealso finalized other regulatory standards applicable to certain ofour subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions. For instance,the European Market Infrastructure Regulation introduced newrequirements regarding the central clearing and reporting ofderivatives, as well as margin requirements for uncleared deriv-atives. MiFID II, which took effect on January 3, 2018, intro-duced comprehensive and new trading and market infrastruc-ture reforms in the E.U., including new trading venues,enhancements to pre- and post-trading transparency, and addi-tional investor protection requirements, among others.

Fluctuations also occur due tothe level of global market activity, which, among otherthings, affects the size, number and timing of investmentbanking client assignments and transactions and the realiza-tion of returns from our principal investments.\nDuring periods of unfavorable market or economic condi-\ntions, the level of individual investor participation in theglobal markets, as well as the level of client assets, may alsodecrease, which would negatively impact the results of ourWealth Management business segment.\nIn addition, fluctuations in global market activity could impact\nthe flow of investment capital into or from AUM and the waycustomers allocate capital among money market, equity, fixedincome or other investment alternatives, which could nega-\ntively impact our Investment Management business segment.\nThe value of our financial instruments may be materially\naffected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquidmarket conditions and disruptions in the credit markets maymake it extremely difficult to value and monetize certain ofour financial instruments, particularly during periods ofmarket displacement. Subsequent valuations in futureperiods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result insignificant changes in the values of these instruments andmay adversely impact historical or prospective fees andperformance-based fees (also known as incentive fees, whichinclude carried interest) in respect of certain businesses. Inaddition, at the time of any sales and settlements of thesefinancial instruments, the price we ultimately realize willdepend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that timeand may be materially lower than their current fair value. Anyof these factors could cause a decline in the value of ourfinancial instruments, which may have an adverse effect onour results of operations in future periods.\nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events\nevidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompaniedby a reduction in asset liquidity. Under these extreme condi-tions, hedging and other risk management strategies may notbe as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would beunder more normal market conditions. Moreover, under theseconditions, market participants are particularly exposed totrading strategies employed by many market participantssimultaneously and on a large scale. Our risk managementand monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate riskto more extreme market moves. However, severe marketevents have historically been difficult to predict and we couldrealize significant losses if extreme market events were tooccur.\nHolding large and concentrated positions may expose us to\nlosses.\nConcentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses\nin our market-making, investing, block trading, underwritingand lending businesses in the event of unfavorable marketmovements, or when market conditions are more favorablefor our competitors. We commit substantial amounts ofcapital to these businesses, which often results in our takinglarge positions in the securities of, or making large loans to, aparticular issuer or issuers in a particular industry, country orregion.

This risk may arise from avariety of business activities, including, but not limited to:extending credit to clients through various lending commit-ments; entering into swap or other derivative contracts underwhich counterparties have obligations to make payments tous; providing short- or long-term funding that is secured byphysical or financial collateral whose value may at times beinsufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount; postingmargin and/or collateral and other commitments to clearinghouses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firmsand other financial counterparties; and investing and tradingin securities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assetsmay fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on theunderlying obligations or loans.\nWe also incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business\nsegment lending to mainly individual investors, including,but not limited to, margin- and securities-based loans collat-eralized by securities, residential mortgage loans andHELOCs.\nWhile we believe current valuations and reserves adequately\naddress our perceived levels of risk, adverse economic condi-tions may negatively impact our clients and our credit expo-sures. In addition, as a clearing member of several centralcounterparties, we finance our customer positions and couldbe held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of ourcustomers. Although we regularly review our credit expo-sures, default risk may arise from events or circumstancesthat are difficult to detect or foresee.\nA default by a large financial institution could adversely\naffect financial markets.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions\nmay be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading,clearing or other relationships among the institutions.Increased centralization of trading activities through partic-ular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges as requiredby provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may increase ourconcentration of risk with respect to these entities. As aresult, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by,one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidityand credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions.This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d and may\nadversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearinghouses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks and securitiesfirms, with which we interact on a daily basis and, therefore,could adversely affect us.

Factors that we cannotcontrol, such as disruption of the financial markets or nega-tive views about the financial services industry generally,including concerns regarding fiscal matters in the U.S. andother geographic areas, could impair our ability to raisefunding.\nIn addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if\ninvestors or lenders develop a negative perception of ourlong-term or short-term financial prospects due to factorssuch as an incurrence of large trading losses, a downgrade bythe rating agencies, a decline in the level of our businessactivity, if regulatory authorities take significant actionagainst us or our industry, or we discover significantemployee misconduct or illegal activity.\nIf we are unable to raise funding using the methods described\nabove, we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencum-bered assets, such as our investment portfolios or tradingassets, to meet maturing liabilities.

Ongoing implementation of, or changes in,laws and regulations could materially impact the profitabilityof our businesses and the value of assets we hold, expose usto additional costs, require changes to business practices orforce us to discontinue businesses, adversely affect our abilityto pay dividends and repurchase our stock or require us toraise capital, including in ways that may adversely impact ourshareholders or creditors.\nIn addition, regulatory requirements that are being imposed\nby foreign policymakers and regulators may be inconsistentor conflict with regulations that we are subject to in the U.S.and may adversely affect us. We expect legal and regulatoryrequirements to be subject to ongoing change for the foresee-able future, which may result in significant new costs tocomply with new or revised requirements as well as tomonitor for compliance on an ongoing basis.\nThe application of regulatory requirements and strategies in\nthe U.S. or other jurisdictions to facilitate the orderlyresolution of large financial institutions may pose a greaterrisk of loss for our security holders, and subject us to otherrestrictions.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to periodi-\ncally submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolutionplan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolu-tion under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of materialfinancial distress or failure. If the Federal Reserve and theFDIC were to jointly determine that our resolution plansubmission was not credible or would not facilitate an orderlyresolution, and if we were unable to address any deficienciesidentified by the regulators, we or any of our subsidiaries maybe subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidityrequirements or restrictions on our growth, activities, or oper-ations, or after a two-year period, we may be required todivest assets or operations.\nIn addition, provided that certain procedures are met, we can\nbe subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liqui-dation authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act with theFDIC being appointed as receiver. The FDIC\u2019s power underthe orderly liquidation authority to disregard the priority ofcreditor claims and treat similarly situated creditors differ-ently in certain circumstances, subject to certain limitations,could adversely impact holders of our unsecured debt.

An SPOE strategy generally contem-plates the provision of additional capital and liquidity by theParent Company to certain of its subsidiaries so that suchsubsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement theresolution strategy, and the Parent Company has entered intoa secured amended and restated support agreement with itsmaterial entities, as defined in our 2017 resolution plan,pursuant to which it would provide such capital and liquidity.\nUnder the secured amended and restated support agreement,\nupon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, including one inwhich an SPOE strategy is used, the Parent Company will beobligated to contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all ofits contributable material assets, other than shares in subsidi-aries of the Parent Company and certain intercompanypayables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, toour material entities. The obligations of the Parent Companyunder the secured amended and restated support agreementare in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of theParent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of theParent Company). As a result, claims of our material entitiesagainst the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares insubsidiaries of the Parent Company) are effectively senior tounsecured obligations of the Parent Company.

Forexample, the Federal Reserve requires top-tier BHCs of U.S.G-SIBs, including Morgan Stanley, to maintain minimumamounts of equity and eligible long-term debt TLAC in orderto ensure that such institutions have enough loss-absorbingresources at the point of failure to be recapitalized throughthe conversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposinglosses on eligible TLAC where the SPOE strategy is used.The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategyand the TLAC requirement is that our losses will be imposedon the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms ofeligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before anylosses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of ouroperating subsidiaries or before putting U.S. taxpayers at risk.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and other\nE.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, or are in the process ofimplementing, changes to resolution regimes to provide reso-lution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failingentity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certainunsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabil-ities into equity. Such \u201cbail-in\u201d powers are intended to enablethe recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating lossesto its shareholders and unsecured creditors.

Investigations and proceedings initiated bythese authorities may result in adverse judgments, settle-ments, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.

The modified territorial taxsystem includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatri-ated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and also imposes aminimum tax on GILTI and an alternative BEAT on U.S.corporations with operations outside of the U.S. See also\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condi-tion and Results of Operations\u2014Supplemental FinancialInformation and Disclosures\u2014Income Tax Matters.\u201d\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed regula-\ntions on certain provisions in the Tax Act, some of which arenot yet finalized and are therefore subject to change. In addi-tion, there continue to be a number of uncertainties and ambi-guities as to the interpretation and application of many of theprovisions in the Tax Act, including the provisions relating tothe modified territorial tax system, GILTI, and the BEAT. Inthe absence of further guidance on these issues, we use whatwe believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions inapplying the Tax Act for purposes of determining our taxbalances and results of operations, which may change as wereceive additional clarification and implementation guidanceand as the interpretation of the Tax Act evolves over time.We expect that the U.S. Treasury Department will continue toissue additional guidance on the application of various provi-sions in the Tax Act. It is possible that such additional guid-ance or positions taken by the IRS in an audit could differfrom the interpretations and assumptions that we previouslymade, which could have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations and financial condition.Risk Management\nOur risk management strategies, models and processes may\nnot be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in allmarket environments or against all types of risk.\nWe have devoted significant resources to develop our risk\nmanagement capabilities and expect to continue to do so inthe future. Nonetheless, our risk management strategies,models and processes, including our use of various riskmodels for assessing market exposures and hedging strat-egies, stress testing and other analysis, may not be fully effec-tive in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environ-ments or against all types of risk, including risks that areunidentified or unanticipated.\nAs our businesses change and grow, and the markets in which\nwe operate evolve, our risk management strategies, modelsand processes may not always adapt with those changes.Some of our methods of managing risk are based upon ouruse of observed historical market behavior and management\u2019sjudgment. As a result, these methods may not predict futurerisk exposures, which could be significantly greater than thehistorical measures indicate.\nIn addition, many models we use are based on assumptions or\ninputs regarding correlations among prices of various assetclasses or other market indicators and therefore cannot antici-pate sudden, unanticipated or unidentified market oreconomic movements, which could cause us to incur losses.\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity, operational, model,\nlegal, regulatory and compliance risks requires, among otherthings, policies and procedures to record properly and verifya large number of transactions and events, and these policiesand procedures may not be fully effective. Our trading riskmanagement strategies and techniques also seek to balanceour ability to profit from trading positions with our exposureto potential losses.\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of risk moni-\ntoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques andthe judgments that accompany their application cannot antici-pate every economic and financial outcome or the timing ofsuch outcomes. For example, to the extent that our trading orinvesting activities involve less liquid trading markets or areotherwise subject to restrictions on sales or hedging, we maynot be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce ourrisk associated with such positions. We may, therefore, incurlosses in the course of our trading or investing activities.

It is expected that a transition awayfrom the widespread use of such rates to alternative rates basedon observable market transactions and other potential interestrate benchmark reforms will occur over the course of the nextfew years. For example, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, hasannounced that it has commitments from panel banks tocontinue to contribute to LIBOR through the end of 2021, butthat it will not use its powers to compel contributions beyondsuch date. Accordingly, there is considerable uncertaintyregarding the publication of LIBOR beyond 2021.\nOn April 3, 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\ncommenced publication of three reference rates based on over-night U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement transactions,including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, which has beenrecommended as an alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR by theAlternative Reference Rates Committee. Further, the Bank ofEngland is publishing a reformed Sterling Overnight IndexAverage, comprised of a broader set of overnight Sterling moneymarket transactions, which has been selected by the WorkingGroup on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates as the alternativerate to Sterling LIBOR. Central bank-sponsored committees inother jurisdictions, including Europe, Japan and Switzerland,have, or are expected to, select alternative reference ratesdenominated in other currencies.\nThe market transition away from IBORs to alternative refer-\nence rates is complex and could have a range of adverseimpacts on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. In particular, any such transition or reform could:\n\u0081 Adversely impact the pricing, liquidity, value of, return on\nand trading for a broad array of financial products,including any IBOR-linked securities, loans and derivativesthat are included in our financial assets and liabilities;\n\u0081 Require extensive changes to documentation that governs\nor references IBOR or IBOR-based products, including, forexample, pursuant to time-consuming renegotiations ofexisting documentation to modify the terms of outstandingsecurities and related hedging transactions;\n\u0081 Result in inquiries or other actions from regulators in\nrespect of our preparation and readiness for the replace-ment of IBOR with one or more alternative reference rates;\u0081 Result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counter-\nparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability ofprovisions in IBOR-based products such as fallbacklanguage or other related provisions, including in the caseof fallbacks to the alternative reference rates, anyeconomic, legal, operational or other impact resulting fromthe fundamental differences between the IBORs and thevarious alternative reference rates;\n\u0081 Require the transition and/or development of appropriate\nsystems and analytics to effectively transition our riskmanagement processes from IBOR-based products to thosebased on one or more alternative reference rates in a timelymanner, including by quantifying value and risk for variousalternative reference rates, which may prove challenging giventhe limited history of the proposed alternative reference rates;and\n\u0081 Cause us to incur additional costs in relation to any of the\nabove factors.\nDepending on several factors including those set forth above, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could bematerially adversely impacted by the market transition or reformof certain benchmarks. Other factors include the pace of thetransition to replacement or reformed rates, the specific termsand parameters for and market acceptance of any alternativereference rate, prices of and the liquidity of trading markets forproducts based on alternative reference rates, and our ability totransition and develop appropriate systems and analytics for oneor more alternative reference rates.\nCompetitive EnvironmentWe face strong competition from other financial services\nfirms, which could lead to pricing pressures that couldmaterially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nThe financial services industry and all aspects of our businesses\nare intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so.

Member States), during which the U.K. governmentnegotiated a form of withdrawal agreement with the E.U.Absent any changes to this time schedule, the U.K. isexpected to leave the E.U. by March 29, 2019. The proposedwithdrawal agreement includes a transition period untilDecember 2020 and provides that the U.K. will leave theE.U. single market and will seek a phased period of imple-mentation for a new U.K.-E.U. relationship that may coverthe legal and regulatory framework applicable to financialinstitutions with significant operations in Europe, such as theFirm.\nThe withdrawal agreement was rejected by the U.K. Parlia-\nment on January 15, 2019, and the U.K. Government is in theprocess of negotiating changes to the withdrawal agreementthat would be acceptable to the U.K. Parliament and the E.U.As a result, the terms and conditions of the anticipated with-drawal from the E.U. remain uncertain.\nThe ongoing political uncertainty in relation to the proposed\nwithdrawal agreement in the U.K. means there is a risk thatthese arrangements may not be ready for implementation byMarch 29, 2019 or that there will be no transition period.Potential effects of the U.K. exit from the E.U. and potentialmitigation actions may vary considerably depending on thetiming of withdrawal, the nature of any transition, implemen-tation or successor arrangements, and the future tradingarrangements between the U.K. and the E.U.\nIf the withdrawal agreement (or any alternative agreement) is\nnot agreed and as a result no transition period applies, ourU.K. licensed entities may be unable to rely on E.U. pass-porting rights to provide services in a number of E.U. juris-dictions beginning March 29, 2019, absent further regulatoryrelief. Even if a transition period is agreed, our U.K. licensedentities may lose their rights to provide services in a numberof E.U. jurisdictions after such transition period unless thenew U.K.-E.U. relationship provides for such rights.In order to prepare for this risk, we are taking steps to make\nchanges to our European operations in an effort to ensure thatwe can continue to provide cross-border banking and invest-ment and other services in E.U. Member States without theneed for separate regulatory authorizations in each memberstate.

Inmany markets, the realized and unrealized gains and lossesfrom the purchase and sale transactions will include any\nspreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loanscarried at fair value and dividends from equity securities arealso recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positionscarried at fair value.\nAs a market maker, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise\ntransact with customers under a variety of market conditionsand to provide firm or indicative prices in response tocustomer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit insome cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willingto transact with them.

These fees are generally recognized annually.\nCompensation ExpenseCompensation and benefits expense includes accruals for\nbase salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs,discretionary incentive compensation, amortization ofdeferred cash and equity awards, changes in the fair value ofinvestments to which certain deferred compensation plans arereferenced, carried interest, severance costs, and other itemssuch as health and welfare benefits.\nThe factors that drive compensation for our employees vary\nfrom quarter to quarter, from segment to segment and withina segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in theWealth Management and Investment Management businesssegments, compensation is largely paid on the basis of formu-laic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues.Compensation for most other employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities businesssegment, may also include incentive compensation that isdetermined following the assessment of the Firm\u2019s, businessunit\u2019s and individual\u2019s performance. Compensation for ourremaining employees is largely fixed in nature ( i.e., base\nsalary and benefits).\n33 December 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5097, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8357c728-654c-4526-af53-5a03e2177372": {"__data__": {"id_": "8357c728-654c-4526-af53-5a03e2177372", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0c3a5e74-a27a-453a-842b-6d852b953418", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d654489ca03a16a79340c36690b46f0bf5383b9971d9d968083d7968bed4971b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea20dc61-1e93-4f0d-94c9-02f1e2de895b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "bdcddca682d0e82efe942ab0e4aeecc8d849e6254075cc6a5419bd96fc46e3ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7e9c98f3-4249-4581-9c0c-07e7b6d3eb94", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "292f03d0994f07a279dbfe4396aac283b33f0962eed574f6bfd46e8a04d51008", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "29ad6bce34019ddb1625c87b7c2ba29928efa316ff52dfd2d701e6208862be60", "text": "Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nCompensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation\nplans is calculated based on the notional value of the awardgranted, adjusted for upward and downward changes in fairvalue of the referenced investment, and is recognized ratablyover the prescribed vesting period for the award.

The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, signifi-\ncantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by reducing thecorporate income tax rate to 21%, partially or wholly elimi-nating tax deductions for certain expenses and implementing amodified territorial tax system.

Accounting updates notlisted below were assessed and determined to be either notapplicable or are not expected to have a significant impact onour financial statements.\nThe following accounting updates were adopted on January 1,\n2019:\n\u0081Derivatives and Hedging (ASU 2018-16) . The amendments\nin this update permit use of the OIS rate based on theSecured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S. benchmarkinterest rate for hedge accounting purposes. We adoptedthis update on a prospective basis for qualifying new orredesignated hedging relationships; this update does notimpact our existing hedges.\u0081Leases. This accounting update requires lessees to recog-\nnize all leases with terms exceeding one year in the balancesheet, which results in the recognition of a right of use assetand corresponding lease liability, including for those leasesthat we currently classify as operating leases. Theaccounting for leases where we are the lessor is largelyunchanged.\nThe right of use asset and lease liability were initially\nmeasured using the present value of the remaining rentalpayments. We adopted this accounting update through acumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.\nAt transition on January 1, 2019, the adoption of this stan-\ndard resulted in a balance sheet gross-up of approximately$4 billion reflected in Other assets and Other liabilities andaccrued expenses. In addition, previously deferred gainsfrom sale-leaseback transactions of approximately$60 million were recognized directly into retained earnings.Prior period amounts were not restated.\nThe following accounting update is currently being evaluated\nto determine the potential impact of adoption:\n\u0081Financial Instruments\u2013Credit Losses. This accounting\nupdate impacts the impairment model for certain financialassets measured at amortized cost by requiring a CECLmethodology to estimate expected credit losses over theentire life of the financial asset, recorded at inception orpurchase. CECL will replace the loss model currentlyapplicable to loans held for investment, HTM securitiesand other receivables carried at amortized cost, such asemployee loans.\nThe update also eliminates the concept of other-than-\ntemporary impairment for AFS securities. Impairments onAFS securities will be required to be recognized in earn-ings through an allowance when the fair value is less thanamortized cost and a credit loss exists or the securities areexpected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost.\nUnder the update, there may be an ability to determine\nthere are no expected credit losses in certain circumstances,e.g., based on collateral arrangements for lending and\nfinancing transactions or based on the credit quality of theborrower or issuer.\nBased on preliminary estimates, we expect the impact from\nthe adoption of this standard will primarily result from theemployee loans, wholesale real estate, corporate and resi-dential real estate portfolios.

We believe that ofour significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the finan-cial statements), the following policies involve a higherdegree of judgment and complexity.\nFair ValueFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair ValueA significant number of our financial instruments are carried\nat fair value. We make estimates regarding the valuation ofassets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing thefinancial statements. These assets and liabilities include, butare not limited to:\n\u0081 Trading assets and Trading liabilities;\u0081 Investment Securities\u2014AFS securities;\u0081 Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;\u0081 Certain Deposits, primarily structured certificates of\ndeposits;\n\u0081 Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;\u0081 Certain Other secured financings; and\u0081 Certain Borrowings, primarily structured notes.Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ( i.e., the exit price)\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at themeasurement date.\nIn determining fair value, we use various valuation\napproaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fairvalue that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputsand minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs byrequiring that the relevant observable inputs be used whenavailable. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels,wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets,Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices inmarkets that are not active or for which all significant inputsare observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniquesthat incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, there-fore, require the greatest use of judgment.In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices\nand inputs may be reduced for many instruments, whichcould cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 toLevel 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn inmarket conditions could lead to declines in the valuation ofmany instruments. For further information on the definitionof fair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuationtechniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivityof significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair valuemeasurements, see Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements.\nWhere appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to\naccount for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-askadjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentra-tion risk in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discus-sion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to thefinancial statements.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a\nNon-recurring Basis\nCertain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value\non a non-recurring basis, primarily relating to loans, otherinvestments, premises, equipment and software costs, intan-gible assets, other assets, and other liabilities and accruedexpenses. We incur losses or gains for any adjustments ofthese assets to fair value. A downturn in market conditionscould result in impairment charges in future periods.\nFor assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nnon-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using variousvaluation approaches. The same hierarchy as describedabove, which maximizes the use of observable inputs andminimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generallyrequiring that the observable inputs be used when available,is used in measuring fair value for these items.\nSee Note 3 to the financial statements for further information\non assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on anon-recurring basis.\nGoodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwillEvaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to\nmake significant judgments. Goodwill impairment tests areperformed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at thelevel of or one level below our business segments. Goodwillno longer retains its association with a particular acquisitiononce it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all theactivities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organicallydeveloped, are available to support the value of the goodwill.\n47 December 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4461, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3128e3ac-ebe5-4a7f-bbd6-2451bde7c5f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3128e3ac-ebe5-4a7f-bbd6-2451bde7c5f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30cf0b4d-1de9-4e8e-a701-03f265061352", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "82016f04cd15d829cd98496c9d1ee157b0e009081341a3e2f73f8e547f890919", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9ee65d6-30c9-4624-9697-4fff5aea4163", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "cee61116b5d1b4aed66957a8bc2b010fc5007349c0e0641149138a08cd9c7b62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5153a6cd-79bc-4905-a9bc-2f3ab52863d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffec64363f9094077097aa83e99ed624c63507403747bcfaa3824c4cd786a1a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5a304c006b4e6f2d5957afa46fd35df0304e9aa73de308c05b281acd9a6e4c01", "text": "Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of\nJuly 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circum-stances exist.\nFor both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to\neither (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) firstperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it ismore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit isless than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitativetest would be performed.\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare\nthe fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount,including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit isless than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss isequal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value,limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to thatreporting unit.\nThe estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived\nbased on valuation techniques we believe market participantswould use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fairvalue is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cashflow methodology or methodologies that incorporateprice-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certaincomparable companies. At each annual goodwill impairmenttesting date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had afair value that was substantially in excess of its carryingvalue.\nIntangible AssetsAmortizable intangible assets are amortized over their esti-\nmated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment on aninterim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. Animpairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangibleasset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recog-nized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is notrecoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amountof the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sumof the expected undiscounted cash flows.\nFor both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the newcost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairmentlosses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, thenew cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life ofthat asset. Adverse market or economic events could result inimpairment charges in future periods.\nSee Notes 2, 3 and 9 to the financial statements for additional\ninformation about goodwill and intangible assets.Legal and Regulatory Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we have been named, from\ntime to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, includingarbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising inconnection with our activities as a global diversified financialservices institution.\nCertain of the actual or threatened legal actions include\nclaims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damagesor claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In somecases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defen-dants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.\nWe are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews,\ninvestigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) bygovernmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding ourbusiness and involving, among other matters, sales andtrading activities, wealth and investment managementservices, financial products or offerings sponsored, under-written or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters,certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settle-ments, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.\nAccruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are gener-\nally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where availableinformation indicates that it is probable a liability had beenincurred at the date of the financial statements and we canreasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue theestimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings,however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether anyloss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount ofany loss.\nFor certain legal proceedings and investigations, we can esti-\nmate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss orranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued. Forcertain other legal proceedings and investigations, we cannotreasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedingsand investigations where the factual record is being devel-oped or contested or where plaintiffs or government entitiesseek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution,disgorgement or penalties.\nNumerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or\nadditional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss canbe reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation,including through potentially lengthy discovery and determi-nation of important factual matters, determination of issuesrelated to class certification and the calculation of damages orother relief, and addressing novel or unsettled legal questionsrelevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.\nDecember 2018 Form 10-K 48", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5073, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5153a6cd-79bc-4905-a9bc-2f3ab52863d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "5153a6cd-79bc-4905-a9bc-2f3ab52863d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9673549e-4958-498c-885c-dc798b5c9e11", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "01dc2707d0ea03f5b52f56c195efbc23c0bcbe2822a5a34073f378ba018eaed4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3128e3ac-ebe5-4a7f-bbd6-2451bde7c5f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5a304c006b4e6f2d5957afa46fd35df0304e9aa73de308c05b281acd9a6e4c01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6b9b2bf-9601-4fc5-a05f-6788fbe80907", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d28e889029b408d75199644a22c9f2daa598d98f7eb45f336497792b6d658df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ffec64363f9094077097aa83e99ed624c63507403747bcfaa3824c4cd786a1a6", "text": "Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nSignificant judgment is required in deciding when and if to\nmake these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim orregulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially differentfrom the recorded accruals.\nSee Note 12 to the financial statements for additional infor-\nmation on legal proceedings.\nIncome TaxesWe are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the\nU.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreignjurisdictions in which we have significant business opera-tions. These tax laws are complex and subject to differentinterpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmentaltaxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpreta-tions about the application of these inherently complex taxlaws when determining the provision for income taxes andthe expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimatesabout when certain items affect taxable income in the varioustax jurisdictions.\nDisputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled\nwith the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We peri-odically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxingjurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years\u2019examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to poten-tial losses that may arise from tax audits are established inaccordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Onceestablished, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted whenthere is more information available or when an event occursrequiring a change.\nOur provision for income taxes is composed of current and\ndeferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to bepaid or refunded for the current period. Deferred incometaxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differencesbetween the financial reporting and tax bases of assets andliabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted taxrates and laws that will be in effect when such differences areexpected to reverse.\nOur deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets\nrelated to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operatinglosses and tax credits that will be realized through reductionof future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expi-ration if not utilized within certain periods. We performregular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets arerealizable. These reviews include management\u2019s estimatesand assumptions regarding future taxable income and incor-porate various tax planning strategies, including strategiesthat may be available to tax attribute carryforwards beforethey expire.Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined,\nwe may record a valuation allowance against the deferred taxasset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is morelikely than not to be realized at a future date. Both current anddeferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to ourunrecognized tax benefits.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the consoli-\ndated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current anddeferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any),accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions.Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assess-ment may ultimately be materially different from therecorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for additional informa-\ntion on our significant assumptions, judgments and interpreta-tions associated with the accounting for income taxes andNote 20 to the financial statements for additional informationon our tax examinations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSenior management, with oversight by the Asset/LiabilityManagement Committee and the Board of Directors(\u201cBoard\u201d), establishes and maintains our liquidity and capitalpolicies. Through various risk and control committees, seniormanagement reviews business performance relative to thesepolicies, monitors the availability of alternative sources offinancing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate andcurrency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. TheTreasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/LiabilityManagement Committee, and other committees and controlgroups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling theimpact that our business activities have on our balance sheet,liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital mattersare reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committeeof the Board.\nBalance Sheet\nWe monitor and evaluate the composition and size of ourbalance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet manage-ment process includes quarterly planning, business-specificthresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus keyperformance metrics and new business impact assessments.\nWe establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and\nbusiness segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilizationand review variances resulting from business activity andmarket fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review currentperformance versus established thresholds and assess theneed to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business unitneeds. We also monitor key metrics, including asset andliability size and capital usage.\n49 December 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5195, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6b9b2bf-9601-4fc5-a05f-6788fbe80907": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6b9b2bf-9601-4fc5-a05f-6788fbe80907", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c61e8192-5d17-4de4-9b17-c9d00cb0527e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6c3b3b7c131d1005189438d01df774517ce90e20d2d1648aa6cc2e8df4115d6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5153a6cd-79bc-4905-a9bc-2f3ab52863d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ffec64363f9094077097aa83e99ed624c63507403747bcfaa3824c4cd786a1a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1635295d-76fb-487f-ae43-27c8174142a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63b31f42026e2ca064bac3a2c14bc7e834f261ba6323a989ea09f133853ac3a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5d28e889029b408d75199644a22c9f2daa598d98f7eb45f336497792b6d658df", "text": "Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nTotal Assets by Business Segment\nAt December 31, 2018\n$ in millions IS WM IM Total\nAssetsCash and cash equivalents\n1 $ 69,526 $ 17,621 $ 49 $ 87,196\nTrading assets at fair value 263,870 60 2,369 266,299\nInvestment securities 23,273 68,559 \u2014 91,832\nSecurities purchased under\nagreements to resell 80,660 17,862 \u2014 98,522\nSecurities borrowed 116,207 106 \u2014 116,313\nCustomer and other\nreceivables 35,777 16,865 656 53,298\nLoans, net of allowance2 43,380 72,194 5 115,579\nOther assets3 13,734 9,125 1,633 24,492\nTotal assets $ 646,427 $ 202,392 $ 4,712 $ 853,531\nAt December 31, 2017\n$ in millions IS WM IM Total\nAssetsCash and cash equivalents\n1 $ 63,597 $ 16,733 $ 65 $ 80,395\nTrading assets at fair value 295,678 59 2,545 298,282Investment securities 19,556 59,246 \u2014 78,802Securities purchased under\nagreements to resell 74,732 9,526 \u2014 84,258\nSecurities borrowed 123,776 234 \u2014 124,010Customer and other\nreceivables 36,803 18,763 621 56,187\nLoans, net of allowance\n2 36,269 67,852 5 104,126\nOther assets3 14,563 9,596 1,514 25,673\nTotal assets $ 664,974 $ 182,009 $ 4,750 $ 851,733\nIS\u2014Institutional Securities\nWM\u2014Wealth ManagementIM\u2014Investment Management1.

Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sover-\neign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds.\nThe increase in the LCR in the quarter ended December 31,\n2018 is due to increased HQLA consistent with higherliquidity levels, and a reduction in net outflows ( i.e., the\ndenominator of the ratio), primarily driven by lower securedfunding and lending commitment outflows.\nThe Firm\u2019s calculations are based on our current under-\nstanding of the LCR and other factors, which may be subjectto change as we receive additional clarification and imple-mentation guidance from regulators and as the interpretationof the LCR evolves over time.\nNet Stable Funding RatioThe objective of the NSFR is to reduce funding risk over a\none-year horizon by requiring banking organizations to fundtheir activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding inorder to mitigate the risk of future funding stress.\nThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel\nCommittee\u201d) has previously finalized the NSFR framework.In May 2016, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposal toimplement the NSFR in the U.S. The proposal would requirea covered company to maintain an amount of available stablefunding, which is measured with reference to sources offunding, including deposit and debt liabilities, that is no lessthan the amount of its required stable funding, which ismeasured by applying standardized weightings to its assets,derivatives exposures and certain other items.\nIf adopted as proposed, the requirements would apply to us\nand our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. We continue to evaluate thepotential impact of the proposal, which is subject to further\nrulemaking procedures. Our preliminary estimates, based onthe current proposal, indicate that actions will be necessary tomeet the requirement, which we would expect to accomplishby the effective date of any final rule. Our preliminary esti-mates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may causeactual results based on the final rule to differ materially fromestimates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that mayaffect our future results, see \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nFunding ManagementWe manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of\ndisruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversi-fication of secured and unsecured funding sources (byproduct, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that thetenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holdingperiod of the assets being financed.\nWe fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse\nsources. These sources include our equity capital, borrow-ings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securi-ties lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. Wehave active financing programs for both standard and struc-tured products targeting global investors and currencies.\nSecured FinancingThe liquid nature of the marketable securities and short-term\nreceivables arising principally from sales and trading activ-ities in the Institutional Securities business segment providesus with flexibility in managing the composition and size ofour balance sheet. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix ofdurable secured and unsecured financing. Secured financinginvestors principally focus on the quality of the eligiblecollateral posted.

As acomponent of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework,we hold a portion of our GLR against the potential disruptionto our secured financing capabilities.\nDecember 2018 Form 10-K 52", "start_char_idx": 3514, "end_char_idx": 5204, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf38a0ef-c19a-4bf6-bff5-ab5115bc8c04": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf38a0ef-c19a-4bf6-bff5-ab5115bc8c04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6cc81dd4-086f-4e3d-bab6-38f5e8b4d861", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6341017c98be568ee8ce7ec6635075cb69471b0990e17f130d922fded67c725f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5206e863-0544-4c06-9b48-8e3b57caec3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3162d18c518099661d0344e1c4d95f5f26daf07f43ea7dad6e2c1cd9e28e0280", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b3ff8b34-181d-4222-a1f5-d14e0c8c954d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8118537f5f65d3ecea63317a51eb9c83dea5be0ce9b47614784f2a24d9ab9184", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b67b01c9324732569b82a7ab2454e19f283c22e4701831d9974269f18c22f274", "text": "Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nWe generally maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable\nsecurities, which takes into account HQLA classificationsconsistent with LCR definitions, and other regulatory require-ments, and provides a valuable future source of liquidity.\nCollateralized Financing Transactions\n$ in millionsAt\nDecember 31,\n2018At\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSecurities purchased under agreements\nto resell and Securities borrowed $ 214,835 $ 208,268\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase and Securities loaned $ 61,667 $ 70,016\nSecurities received as collateral1 $ 7,668 $ 13,749\nAverage Daily Balance\nThree Months Ended\n$ in millionsDecember 31,\n2018December 31,\n2017\nSecurities purchased under agreements\nto resell and Securities borrowed $ 213,974 $ 214,343\nSecurities sold under agreements\nto repurchase and Securities loaned $ 57,677 $ 66,879\n1.

In addition, the issuance of borrowingswith original maturities greater than one year allows us toreduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments.Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year aregenerally managed to achieve staggered maturities, therebymitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversi-fication through sales to global institutional and retail clientsacross regions, currencies and product types.\nThe availability and cost of financing to us can vary\ndepending on market conditions, the volume of certaintrading and lending activities, our credit ratings and theoverall availability of credit. We also engage in, and maycontinue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings in theordinary course of business.\nFor further information on Borrowings, see Note 11 to the\nfinancial statements.\nCredit RatingsWe rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of\nour daily operations. The cost and availability of financinggenerally are impacted by our credit ratings, among otherthings. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact oncertain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses wherelonger-term counterparty performance is a key consideration,such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit deriva-tives and interest rate swaps. When determining credit ratings,rating agencies consider company-specific factors, otherindustry factors such as regulatory or legislative changes andthe macroeconomic environment, among other things.\nOur credit ratings do not include any uplift from perceived\ngovernment support from any rating agency given the signifi-cant progress of U.S. financial reform legislation and regula-tions.

Minimum risk-based capital\nratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital,Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2capital). Certain adjustments to and deductions from capitalare required for purposes of determining these ratios, such asgoodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, otheramounts in AOCI and investments in the capital instrumentsof unconsolidated financial institutions.\nIn addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio require-\nments, we are subject to the following buffers in 2019:\n\u0081 A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conser-\nvation buffer;\n\u0081 The Common Equity Tier 1 G-SIB capital surcharge,\ncurrently at 3%; and\n\u0081 Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 CCyB, currently set\nby U.S. banking agencies at zero.\nIn 2018 and 2017, each of the buffers was 75% and 50%,\nrespectively, of the fully phased-in 2019 requirement notedabove. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restric-tions on our ability to make capital distributions, includingthe payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and topay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. For a furtherdiscussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see \u201cG-SIB CapitalSurcharge\u201d herein.\nRisk-Weighted Assets. RWA reflects both our on- and\noff-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributableto the risk of loss arising from the following:\n\u0081 Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or\nissuer to meet its financial obligations to us;\n\u0081 Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more\nmarket prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations orother market factors, such as market liquidity; and\n\u0081 Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems,\nfrom human factors or from external events ( e.g., fraud,\ntheft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damageto physical assets).For a further discussion of our credit, market and operational\nrisks, see \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures aboutRisk.\u201d\nOur risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining\nregulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratioscomputed under (i) the standardized approaches for calcu-lating credit risk and market risk RWA (\u201cStandardizedApproach\u201d) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches forcalculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWA(\u201cAdvanced Approach\u201d). The credit risk RWA calculationsbetween the two approaches differ in that the StandardizedApproach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed riskweights, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models tocalculate exposure amounts and risk weights. AtDecember 31, 2018, our ratios for determining regulatorycompliance are based on the Standardized Approach rules,while at December 31, 2017, the ratios were based on theStandardized Approach transitional rules.\nEffective January 1, 2019, Common Equity Tier 1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital requirements, inclusive ofbuffers, increase to 10.0%, 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively.\nSee \u201cTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and\nClean Holding Company Requirements\u201d herein for additionalcapital requirements effective January 1, 2019.\nLeverage-Based Regulatory Capital .

Amount reflects assets not in a defined category, non-material portfolios of expo-\nsures and unsettled transactions, as applicable.\nCredit risk RWA increased in 2018 under the Standardized\nand Advanced Approaches primarily due to increased corpo-rate lending exposures within the Institutional Securities busi-ness segment. Under the Standardized Approach, thisincrease was partially offset by a reduction in RWA for Secu-rities financing transactions due to a decline in the marketvalue of associated securities. Under the Advanced Approach,Credit risk RWA also increased in 2018 for Investment secu-rities driven by model revisions that increased the riskweighting for certain counterparty types.\nMarket risk RWA decreased in 2018 under the Standardized\nand Advanced Approaches primarily due to a decrease innon-securitization-specific risk charges mainly as a result ofreduced exposures in equity derivatives and bonds. In addi-tion, securitization-specific risk charges decreased primarilydue to reduced exposures in mortgage-backed securities and\ncollateralized loan obligations.\nThe decrease in operational risk RWA under the Advanced\nApproach in 2018 reflects a continued reduction in thefrequency and magnitude of internal losses utilized in theoperational risk capital model related to litigation and execu-tion and processing, partially offset by an increase associatedwith a risk scenario update.\nG-SIB Capital SurchargeWe and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to a risk-based capital\nsurcharge.

In addition, covered BHCs mustmeet a separate external LTD requirement equal to the greaterof (i) total RWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the higherof the Method 1 and Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge appli-cable to the Parent Company, and (ii) 4.5% of its totalleverage exposure.\nIn addition, the final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements\non top of both the risk-based and leverage-exposure-basedexternal TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-basedTLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, the covered BHC\u2019sMethod 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as apercentage of total RWA. The leverage-exposure-basedTLAC buffer is equal to 2% of the covered BHC\u2019s totalleverage exposure. Failure to maintain the TLAC bufferswould result in restrictions on capital distributions and discre-tionary bonus payments to executive officers.\nThe final rule provides permanent grandfathering for debt\ninstruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would beeligible LTD but for having impermissible accelerationclauses or being governed by foreign law.\nFurthermore, under the clean holding company requirements\nof the final rule, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurringany external short-term debt or certain other liabilities,regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or other-wise senior to eligible LTD, or entering into certain otherprohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities,including structured notes, are subject to a cap equal to 5% ofthe covered BHC\u2019s outstanding external TLAC amount.\nThe Federal Reserve has proposed modifications to the\nenhanced SLR that would also make corresponding changesto the calibration of the TLAC leverage-based requirements,as well as certain other technical changes to the TLAC rule.For a further discussion of the enhanced SLR, see \u201cRegula-tory Developments\u2014Proposed Modifications to theEnhanced SLR and to the SLR Applicable to Our U.S. BankSubsidiaries\u201d herein.\nCapital Plans and Stress TestsPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has\nadopted capital planning and stress test requirements for largeBHCs, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserve\u2019sannual CCAR framework.\nWe must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal\nReserve, taking into account the results of separate stress testsdesigned by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the FederalReserve may assess our systems and processes that incorpo-rate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to\nmonitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy.\nThe capital plan must include a description of all planned\ncapital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon,including any issuance or redemption of a debt or equitycapital instrument, any capital distribution ( i.e.,payments of\ndividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action thatthe Federal Reserve determines could impact our consoli-dated capital. The capital plan must include a discussion ofhow we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatorycapital ratios, including the requirements that are phased inover the planning horizon, and serve as a source of strength toour U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stressscenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guid-ance setting out its heightened expectations for capital plan-ning practices at certain large financial institutions, includingus.\nThe capital plan rule requires that large BHCs receive no\nobjection from the Federal Reserve before making a capitaldistribution.

On June 21, 2018, the Federal Reserve\npublished summary results of the Dodd-Frank Act supervi-sory stress tests of each large BHC, including us. On June 28,2018, the Federal Reserve published summary results ofCCAR, and we received a conditional non-objection to ourCapital Plan, where the only condition was that our capitaldistributions not exceed the greater of the actual distributionswe made over the previous four calendar quarters or theannualized average of actual distributions over the previouseight calendar quarters.\nOur 2018 Capital Plan includes the repurchase of up to\n$4.7 billion of outstanding common stock for the periodbeginning July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019 and an increasein our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.30 per share,beginning with the common stock dividend announced onJuly 18, 2018. The total amount of expected 2018 capitaldistributions is consistent with the $6.8 billion of actual divi-dends and gross share repurchases included in our 2017Capital Plan. We disclosed a summary of the results of ourcompany-run stress tests on June 21, 2018 on our InvestorRelations webpage. In addition, we submitted the results ofour mid-cycle company-run stress test to the Federal Reserveand on October 22, 2018 disclosed a summary of the resultson our Investor Relations webpage.\nFor the 2019 capital planning and stress test cycle, we are\nrequired to submit our capital plan and company-run stresstest results to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2019. TheFederal Reserve is expected to publish summary results of theCCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of eachlarge BHC, including us, by June 30, 2019. We are requiredto disclose a summary of the results ofour company-run stress tests within 15 days of the date theFederal Reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stresstests. In addition, we must submit the results ofour mid-cycle company-run stress test to the Federal Reserveby October 5, 2019 and disclose a summary of the resultsbetween October 5, 2019 and November 4, 2019.\nAttribution of Average Common Equity According to the\nRequired Capital Framework\nOur required capital (\u201cRequired Capital\u201d) estimation is based\non the Required Capital framework, an internal capitaladequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the busi-ness segments is based on capital usage calculated under theRequired Capital framework, as well as each businesssegment\u2019s relative contribution to our total Required Capital.\nThe Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage\nuse-of-capital measure, which is compared with our regula-tory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of goingconcern capital after absorbing potential losses from stressevents, where applicable, at a point in time. We define thedifference between our total average common equity and the\nsum of the average common equity amounts allocated to ourbusiness segments as Parent common equity. We generallyhold Parent common equity for prospective regulatoryrequirements, organic growth, acquisitions and other capitalneeds.\nThe estimation and attribution of common equity to the busi-\nness segments are based on the fully phased-in regulatorycapital rules. The amount of capital allocated to the businesssegments is generally set at the beginning of each year andremains fixed throughout the year until the next annual resetunless a significant business change occurs ( e.g., acquisition\nor disposition). Differences between available and RequiredCapital are attributed to Parent common equity during theyear.\nThe Required Capital framework is expected to evolve over\ntime in response to changes in the business and regulatoryenvironment, for example, to incorporate changes in stresstesting or enhancements to modeling techniques.

The Parent Companyhas amended and restated its secured support agreement withits material entities, as defined in our 2017 resolution plan.Under the secured amended and restated support agreement,upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, the ParentCompany would be obligated to contribute or loan on asubordinated basis all of its contributable material assets,other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company andcertain intercompany receivables, to provide capital andliquidity, as applicable, to our material entities.\nDecember 2018 Form 10-K 60", "start_char_idx": 3585, "end_char_idx": 5235, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bcf381a9-bef5-4005-8ab1-dba269850621": {"__data__": {"id_": "bcf381a9-bef5-4005-8ab1-dba269850621", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "913e7195-d3ec-43bb-82d9-f4c5619d5b94", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "78c7d018bcbf0b5944a74c1b9df676ad4bb3b2b756638a7e2cee010cdfa9ce25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "433452c0-1de0-4e34-acab-d26b73c0763e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "38ea4ab1a58563a7ee6e88dd39fbc9589ced2aae29a12194cc4731dd3bf702aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "97430b57-3172-43e3-8aef-4acba2f33ef6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3952b968058034e4516a03c1df5d3b55afdf94938572765702c4f7bd5e0797e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bb73f0394bb8c34a7ea797b4b46ad6a41873d2f0527798960442e7c4b0790467", "text": "Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nThe obligations of the Parent Company under the secured\namended and restated support agreement are in most casessecured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company(other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company). Asa result, claims of our material entities against the assets ofthe Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of theParent Company) are effectively senior to unsecured obliga-tions of the Parent Company.\nIn further development of our SPOE strategy, we have\ncreated a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of the ParentCompany, MS Holdings LLC (the \u201cFunding IHC\u201d), to serveas a resolution funding vehicle. We expect that, prior to thesubmission of our 2019 resolution plan by July 1, 2019, theParent Company will contribute certain of its assets to theFunding IHC and enter into an updated secured amended andrestated support agreement with the Funding IHC as well ascertain other subsidiaries to facilitate the execution of ourSPOE strategy. Similar to the existing secured amended andrestated support agreement, the updated secured amended andrestated support agreement will obligate the Parent Companyto transfer capital and liquidity, as revised, to the FundingIHC, and that the Parent Company and/or the Funding IHCwill recapitalize and provide liquidity to material entities inthe event of our material financial distress or failure.\nFor more information about resolution and recovery planning\nrequirements and our activities in these areas, including theimplications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u2014Financial HoldingCompany\u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning\u201d and \u201cRiskFactors\u2014Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.\u201d\nRegulatory DevelopmentsProposed Stress Buffer RequirementsIn April 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal to inte-\ngrate its annual capital planning and stress testing require-ments with existing applicable regulatory capital require-ments. The proposal, which would apply to certain BHCs,including us, would introduce a stress capital buffer and astress leverage buffer (collectively, \u201cStress Buffer Require-ments\u201d) and related changes to the capital planning and stresstesting processes. Under the proposal, Stress Buffer Require-ments would apply only with respect to StandardizedApproach risk-based capital requirements and Tier 1 leverageregulatory capital requirements.\nUnder Standardized Approach risk-based capital require-\nments, the stress capital buffer would replace the existingCommon Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer, which is2.5% as of January 1, 2019. The Standardized Approachstress capital buffer would equal the greater of (i) themaximum decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratiounder the severely adverse scenario over the supervisorystress test measurement period plus the sum of the ratios of\nthe dollar amount of our planned common stock dividends toour projected RWA for each of the fourth through seventhquarters of the supervisory stress test projection period and(ii) 2.5%. Regulatory capital requirements under the Stan-dardized Approach would include the stress capital buffer, assummarized above, as well as our Common Equity Tier 1G-SIB capital surcharge and any applicable Common EquityTier 1 CCyB.\nLike the stress capital buffer, the stress leverage buffer would\nbe calculated based on the results of our annual supervisorystress tests. The stress leverage buffer would equal themaximum decline in our Tier 1 leverage ratio under theseverely adverse scenario, plus the sum of the ratios of thedollar amount of our planned common stock dividends to ourprojected leverage ratio denominator for each of the fourththrough seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projec-tion period.

A banking organization that has adopted a CECL meth-odology must include the provision for credit losses begin-ning in the 2020 stress test cycle.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve issued a statement that it will\nmaintain the current framework for calculating allowances onloans in the supervisory stress test through the 2021 cycle.\nProposed Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit\nRisk\nThe U.S. banking agencies have issued a proposal to incorpo-\nrate the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk(\u201cSA-CCR\u201d), a new derivatives counterparty exposure meth-odology, into the regulatory capital framework and relatedregulatory standards. As proposed, SA-CCR would replacethe current exposure method, on a mandatory basis, in ourand our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries\u2019 Standardized ApproachRWA, central counterparty default fund contributions and, inmodified form, in Supplementary Leverage Ratio exposurecalculations. SA-CCR would be available as an alternative inour and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries\u2019 Advanced ApproachRWA for trade exposures, in single counterparty credit limits\napplicable to us, and in bank lending limits applicable to ourU.S. Bank Subsidiaries.

We\nbelieve effective risk management is vital to the success ofour business activities. Accordingly, we have an EnterpriseRisk Management (\u201cERM\u201d) framework to integrate thediverse roles of risk management into a holistic enterprisestructure and to facilitate the incorporation of risk assessmentinto decision-making processes across the Firm.\nWe have policies and procedures in place to identify,\nmeasure, monitor, advise, challenge and control the principalrisks involved in the activities of the Institutional Securities,Wealth Management and Investment Management businesssegments, as well as at the Parent Company level. The prin-cipal risks involved in our business activities include market(including non-trading interest rate risk), credit, operational,model, compliance, cybersecurity, liquidity, strategic, reputa-tional and conduct risk. Strategic risk is integrated into ourbusiness planning, embedded in the evaluation of all principalrisks and overseen by the Board.\nThe cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the\npursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk takingthat protects our capital base and franchise. This philosophyis implemented through the ERM framework. Five key prin-ciples underlie this philosophy: integrity, comprehensiveness,independence, accountability and transparency. To helpensure the efficacy of risk management, which is an essentialcomponent of our reputation, senior management requiresthorough and frequent communication and the appropriate\nescalation of risk matters. The fast-paced, complex andconstantly evolving nature of global financial marketsrequires us to maintain a risk management culture that is inci-sive, knowledgeable about specialized products and markets,and subject to ongoing review and enhancement.\nOur risk appetite defines the types of risk that the Firm is\nwilling to accept in pursuit of our strategic objectives andbusiness plan, taking into account the interest of clients andfiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and otherregulatory requirements. This risk appetite is embedded inour risk culture and linked to our short-term and long-termstrategic, capital and financial plans, as well as compensationprograms. This risk appetite and the related Board-level risklimits and risk tolerance statements are reviewed andapproved by the Risk Committee of the Board (\u201cBRC\u201d) andthe Board on at least an annual basis.\nRisk Governance StructureRisk management at the Firm requires independent Firm-\nlevel oversight, accountability of our business divisions, andeffective communication of risk matters across the Firm, tosenior management and ultimately to the Board. Our riskgovernance structure is set forth in the chart below and alsoincludes risk managers, committees, and groups within andacross the business segments and operating legal entities. TheERM framework, composed of independent but complemen-tary entities, facilitates efficient and comprehensive supervi-sion of our risk exposures and processes.\nGovernance Process Review SubcommitteeOperations and Technology Committee Risk Committee Audit CommitteeMorgan Stanley Board\n\u2022 Firm Credit Risk\n\u2022 Asset/Liability Management\n\u2022 Global Compliance\u2022 Model Oversight\n\u2022 Culture, Values and Conduct\n\u2022 Enterprise Regulatory Oversight\u2022 Firm Franchise\n\u2022 Operational Risk Oversight\n\u2022 Technology Governance\u2022 Commitment and Underwriting1\n\u2022 Global Legal Entity Oversight and Governance\n\u2022 Segment Risk2Functional Risk and Control CommitteesChief Executive Officer\nChief Financial Officer\n\u2022 CCAR\n\u2022 RRP\n\u2022 Strategic TransactionsGlobal Audit \nDirectorChief Compliance Officer\nChief Legal OfficerChief Risk Officer\nBusiness/Control Senior ManagementInternal Audit Other CommitteesFirm Risk Committee\n1.

Our risk-taking capacity is sized through the Firm\u2019scapital planning process where losses are estimated under theFirm\u2019s BHC Severely Adverse stress testing scenario. Wealso maintain a comprehensive suite of risk limits and quanti-tative metrics to support and implement our risk appetitestatement. Our risk limits support linkages between theoverall risk appetite, which is reviewed by the Board, andmore granular risk-taking decisions and activities.\nRisk limits, once established, are reviewed and updated on at\nleast an annual basis, with more frequent updates as neces-sary. Board-level risk limits address the most important Firm-wide aggregations of risk, including, but not limited to,stressed market, credit and liquidity risks. Additional risklimits approved by the FRC address more specific types ofrisk and are bound by the higher-level Board risk limits.\nRisk Management Process\nIn subsequent sections we discuss our risk management poli-\ncies and procedures for our primary risks. This discussionprimarily focuses on our Institutional Securities trading activ-ities and corporate lending and related activities. We believethat these activities generate a substantial portion of ourprimary risks. These sections and the estimated amounts ofour risk exposure generated by our statistical analyses areforward-looking statements. However, the analyses used toassess such risks are not predictions of future events, andactual results may vary significantly from such analyses dueto events in the markets in which we operate and certain other\nfactors described in the following paragraphs.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of oneor more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlationsor other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result inlosses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur marketrisk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitationactivities, principally within the Institutional Securities busi-ness segment where the substantial majority of our VaR formarket risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incurnon-trading market risk within the Wealth Management andInvestment Management business segments. The WealthManagement business segment primarily incurs non-tradingmarket risk from lending and deposit-taking activities. TheInvestment Management business segment primarily incursnon-trading market risk from capital investments in alterna-tive and other funds.\nMarket risk includes non-trading interest rate risk.\nNon-trading interest rate risk in the banking book (amountsclassified for regulatory capital purposes under the bankingbook regime) refers to the exposure that a change in interestrates will result in prospective earnings changes for assetsand liabilities in the banking book.\nSound market risk management is an integral part of our\nculture. The various business units and trading desks areresponsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. The control groups help ensure thatthese risks are measured and closely monitored and are madetransparent to senior management. The Market Risk Depart-ment is responsible for ensuring transparency of materialmarket risks, monitoring compliance with established limitsand escalating risk concentrations to appropriate seniormanagement.\nTo execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Depart-\nment monitors our risk against limits on aggregate risk expo-sures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reportsrisk summaries, and maintains our VaR and scenario analysissystems. Market risk is also monitored through variousmeasures: by use of statistics (including VaR and relatedanalytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; andthrough routine stress testing, which measures the impact onthe value of existing portfolios of specified changes in marketfactors and scenarios designed by the Market Risk Depart-ment in collaboration with the business units. The materialrisks identified by these processes are summarized in reportsproduced by the Market Risk Department that are circulatedto and discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRCand the Board.\n67 December 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5435, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0d6580a-3388-4c93-af18-50dd2604a01e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0d6580a-3388-4c93-af18-50dd2604a01e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7334d0f4-c93a-4a19-878c-e104e16b487b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8c0395c7f821bc3ebc3e77fdef6359f8167c5b939d3f71a7e39c80a319cbd8a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f689bf9c-851c-4704-b531-3e6479b09f26", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "26f53fc1d11ac5960574e23a84d9d53ee74369c3d00be805acaf9eb717baa6ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc822081-5051-487d-b931-f9984707ff82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2fe9a4095fbfe87bcf1041222c0cf50ddfc434a1bec163fa7db7fb51e65aa5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d850622e29dba60f124bc6b0c3755d3e1f9635dda9ab39ab62d4020a7f98611f", "text": "Risk Disclosures\nTrading Risks\nPrimary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk\nManagement\nDuring 2018, we had exposures to a wide range of interest\nrates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodityprices\u2014and the associated implied volatilities and spreads\u2014related to the global markets in which we conduct our tradingactivities.\nWe are exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a\nresult of our market-making activities and other trading ininterest rate-sensitive financial instruments ( e.g., risk arising\nfrom changes in the level or implied volatility of interestrates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of theyield curve and credit spreads). The activities from whichthose exposures arise and the markets in which we are activeinclude, but are not limited to, the following: derivatives, andcorporate and government debt across both developed andemerging markets and asset-backed debt, including mortgage-related securities.\nWe are exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a\nresult of making markets in equity securities and derivativesand maintaining other positions, including positions innon-public entities. Positions in non-public entities mayinclude, but are not limited to, exposures to private equity,venture capital, private partnerships, real estate funds andother funds. Such positions are less liquid, have longerinvestment horizons and are more difficult to hedge thanlisted equities.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied vola-\ntility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currenciesand foreign currency derivatives, from maintaining foreignexchange positions and from holding non-U.S. dollar-denominated financial instruments.\nWe are exposed to commodity price and implied volatility\nrisk as a result of market-making activities in commodityproducts related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil andprecious metals. Commodity exposures are subject to periodsof high price volatility as a result of changes in supply anddemand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions;physical production and transportation; or geopolitical andother events that affect the available supply and level ofdemand for these commodities.\nWe manage our trading positions by employing a variety of\nrisk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversifica-tion of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consistof the purchase or sale of positions in related securities andfinancial instruments, including a variety of derivative prod-ucts ( e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). Hedgingactivities may not always provide effective mitigation against\ntrading losses due to differences in the terms, specific charac-teristics or other basis risks that may exist between the hedgeinstrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged.\nWe manage the market risk associated with our trading activ-\nities on a Firm-wide basis, on a worldwide trading divisionlevel and on an individual product basis. We manage andmonitor our market risk exposures in such a way as to main-tain a portfolio that we believe is well-diversified in theaggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflectsour aggregate risk tolerance as established by our seniormanagement.\nAggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Firm\nacross all divisions worldwide. Additional market risk limitsare assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, productsand regions. Trading division risk managers, desk riskmanagers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitormarket risk measures against limits in accordance with poli-cies set by our senior management.\nValue-at-RiskThe statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we\nuse to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposuresof our trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calcu-lates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to variouslevels of management.\nWe estimate VaR using a model based on volatility-adjusted\nhistorical simulation for general market risk factors andMonte Carlo simulation for name-specific risk in corporateshares, bonds, loans and related derivatives. The modelconstructs a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in thevalue of trading portfolios based on historical observation ofdaily changes in key market indices or other market riskfactors, and information on the sensitivity of the portfoliovalues to these market risk factor changes.\nOur VaR model uses four years of historical data with a vola-\ntility adjustment to reflect current market conditions. VaR forrisk management purposes (\u201cManagement VaR\u201d) iscomputed at a 95% level of confidence over a one-day timehorizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading lossesresulting from adverse daily market moves. The 95%/one-dayVaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that,based on historically observed market risk factor movements,would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or fivetimes in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were heldconstant for one day.\nOur VaR model generally takes into account linear and\nnon-linear exposures to equity and commodity price risk,interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange\nDecember 2018 Form 10-K 68", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5232, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc822081-5051-487d-b931-f9984707ff82": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc822081-5051-487d-b931-f9984707ff82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bf20cfaf-83c6-4c2f-b68b-5f5172e764b5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1f93e413f59a233a0b49a42b81185f01c8aabd1c361d4942c73afe5bbf913ac2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0d6580a-3388-4c93-af18-50dd2604a01e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d850622e29dba60f124bc6b0c3755d3e1f9635dda9ab39ab62d4020a7f98611f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e2512623-f58f-4598-9dd8-6955edfd2445", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b79838352d67b14ed729385108b41024ef8ea66daecc21cb01d8791252ee6ce7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d2fe9a4095fbfe87bcf1041222c0cf50ddfc434a1bec163fa7db7fb51e65aa5e", "text": "Risk Disclosures\nrates. The model also takes into account linear exposures to\nimplied volatility risks for all asset classes and non-linearexposures to implied volatility risks for equity, commodityand foreign exchange referenced products. The VaR modelalso captures certain implied correlation risks associated withportfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks ( e.g.,\ncorporate debt and related credit derivatives).\nWe use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools.\nAmong their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of aportfolio\u2019s aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating arange of varied market risks and portfolio assets. One keyelement of the VaR model is that it reflects risk reduction dueto portfolio diversification or hedging activities. However,VaR has various limitations, which include, but are notlimited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors,which may not be accurate predictors of future market condi-tions and may not fully incorporate the risk of extrememarket events that are outsized relative to observed historicalmarket behavior or reflect the historical distribution of resultsbeyond the 95% confidence interval; and reporting of lossesin a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positionsthat cannot be liquidated or hedged in one day. A smallproportion of market risk generated by trading positions isnot included in VaR.\nThe modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions\nrelies on approximations that, under certain circumstances,could produce significantly different results from thoseproduced using more precise measures. VaR is most appro-priate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid finan-cial markets and will understate the risk associated withsevere events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. We areaware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use VaRas only one component in our risk management oversightprocess. This process also incorporates stress testing andscenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis andcontrol at the trading desk, division and Firm levels.\nOur VaR model evolves over time in response to changes in\nthe composition of trading portfolios and to improvements inmodeling techniques and systems capabilities. We arecommitted to continuous review and enhancement of VaRmethodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolvingrisks associated with changes in market structure anddynamics. As part of our regular process improvements, addi-tional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be addedto improve the VaR model\u2019s ability to more accurately esti-mate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors.\nSince the reported VaR statistics are estimates based on\nhistorical data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of ourfuture revenues or financial performance or of our ability tomonitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that our\nactual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaRamounts indicated in the following tables and paragraphs orthat such losses will not occur more than five times in 100trading days for a 95%/one-day VaR. VaR does not predictthe magnitude of losses that, should they occur, may besignificantly greater than the VaR amount.\nVaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms\nbecause of differences in the firms\u2019 portfolios, modelingassumptions and methodologies. These differences can resultin materially different VaR estimates across firms for similarportfolios. The impact of such differences varies dependingon the factor history assumptions, the frequency with whichthe factor history is updated and the confidence level. As aresult, VaR statistics are more useful when interpreted asindicators of trends in a firm\u2019s risk profile rather than as anabsolute measure of risk to be compared across firms.\nOur regulators have approved the same VaR model we use for\nrisk management purposes for use in regulatory calculations.\nThe portfolio of positions used for Management VaR differs\nfrom that used for Regulatory VaR.

Assuming no intraday trading, for a 95%/one-day VaR,the expected number of times that trading losses shouldexceed VaR during the year is 13, and, in general, if tradinglosses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, theadequacy of the VaR model would be questioned.\nWe evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by\ncomparing the potential declines in portfolio values generatedby the model with corresponding actual trading results for theFirm, as well as individual business units. For days wherelosses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers oftrading losses to evaluate the VaR model\u2019s accuracy relativeto realized trading results.

These shocks are applied to our 12-monthforecast for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, which incorporatesmarket expectations of interest rates and our forecasted busi-ness activity.\nWe do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather\nmanage net interest income in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries tooptimize across a range of possible outcomes, includingnon-parallel rate change scenarios. The sensitivity analysisassumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios,assumes there are no changes in other macroeconomic varia-bles normally correlated with changes in interest rates, andincludes subjective assumptions regarding customer andmarket re-pricing behavior and other factors. The change insensitivity to interest rates between December 31, 2018 andDecember 31, 2017 is related to overall changes in our asset-liability profile and higher market rates.Investments Sensitivity, Including Related Performance Fees\nLoss from 10% Decline\n$ in millionsAt\nDecember 31,\n2018At\nDecember 31,\n2017\nInvestments related to Investment\nManagement activities $ 298 $ 316\nOther investments:\nMUMSS 165 168\nOther Firm investments 179 178\nMUMSS\u2014Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd.\nWe have exposure to public and private companies through\ndirect investments, as well as through funds that invest inthese assets. These investments are predominantly equitypositions with long investment horizons, a portion of which isfor business facilitation purposes. The market risk related tothese investments is measured by estimating the potentialreduction in net income associated with a 10% decline ininvestment values and related impact on performance fees.\nEquity Market SensitivityIn the Wealth Management and Investment Management\nbusiness segments, certain fee-based revenue streams aredriven by the value of clients\u2019 equity holdings. The overalllevel of revenues for these streams also depends on multipleadditional factors that include, but are not limited to, the leveland duration of the equity market increase or decline, pricevolatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets,the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemp-tions, and the impact of such market increase or decline andprice volatility on client behavior.

CRM approvesextensions of credit, evaluates the creditworthiness of thecounterparties and borrowers on a regular basis, and helpsensure that credit exposure is actively monitored andmanaged. The evaluation of counterparties and borrowersincludes an assessment of the probability that an obligor willdefault on its financial obligations and any losses that mayoccur when an obligor defaults. In addition, credit risk expo-sure is actively managed by credit professionals and commit-tees within CRM and through various risk committees, whosemembership includes individuals from CRM. A comprehen-sive and global Credit Limits Framework is utilized tomanage credit risk levels across the Firm. The Credit LimitsFramework is calibrated within our risk tolerance andincludes single-name limits and portfolio concentration limitsby country, industry and product type.\nCRM helps ensure timely and transparent communication of\nmaterial credit risks, compliance with established limits andescalation of risk concentrations to appropriate seniormanagement. CRM also works closely with the Market RiskDepartment and applicable business units to monitor riskexposures and to perform stress tests to identify, analyze andcontrol credit risk concentrations arising from lending and\ntrading activities. The stress tests shock market factors ( e.g.,\ninterest rates, commodity prices, credit spreads), risk parame-ters ( e.g., default probabilities and loss given default),\nrecovery rates and expected losses in order to assess theimpact of stresses on exposures, profit and loss, and ourcapital position. Stress tests are conducted in accordance withour established policies and procedures.\nCredit EvaluationThe evaluation of corporate and institutional counterparties\nand borrowers includes assigning obligor credit ratings,which reflect an assessment of an obligor\u2019s probability ofdefault and loss given default. Credit evaluations typicallyinvolve the assessment of financial statements; leverage;liquidity; capital strength; asset composition and quality;market capitalization; access to capital markets; adequacy ofcollateral, if applicable; and in the case of certain loans, cashflow projections and debt service requirements. CRM alsoevaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics,management and other factors that could affect the obligor\u2019srisk profile. Additionally, CRM evaluates the relative posi-tion of our exposure in the borrower\u2019s capital structure andrelative recovery prospects, as well as other structuralelements of the particular transaction.\nThe evaluation of consumer borrowers is tailored to the\nspecific type of lending. Margin and securities-based loansare evaluated based on factors that include, but are notlimited to, the amount of the loan, the degree of leverage andthe quality, diversification, price volatility and liquidity of thecollateral. The underwriting of residential real estate loansincludes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor\u2019s income,net worth, liquidity, collateral, loan-to-value ratio and creditbureau information. Subsequent credit monitoring for indi-vidual loans is performed at the portfolio level, and collateralvalues are monitored on an ongoing basis.\nCredit risk metrics assigned to our borrowers during the eval-\nuation process are incorporated into CRM maintenance of theallowance for loan losses for loans held for investment. Suchallowance serves as a reserve for probable inherent losses, aswell as probable losses related to loans identified asimpaired.

We also purchase a variety of loans in the secondarymarket. Our loans and lending commitments may havevarying terms; may be senior or subordinated; may besecured or unsecured; are generally contingent upon repre-sentations, warranties and contractual conditions applicableto the borrower; and may be syndicated, traded or hedged byus.\nWe also participate in securitization activities, whereby we\nextend short- or long-term collateralized lines of credit andterm loans with various types of collateral, including residen-tial real estate, commercial real estate, corporate and financialassets. These collateralized loans and lending commitmentsgenerally provide for over-collateralization. Credit risk withrespect to these loans and lending commitments arises fromthe failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms ofthe loan agreement or a decline in the underlying collateralvalue. The Firm monitors collateral levels against the require-ments of lending agreements.

The LAL platform allows the client toborrow money against the value of qualifying securities,generally for any purpose other than purchasing securities.We establish approved credit lines against qualifying securi-ties and monitor limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines,require customers to deposit additional collateral, orreduce debt positions, when necessary. These credit lines areprimarily uncommitted loan facilities, as we reserve the rightto not make any advances or may terminate these credit linesat any time. Factors considered in the review of these loansinclude, but are not limited to, the loan amount, the client\u2019scredit profile, the degree of leverage, collateral diversifica-tion, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral.\nResidential real estate loans consist of first and second lien\nmortgages, including HELOCs. Our underwriting policy isdesigned to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment ofcapacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysisutilizing industry standard credit scoring models ( e.g., FICO\nscores), debt ratios and assets of the borrower. Loan-to-valueratios are determined based on independent third-party prop-erty appraisals and valuations, and security lien positions areestablished through title and ownership reports.

The buyer typically pays a periodic premium over thelife of the contract and is protected for the period. If a creditevent occurs, the seller is required to make payment to thebeneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivativecontract. Credit events, as defined in the contract, may be oneor more of the following defined events: bankruptcy, dissolu-tion or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay,obligation acceleration, repudiation, payment moratorium andrestructurings.\nWe trade in a variety of credit derivatives and may either\npurchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio ofreferenced entities. In transactions referencing a portfolio ofentities or securities, protection may be limited to a tranche ofexposure or a single name within the portfolio. We are anactive market maker in the credit derivatives markets. As amarket maker, we work to earn a bid-offer spread on clientflow business and manage any residual credit or correlationrisk on a portfolio basis. Further, we use credit derivatives tomanage our exposure to residential and commercial mortgage\nloans and corporate lending exposures. The effectiveness ofour CDS protection as a hedge of our exposures may varydepending upon a number of factors, including the contrac-tual terms of the CDS.\nWe actively monitor our counterparty credit risk related to\ncredit derivatives. A majority of our counterparties arecomposed of banks, broker-dealers, insurance and otherfinancial institutions. Contracts with these counterparties mayinclude provisions related to counterparty rating downgrades,which may result in the counterparty posting additionalcollateral to us. As with all derivative contracts, we considercounterparty credit risk in the valuation of our positions andrecognize CVAs as appropriate within Trading revenues inthe income statements.\nFor additional credit exposure information on our credit\nderivative portfolio, see Note 4 to the financial statementsand \u201cSingle Name and Index Credit Derivatives Included inNet Inventory\u201d herein.\nCountry Risk\nCountry risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect,a foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) mightadversely affect us. We actively manage country risk expo-sure through a comprehensive risk management frameworkthat combines credit and market fundamentals and allows usto effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk.Country risk exposure before and after hedging is monitoredand managed.\nOur obligor credit evaluation process may also identify indi-\nrect exposures, whereby an obligor has vulnerability or expo-sure to another country or jurisdiction. Examples of indirectexposures include mutual funds that invest in a singlecountry, offshore companies whose assets reside in anothercountry to that of the offshore jurisdiction and financecompany subsidiaries of corporations. Indirect exposuresidentified through the credit evaluation process may result ina reclassification of country risk.\nWe conduct periodic stress testing that seeks to measure the\nimpact on our credit and market exposures of shocks stem-ming from negative economic or political scenarios. Whendeemed appropriate by our risk managers, the stress testscenarios include possible contagion effects and second orderrisks. This analysis, and results of the stress tests, may resultin the amendment of limits or exposure mitigation.\nIn addition to our country risk exposure, we disclose our\ncross-border risk exposure in \u201cFinancial Statements andSupplementary Data\u2014Financial Data Supplement(Unaudited).\u201d It is based on the FFIEC regulatory guidelines\n77 December 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4846, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7948997b-c3ce-4964-b564-db2c4008a3af": {"__data__": {"id_": "7948997b-c3ce-4964-b564-db2c4008a3af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f28f5be-d866-4031-a7c0-609f1dff7411", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "bdcdeaece1d481a0b6e224d5f76e11a2450cbc3253e0051fd33464383fb0494b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3755b08a-7a08-4861-b2ef-e1eb4b62fc7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2e94db2123b4cebb87a3c249e9b65f6700fe3067ef9e842d2ba1f9014e1937d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "695c717d-6b6a-4fca-b58a-8302253e52c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63bbd54c97fa4459d8ffd67bb84fb5e35ee38c3996684c48c33a49ed164ee6db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4896663b3f78b4f96bf0c55f643d7af6c5ed09dc377521d28eec7272ecd4894d", "text": "Risk Disclosures\nfor reporting cross-border information and represents the\namounts that we may not be able to obtain from a foreigncountry due to country-specific events, including unfavorableeconomic and political conditions, economic and social insta-bility, and changes in government policies.\nThere can be substantial differences between our country risk\nexposure and cross-border risk exposure. For instance, unlikethe cross-border risk exposure, our country risk exposureincludes the effect of certain risk mitigants. In addition, thebasis for determining the domicile of the country risk expo-sure is different from the basis for determining the cross-border risk exposure. Cross-border risk exposure is reportedbased on the country of jurisdiction for the obligor or guar-antor.

Examples ofactivities include: continuous enhancement of defensesagainst cyber attacks; use of legal agreements and contractsto transfer and/or limit operational risk exposures; due dili-gence; implementation of enhanced policies and procedures;technology change management controls; exception manage-ment processing controls; and segregation of duties.\nPrimary responsibility for the management of operational risk\nis with the business segments, the control groups and thebusiness managers therein. The business managers maintainprocesses and controls designed to identify, assess, manage,mitigate and report operational risk. Each of the businesssegments has a designated operational risk coordinator. Theoperational risk coordinator regularly reviews operational riskissues and reports to our senior management within eachbusiness. Each control group also has a designated opera-tional risk coordinator and a forum for discussing operationalrisk matters with our senior management. Oversight of opera-tional risk is provided by the Operational Risk OversightCommittee, legal entity risk committees, regional riskcommittees and senior management. In the event of a merger;joint venture; divestiture; reorganization; or creation of a newlegal entity, a new product, or a business activity, operationalrisks are considered, and any necessary changes in processesor controls are implemented.\nThe Operational Risk Department provides independent over-\nsight of operational risk and assesses, measures and monitorsoperational risk against tolerance.

These policies and procedures cover a broad range of\nareas, including: identification of internal and externalthreats, access control, data security, protective controls,detection of malicious or unauthorized activity, incidentresponse and recovery planning.\nBusiness Continuity Management and Disaster RecoveryWe maintain global programs for business continuity\nmanagement and technology disaster recovery that facilitateactivities designed to mitigate risk to the Firm during a busi-ness continuity event. A business continuity event is an inter-ruption with potential impact to normal business activity ofthe Firm\u2019s people, operations, technology, suppliers and/orfacilities. The business continuity management program\u2019score functions are business continuity planning and crisismanagement. As part of business continuity planning, busi-ness units within the Firm maintain business continuity plans,identifying processes and strategies to continue business-critical processes during a business continuity event. Crisismanagement is the process of identifying and managing theFirm\u2019s operations during business continuity events. Disasterrecovery plans supporting business continuity are in place forcritical facilities and resources across the Firm.\nThird Party Risk ManagementIn connection with our ongoing operations, we utilize the\nservices of third party suppliers, which we anticipate willcontinue and may increase in the future. These servicesinclude, for example, outsourced processing and supportfunctions and other professional services. Our risk-basedapproach to managing exposure to these services includes theperformance of due diligence, implementation of servicelevel and other contractual agreements, consideration ofoperational risks and ongoing monitoring of third-partysuppliers\u2019 performance. We maintain and continue to enhanceour third-party risk management program which includesappropriate governance, policies, procedures and technologythat supports alignment with our risk tolerance and isdesigned to meet regulatory requirements. The third-partyrisk management program includes the adoption of appro-priate risk management controls and practices through thesupplier management life cycle, including, but not limited to,assessment of information security, service failure, financialstability, disaster recoverability, reputational risk, contractualrisk and safeguards against corruption.\nModel Risk\nModel risk refers to the potential for adverse consequencesfrom decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs.Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and stra-tegic decision making or damage to a Firm\u2019s reputation.

The Model Risk ManagementDepartment (\u201cMRM\u201d) is a distinct department in RiskManagement responsible for the oversight of model risk.\nMRM establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our risk\nappetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the mate-riality of the risk of financial loss or reputational damage dueto errors in design, implementation and/or inappropriate useof models. The tolerance is monitored through model-specificand aggregate business-level assessments, which are basedupon qualitative and quantitative factors.\nA guiding principle for managing model risk is the \u201ceffective\nchallenge\u201d of models. The effective challenge of models isrepresented by the critical analysis by objective, informedparties who can identify model limitations and assumptionsand drive appropriate changes. MRM provides effective chal-lenge of models, independently validates and approvesmodels for use, annually recertifies models, identifies andtracks remediation plans for model limitations and reports onmodel risk metrics. The department also oversees the devel-opment of controls to support a complete and accurate Firm-wide model inventory.

Liquidity riskalso encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet ourfinancial obligations without experiencing significant businessdisruption or reputational damage that may threaten ourviability as a going concern. Liquidity risk also encompassesthe associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyn-cratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity andmay impact our ability to raise new funding. Generally, weincur liquidity and funding risk as a result of our trading,lending, investing and client facilitation activities.\nOur Liquidity Risk Management Framework is critical to\nhelping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reservesand durable funding sources to meet our daily obligations andto withstand unanticipated stress events. The Liquidity RiskDepartment is a distinct area in Risk Management responsiblefor the oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk. TheLiquidity Risk Department ensures transparency of material\nliquidity and funding risks, compliance with established risklimits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriatesenior management.\nTo execute these responsibilities, the Liquidity Risk Depart-\nment establishes limits in line with our risk appetite, identi-fies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks toensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors andreports risk exposures against metrics and limits, and reviewsthe methodologies and assumptions underpinning ourLiquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity andfunding under a range of adverse scenarios. The liquidity andfunding risks identified by these processes are summarized inreports produced by the Liquidity Risk Department that arecirculated to and discussed with senior management, theFRC, the BRC and the Board, as appropriate.\nThe Treasury Department and applicable business units have\nprimary responsibility for evaluating, monitoring and control-ling the liquidity and funding risks arising from our businessactivities and for maintaining processes and controls tomanage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. TheLiquidity Risk Department coordinates with the TreasuryDepartment and these business units to help ensure a consis-tent and comprehensive framework for managing liquidityand funding risk across the Firm.

Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation\nThe Firm\nMorgan Stanley is a global financial services firm that main-\ntains significant market positions in each of its businesssegments\u2014Institutional Securities, Wealth Management andInvestment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsid-iaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products andservices to a large and diversified group of clients andcustomers, including corporations, governments, financialinstitutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwiserequires, the terms \u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d meanMorgan Stanley (the \u201cParent Company\u201d) together with itsconsolidated subsidiaries. See the \u201cGlossary of CommonAcronyms\u201d for the definition of certain acronyms usedthroughout the 2018 Form 10-K.\nA description of the clients and principal products and\nservices of each of the Firm\u2019s business segments is asfollows:\nInstitutional Securities provides investment banking, sales\nand trading, lending and other services to corporations,governments, financial institutions, and high to ultra-highnet worth clients. Investment banking services consist ofcapital raising and financial advisory services, includingservices relating to the underwriting of debt, equity andother securities, as well as advice on mergers and acquisi-tions, restructurings, real estate and project finance. Salesand trading services include sales, financing, primebrokerage and market-making activities in equity and fixedincome products, including foreign exchange and commod-ities. Lending activities include originating corporate loans,commercial mortgage lending, asset-backed lending andfinancing extended to sales and trading customers. Otheractivities include investments and research.\nWealth Management provides a comprehensive array of\nfinancial services and solutions to individual investors andsmall to medium-sized businesses and institutions coveringbrokerage and investment advisory services; financial andwealth planning services; annuity and insurance products;securities-based lending, residential real estate loans andother lending products; banking and retirement planservices.\nInvestment Management provides a broad range of invest-\nment strategies and products that span geographies, assetclasses, and public and private markets to a diverse groupof clients across institutional and intermediary channels.Strategies and products include equity, fixed income,liquidity and alternative/other products. Institutional clientsinclude defined benefit/defined contribution plans, founda-tions, endowments, government entities, sovereign wealthfunds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and\ncorporations. Individual clients are served throughintermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliateddistributors.\nBasis of Financial InformationThe consolidated financial statements (\u201cfinancial state-\nments\u201d) are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, whichrequire the Firm to make estimates and assumptionsregarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, thevaluation of goodwill and intangible assets, compensation,deferred tax assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters,allowance for credit losses and other matters that affect itsfinancial statements and related disclosures. The Firmbelieves that the estimates utilized in the preparation of itsfinancial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actualresults could differ materially from these estimates. Intercom-pany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certainreclassifications have been made to prior periods to conformto the current presentation.\nConsolidationThe financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its\nwholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which theFirm has a controlling financial interest, including certainVIEs (see Note 13). For consolidated subsidiaries that are lessthan wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity inter-ests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. The netincome attributable to noncontrolling interests for suchsubsidiaries is presented as Net income applicable to noncon-trolling interests in the consolidated income statements(\u201cincome statements\u201d). The portion of shareholders\u2019 equitythat is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsid-iaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a component oftotal equity, in the consolidated balance sheets (\u201cbalancesheets\u201d).\nFor entities where the total equity investment at risk is suffi-\ncient to enable the entity to finance its activities without addi-tional subordinated financial support and the equity holdersbear the economic residual risks and returns of the entity andhave the power to direct the activities of the entity that mostsignificantly affect its economic performance, the Firmconsolidates those entities it controls either through amajority voting interest or otherwise. For VIEs ( i.e., entities\nthat do not meet the aforementioned criteria), the Firmconsolidates those entities where it has the power to make thedecisions that most significantly affect the economic perfor-mance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses orthe right to receive benefits that could potentially be signifi-cant to the VIE.\n89 December 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5269, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caa5c874-b969-4b91-b81e-c523b4f2806f": {"__data__": {"id_": "caa5c874-b969-4b91-b81e-c523b4f2806f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ba392aa-0edd-4a58-a2bd-d69903c2417c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c05f15f3c75369f65d27d65b4944a38ad26b14f508484109f0f8c695a5c9665c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "718f3d47-8ffb-4c36-b0b0-a5517e617399", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "7d3a56087b51d7ed2d5c25310f9417c150961289c7c92bdb81ee6835252b0b66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "03ac02aa-686e-4de9-b0ac-6bd9fdc16560", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "137e6aa4384a3cdfb59489a40a9b6becaea9b273fbc9670c68b294b3e796406e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fe59bd6f91c1a1a9819e4314f0176c0d5dd1d273f3907218730dfba9c00db29e", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor investments in entities in which the Firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest but has significant influenceover operating and financial decisions, it applies the equitymethod of accounting with net gains and losses recordedwithin Other revenues (see Note 8) unless the Firm haselected to measure the investment at fair value, in which casenet gains and losses are recorded within Investments revenues(see Note 3).\nEquity and partnership interests held by entities qualifying for\naccounting purposes as investment companies are carried atfair value.\nThe Firm\u2019s significant regulated U.S. and international\nsubsidiaries include Morgan Stanley & Co.

Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when the promised goods or\nservices are delivered to our customers, in an amount that isbased on the consideration the Firm expects to receive inexchange for those goods or services when such amounts arenot probable of significant reversal. These policies reflect theadoption of Revenue from Contracts with Customers on\nJanuary 1, 2018. Please see \u201cAccounting Updates Adopted\u201dherein for the more significant differences in policies appliedin prior periods.\nInvestment BankingRevenues from investment banking activities consist of reve-\nnues earned from underwriting primarily equity and fixedincome securities and advisory fees for mergers, acquisitions,restructurings and advisory assignments.Underwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date\nif there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amountto be paid. Underwriting costs are deferred and recognized inthe relevant non-interest expenses line items when the relatedunderwriting revenues are recorded.\nAdvisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the\nclient, based on the estimated progress of work and whenrevenues are not probable of a significant reversal. Advisorycosts are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interestexpenses line items, including when reimbursed.\nCommissions and FeesCommission and fee revenues result from transaction-based\narrangements in which the client is charged a fee for theexecution of transactions. Such revenues primarily arise fromtransactions in equity securities; services related to sales andtrading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternativefunds, futures, insurance products and options. Commissionand fee revenues are recognized on trade date when theperformance obligation is satisfied.\nAsset Management RevenuesAsset management, distribution and administration fees are\ngenerally based on related asset levels being managed, suchas the AUM of a customer\u2019s account or the net asset value ofa fund. These fees are generally recognized when services areperformed and the fees become known. Management fees arereduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any,provided to the customer.\nPerformance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are\nrecorded when the annual performance target is met and therevenues are not probable of a significant reversal.\nSales commissions paid by the Firm in connection with the\nsale of certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fundproducts are accounted for as deferred commission assets andamortized to expense over the expected life of the contract.The Firm periodically tests deferred commission assets forrecoverability based on cash flows expected to be received infuture periods. Other asset management and distribution costsare recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interestexpenses line items.\nCarried InterestThe Firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees in the\nform of carried interest when the return on assets undermanagement exceeds certain benchmark returns or otherperformance targets. When the Firm earns carried interestfrom funds as specified performance thresholds are met, thatcarried interest and any related general or limited partnerinterest is accounted for under the equity method of\nDecember 2018 Form 10-K 90", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4921, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03ac02aa-686e-4de9-b0ac-6bd9fdc16560": {"__data__": {"id_": "03ac02aa-686e-4de9-b0ac-6bd9fdc16560", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e0f381f-acbb-4beb-b03b-9cced4b753c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "193d70c024ccaa2d296db8c0f67dc829316bee90a1f3eb7134a85c580b7c3ebc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "caa5c874-b969-4b91-b81e-c523b4f2806f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "fe59bd6f91c1a1a9819e4314f0176c0d5dd1d273f3907218730dfba9c00db29e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "daff0ca7-4d6c-4c48-ba64-3ac63132657c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15c4f77d421000d504ca9598a966bb7db00148e6561952121fb0108fb238639a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "137e6aa4384a3cdfb59489a40a9b6becaea9b273fbc9670c68b294b3e796406e", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\naccounting and measured based on the Firm\u2019s claim on the\nNAV of the fund at the reporting date, taking into account thedistribution terms applicable to the interest held.\nSee Note 21 for information regarding the net cumulative\nunrealized amount of performance-based fee revenues at riskof reversal.

Reve-nues are not discounted when payment is expected within oneyear.\nThe Firm presents, net within revenues, all taxes assessed by\na governmental authority that are both imposed on andconcurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction andcollected by the Firm from a customer.\nFair Value of Financial InstrumentsInstruments within Trading assets and Trading liabilities are\nmeasured at fair value, either as required by accounting guid-ance or through the fair value option election (discussedbelow). These financial instruments primarily represent theFirm\u2019s trading and investment positions and include bothcash and derivative products. In addition, debt and equitysecurities classified as AFS securities are measured at fairvalue.\nGains and losses on instruments carried at fair value are\nreflected in Trading revenues, Investments revenues orInvestment banking revenues in the income statements,except for AFS securities (see \u201cInvestment Securities\u2014AFSand HTM securities\u201d section herein and Note 5) and deriva-tives accounted for as hedges (see \u201cHedge Accounting\u201dsection herein and Note 4).Interest income and interest expense are recorded within the\nincome statements depending on the nature of the instrumentand related market conventions. When interest is included asa component of the instruments\u2019 fair value, interest isincluded within Trading revenues or Investments reve-nues. Otherwise, it is included within Interest income orInterest expense. Dividend income is recorded in Tradingrevenues or Investments revenues depending on the businessactivity.\nThe fair value of OTC financial instruments, including deriv-\native contracts related to financial instruments and commod-ities, is presented in the accompanying balance sheets on anet-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. Additionally,the Firm nets the fair value of cash collateral paid or receivedagainst the fair value amounts recognized for net derivativepositions executed with the same counterparty under the samemaster netting agreement.\nFair Value OptionThe Firm has elected to measure certain eligible instruments\nat fair value, including certain Securities purchased underagreements to resell, loans and lending commitments, equitymethod investments, Deposits ( i.e., structured certificates of\ndeposit), Securities sold under agreements to repurchase,Other secured financings and Borrowings (primarily struc-tured notes).\nFair Value Measurement\u2014Definition and HierarchyFair value is defined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ( i.e., the \u201cexit\nprice\u201d) in an orderly transaction between market participantsat the measurement date.\nFair value is a market-based measure considered from the\nperspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptionsare not readily available, assumptions are set to reflect thosethat the Firm believes market participants would use inpricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Wherethe Firm manages a group of financial assets, financial liabil-ities, and nonfinancial items accounted for as derivatives onthe basis of its net exposure to either market risks or creditrisk, the Firm measures the fair value of that group of finan-cial instruments consistently with how market participantswould price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.\nIn determining fair value, the Firm uses various valuation\napproaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used inmeasuring fair value that requires the most observable inputsbe used when available.\nObservable inputs are inputs that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability that were developed based\n91 December 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5075, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "daff0ca7-4d6c-4c48-ba64-3ac63132657c": {"__data__": {"id_": "daff0ca7-4d6c-4c48-ba64-3ac63132657c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "650da40b-dd39-45fb-8f1e-46498366485f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9899279b5ca617edc1dace8d85cb02971d441dfb13887c7a840d3a2a0f4c0bb6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "03ac02aa-686e-4de9-b0ac-6bd9fdc16560", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "137e6aa4384a3cdfb59489a40a9b6becaea9b273fbc9670c68b294b3e796406e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "62caa324-30a2-4461-ad7e-c78e0f77bf74", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d2033379524f6c1dcde97fffe666e92e19f1e71b59dc85449a019fac34db520", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "15c4f77d421000d504ca9598a966bb7db00148e6561952121fb0108fb238639a", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\non market data obtained from sources independent of the\nFirm. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptionsthe Firm believes other market participants would use inpricing the asset or liability that are developed based on thebest information available in the circumstances. The fairvalue hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on theobservability of inputs as follows, with Level 1 being thehighest and Level 3 being the lowest level:\nLevel 1. Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets\nthat the Firm has the ability to access for identical assets orliabilities. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are notapplied to Level 1 instruments. Since valuations are based onquoted prices that are readily and regularly available in anactive market, valuation of these products does not entail asignificant degree of judgment.\nLevel 2. Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active or for which all significant inputsare observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3. Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable\nand significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from product to\nproduct and is affected by a wide variety of factors, forexample, the type of product, whether the product is new andnot yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity ofmarkets and other characteristics particular to the product. Tothe extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that areless observable or unobservable in the market, the determina-tion of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, thedegree of judgment exercised by the Firm in determining fairvalue is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3 of thefair value hierarchy.\nThe Firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the\nmeasurement date, including during periods of market disloca-tion. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of pricesand inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This conditioncould cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 toLevel 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may\nfall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. Insuch cases, the total fair value amount is disclosed in the levelappropriate for the lowest level input that is significant to thetotal fair value of the asset or liability.\nValuation TechniquesMany cash instruments and OTC derivative contracts have\nbid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace.Bid prices reflect the highest price that a party is willing topay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that aparty is willing to accept for an asset. The Firm carries posi-\ntions at the point within the bid-ask range that meets its bestestimate of fair value. For offsetting positions in the samefinancial instrument, the same price within the bid-ask spreadis used to measure both the long and short positions.\nFair value for many cash instruments and OTC derivative\ncontracts is derived using pricing models. Pricing modelstake into account the contract terms, as well as multipleinputs, including, where applicable, commodity prices, equityprices, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation,creditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of theFirm, option volatility and currency rates.\nWhere appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account\nfor various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments),credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk.Adjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derivedmid-market levels of Level 2 and Level 3 financial instrumentsfor the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflectthe exit price of a risk position. Bid-mid and mid-ask spreadsare marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotesor other external third-party data. Where these spreads areunobservable for the particular position in question, spreads arederived from observable levels of similar positions.\nThe Firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its\nBorrowings (primarily structured notes) for which the fairvalue option was elected and to OTC derivatives. The Firmconsiders the impact of changes in its own credit spreadsbased upon observations of the secondary bond marketspreads when measuring the fair value for Borrowings.\nFor OTC derivatives, the impact of changes in both the\nFirm\u2019s and the counterparty\u2019s credit rating is consideredwhen measuring fair value.

Where possible,these adjustments are based on observablemarket information, but in many instances, significant judg-ment is required to estimate the costs of closingout concentrated risk exposures due to the lack of liquidity inthe marketplace.\nThe Firm applies an FVA in the fair value measurements of\nOTC uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivativesand in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agree-ment do not permit the reuse of the collateral received. Ingeneral, FVA reflects a market funding risk premium inherentin the noted derivative instruments. The methodology formeasuring FVA leverages the Firm\u2019s existing credit-relatedvaluation adjustment calculation methodologies, which applyto both assets and liabilities.\nSee Note 3 for a description of valuation techniques applied\nto the major categories of financial instruments measured atfair value.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a\nNon-recurring Basis\nCertain of the Firm\u2019s assets and liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue on a non-recurring basis. The Firm incurs losses orgains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fairvalue.\nFor assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nnon-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using variousvaluation approaches. The same hierarchy for inputs asdescribed above, which requires that observable inputs beused when available, is used in measuring fair value for theseitems.\nFor further information on financial assets and liabilities that\nare measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurringbasis, see Note 3.\nOffsetting of Derivative InstrumentsIn connection with its derivative activities, the Firm generally\nenters into master netting agreements and collateral agree-ments with its counterparties. These agreements provide theFirm with the right, in the event of a default by the counter-party, to net a counterparty\u2019s rights and obligations under theagreement and to liquidate and set off collateral against anynet amount owed by the counterparty.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, the Firm may not have\nsuch an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regimemay not support the enforceability of the master nettingagreement or collateral agreement; or the Firm may not havesought legal advice to support the enforceability of the agree-\nment. In cases where the Firm has not determined an agree-ment to be enforceable, the related amounts are not offset(see Note 4).\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is generally to receive securities and cash\nposted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), irrespec-tive of the enforceability determination regarding the masternetting and collateral agreement. In certain cases, the Firmmay agree for such collateral to be posted to a third-partycustodian under a control agreement that enables it to takecontrol of such collateral in the event of a counterpartydefault. The enforceability of the master netting agreement istaken into account in the Firm\u2019s risk management practicesand application of counterparty credit limits.\nFor information related to offsetting of derivatives and certain\ncollateralized transactions, see Notes 4 and 6, respectively.\nHedge AccountingThe Firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative\nfinancial instruments for the following types of hedges:hedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilitiesdue to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedgesof net investments in foreign operations whose functionalcurrency is different from the reporting currency of the ParentCompany (net investment hedges). These financial instru-ments are included within Trading assets\u2014Derivative andother contracts or Trading liabilities\u2014Derivative and othercontracts in the balance sheets. For hedges where hedgeaccounting is being applied, the Firm performs effectivenesstesting and other procedures.\nFair Value Hedges\u2014Interest Rate RiskThe Firm\u2019s designated fair value hedges consist primarily of\ninterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of changesin the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate seniorborrowings. In the third quarter of 2018, the Firm also begandesignating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges ofchanges in the benchmark interest rate of certain AFS securi-ties. The Firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the,contractual term of the hedged instrument. The Firm usesregression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective andretrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedgingrelationships.

Interest income, including amortization of premiumsand accretion of discounts on HTM securities, is included inInterest income in the income statements.Other-than-Temporary Impairment\nAFS debt securities and HTM securities with a current fair value\nless than their amortized cost are analyzed as part of the Firm\u2019speriodic assessment of temporary versus OTTI at the individualsecurity level. A temporary impairment is recognized in AOCIfor AFS debt securities. OTTI is recognized in the income state-ments with the exception of the non-credit portion related to adebt security that the Firm does not intend to sell and is not likelyto be required to sell, which is recognized in AOCI.\nFor AFS debt securities that the Firm either has the intent tosell or that the Firm is likely to be required to sell beforerecovery of its amortized cost basis, the impairment is consid-ered OTTI.\nFor those AFS debt securities that the Firm does not have the\nintent to sell or is not likely to be required to sell, and for allHTM securities, the Firm evaluates whether it expects torecover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. Ifthe Firm does not expect to recover the entire amortized costof those AFS debt securities or HTM securities, the impair-ment is considered OTTI, and the Firm determines whatportion of the impairment relates to a credit loss and whatportion relates to non-credit factors.\nA credit loss exists if the present value of cash flows expected\nto be collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate

If the equity security is considered other-than-temporarily impaired, the entire OTTI ( i.e., the difference\nbetween the fair value recorded in the balance sheet and thecost basis) will be recognized in the income statements.\nLoansThe Firm accounts for loans based on the following catego-\nries: loans held for investment; loans held for sale; and loansat fair value.\nLoans Held for InvestmentLoans held for investment are reported at outstanding prin-\ncipal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for loanlosses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs for originatedloans, and any unamortized premiums or discounts forpurchased loans.\nInterest Income. Interest income on performing loans held\nfor investment is accrued and recognized as interest incomeat the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts orpremiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, areamortized into interest income over the life of the loan toproduce a level rate of return.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses\nrepresents an estimate of probable losses related to loansspecifically identified for impairment in addition to the prob-able losses inherent in the held-for-investment loan portfolio.\nThe Firm utilizes the U.S. banking agencies\u2019 definition of\ncriticized exposures, which consist of the Special Mention,Substandard, Doubtful and Loss categories as credit qualityindicators. For further information on the credit quality indi-cators, see Note 7. Substandard loans are regularly reviewedfor impairment. Factors considered by management whendetermining impairment include payment status, fair value of\ncollateral, and probability of collecting scheduled principaland interest payments when due. The impairment analysisrequired depends on the nature and type of loans. Loans clas-sified as Doubtful or Loss are considered impaired.\nThere are two components of the allowance for loan losses:\nthe specific allowance component and the inherent allowancecomponent.\nThe specific allowance component of the allowance for loan\nlosses is used to estimate probable losses for exposures thathave been specifically identified for impairment analysis bythe Firm and determined to be impaired. When a loan isspecifically identified for impairment, the impairment ismeasured based on the present value of expected future cashflows discounted at the loan\u2019s effective interest rate or theobservable market price of the loan or the fair value of thecollateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is collat-eral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to beprovided solely by the sale or operation of the underlyingcollateral. If the present value of the expected future cashflows (or alternatively, the observable market price of theloan or the fair value of the collateral) is less than therecorded investment in the loan, then the Firm recognizes anallowance and a charge to the provision for loan losses withinOther revenues.\nThe inherent allowance component of the allowance for loan\nlosses represents an estimate of the probable losses inherentin the loan portfolio and includes loans that have not beenidentified as impaired. The Firm maintains methodologies byloan product for calculating an allowance for loan losses thatestimates the inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Generally,inherent losses in the portfolio for non-impaired loans areestimated using statistical analysis and judgment regardingthe exposure at default, the probability of default and the lossgiven default.\nQualitative and environmental factors such as economic and\nbusiness conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, andlending terms and volume and severity of past due loans mayalso be considered in the calculations. The allowance for loanlosses is maintained at a level to ensure that it is reasonablylikely to adequately absorb the estimated probable lossesinherent in the portfolio. When the Firm recognizes an allow-ance, there is also a charge to the provision for loan losseswithin Other revenues.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings. The Firm may modify the\nterms of certain loans for economic or legal reasons related toa borrower\u2019s financial difficulties by granting one or moreconcessions that the Firm would not otherwise consider. Suchmodifications are accounted for and reported as a TDR.

TDRs arealso generally classified as nonaccrual and may be returned toaccrual status only after considering the borrower\u2019s sustainedrepayment performance for a reasonable period.\nNonaccrual Loans. The Firm places loans on nonaccrual\nstatus if principal or interest is past due for a period of 90days or more or payment of principal or interest is in doubtunless the obligation is well-secured and in the process ofcollection. A loan is considered past due when a payment dueaccording to the contractual terms of the loan agreement hasnot been remitted by the borrower. Substandard loans, ifidentified as impaired, are categorized as nonaccrual, as areloans classified as Doubtful or Loss.\nPayments received on nonaccrual loans held for investment\nare applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ulti-mate collectibility of principal. If collection of the principalof nonaccrual loans held for investment is not in doubt,interest income is realized on a cash basis. If neither principalnor interest collection is in doubt, loans are placed on accrualstatus and interest income is recognized using the effectiveinterest method. Loans that are on nonaccrual status may notbe restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and/or interest has been brought current after a reasonable periodof performance, typically a minimum of six months.\nCharge-offs. The Firm charges off a loan in the period that\nit is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in theallowance for loan losses and the balance of the loan. Ingeneral, any portion of the recorded investment in a collateraldependent loan (including any capitalized accrued interest,net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized premium ordiscount) in excess of the fair value of the collateral that canbe identified as uncollectible, and is therefore deemed aconfirmed loss, is charged off against the allowance for loanlosses. In addition, for loan transfers from loans held forinvestment to loans held for sale, at the time of transfer anyreduction in the loan value is reflected as a charge-off of therecorded investment, resulting in a new cost basis.\nLending Commitments. The Firm records the liability and\nrelated expense for the credit exposure related to commit-ments to fund loans that will be held for investment in amanner similar to outstanding loans discussed above. Theanalysis also incorporates a credit conversion factor, which isthe expected utilization of the undrawn commitment. Theliability is recorded in Other liabilities and accrued expensesin the balance sheets, and the expense is recorded in Othernon-interest expenses in the income statements. For moreinformation regarding loan commitments, standby letters ofcredit and financial guarantees, see Note 12.Loans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue, with valuation changes recorded in Other revenues.The Firm determines the valuation allowance on an indi-vidual loan basis, except for residential mortgage loans forwhich the valuation allowance is determined at the loanproduct level. Any decreases in fair value below the initialcarrying amount and any recoveries in fair value up to theinitial carrying amount are recorded in Other revenues.Increases in fair value above initial carrying value are notrecognized.\nInterest income on loans held for sale is accrued and recog-\nnized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origina-tion fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiumsare deferred as an adjustment to the loan\u2019s cost basis until therelated loan is sold, and as such, are included in the periodicdetermination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustmentsand the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.\nLending Commitments .

Depreciation and amortization are provided by thestraight-line method over the estimated useful life of theasset.Estimated Useful Lives of Assets\nin years Estimated Useful Life\nBuildings 39\nLeasehold improvements\u2014Building term of lease to 25Leasehold improvements\u2014Other term of lease to 15Furniture and fixtures 7Computer and communications equipment 3 to 9Power generation assets 15 to 29Terminals, pipelines and equipment 3 to 30Software costs 2 to 10\nPremises, equipment and software costs are tested for impair-\nment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggestthat an asset\u2019s carrying value may not be fully recoverable.\nGoodwill and Intangible AssetsThe Firm tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis\nand on an interim basis when certain events or circumstancesexist. The Firm tests goodwill for impairment at the reportingunit level, which is generally at the level of or one levelbelow its business segments. For both the annual and interimtests, the Firm has the option to either (i) perform aquantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative\nassessment to determine whether it is more likely than notthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carryingamount, in which case the quantitative test would beperformed.\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, the Firm\ncompares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carryingamount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reportingunit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairmentloss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fairvalue, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill allocated tothat reporting unit.\nThe estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived\nbased on valuation techniques the Firm believes marketparticipants would use for each respective reporting unit. Theestimated fair values are generally determined by utilizing adiscounted cash flow methodology or methodologies thatincorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples ofcertain comparable companies.\nIntangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful\nlives and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basiswhen impairment indicators are present. Impairment lossesare recorded within Other expenses in the income statements.\n97 December 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4699, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21019b41-2138-416f-befa-bc37a2cac837": {"__data__": {"id_": "21019b41-2138-416f-befa-bc37a2cac837", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f8a1c3a0-c6af-4c3c-b34f-81bc67eebf71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "225974a851b4fb1462affa9eb114e610b2706e8502b52d6f90344f65d35683a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ddaf8fd-52bf-4ad1-837e-cfd066842390", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e82c8ae47b8a646ccf3a4c254ec134e476868890651160159be926a12f2ff953", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc537be8-b1a5-4558-a83e-150f3a9fa7ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "12e9d9bc3f22e2a9cdccf9f2ff73da8d04a5723aef3eb0f04e14cd0c65e48ec2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "615a4c3f341029719b603e37e7a05d861f67bc6ea0f86984d07ba7d96b937917", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nEarnings per Common Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing earnings available to\nMorgan Stanley common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding for the period.Earnings available to Morgan Stanley common shareholdersrepresents net income applicable to Morgan Stanley reducedby preferred stock dividends. Common shares outstandinginclude common stock and vested RSUs where recipientshave satisfied either the explicit vesting terms or retirement-eligibility requirements. Diluted EPS reflects the assumedconversion of all dilutive securities.\nShare-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to\nvesting are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive)under the treasury stock method.\nThe Firm has granted PSUs that vest and convert to shares of\ncommon stock only if predetermined performance and marketgoals are satisfied. Since the issuance of the shares is contin-gent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the PSUs areincluded in diluted EPS based on the number of shares (ifany) that would be issuable if the end of the reporting periodwas the end of the contingency period.\nFor the calculation of basic and diluted EPS, see Note 16.Deferred CompensationStock-Based CompensationThe Firm measures compensation expense for stock-based\nawards at fair value. The Firm determines the fair value ofRSUs (including PSUs with non-market performance condi-tions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common stock,measured as the volume-weighted average price on the dateof grant. PSUs that contain market-based conditions arevalued using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\nCompensation expense is recognized over the relevant\nvesting period for each separately vesting portion of theaward. Compensation expense for awards with performanceconditions is recognized based on the probable outcome ofthe performance condition at each reporting date. Compensa-tion expense for awards with market-based conditions isrecognized irrespective of the probability of the marketcondition being achieved and is not reversed if the marketcondition is not met. The Firm accounts for forfeitures asthey occur.\nStock-based awards generally contain claw back and cancel-\nlation provisions. Certain awards provide the Firm discretionto claw back or cancel all or a portion of the award underspecified circumstances. Compensation expense for thoseawards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the Firm\u2019scommon stock or the relevant model valuation, as appro-\npriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration.\nEmployee Stock TrustsIn connection with certain stock-based compensation plans,\nthe Firm maintains and utilizes employee stock trusts at itsdiscretion. The assets of the employee stock trusts areconsolidated and are therefore accounted for in a mannersimilar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stockoutstanding are offset by an equal amount of common stockissued to employee stock trusts in the balance sheets.\nThe Firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based\ncompensation as the basis for recognition of the assets in theemployee stock trusts. Subsequent changes in the fair valueare not recognized as the Firm\u2019s stock-based compensationplans must be settled by delivery of a fixed number of sharesof the Firm\u2019s common stock.\nDeferred Cash-Based CompensationCompensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation\nplans is calculated based on the notional value of the awardgranted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the refer-enced investments that employees select. Compensationexpense is recognized over the relevant vesting period foreach separately vesting portion of the award. Compensationexpense for these awards is adjusted based on notional earn-ings of the referenced investments until distribution.\nThe Firm invests directly, as a principal, in investments or\nother financial instruments to economically hedge its obliga-tions under its deferred cash-based compensation plans.Changes in the value of such investments made by the Firmare recorded in Trading revenues and Investments revenues.Although changes in compensation expense resulting fromchanges in the fair value of the referenced investments willgenerally be offset by changes in the fair value of investmentsmade by the Firm, there is typically a timing differencebetween the immediate recognition of gains and losses on theFirm\u2019s investments and the deferred recognition of the relatedcompensation expense over the vesting period.\nRetirement-Eligible Employee CompensationFor year-end stock-based awards and deferred cash-based\ncompensation awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain afuture service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimatedcost of the awards over the course of the calendar yearpreceding the grant date, which reflects the period over whichthe compensation is earned.\nDecember 2018 Form 10-K 98", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4963, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc537be8-b1a5-4558-a83e-150f3a9fa7ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc537be8-b1a5-4558-a83e-150f3a9fa7ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5b5d2919-6600-4339-927d-02cde1143e44", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1f311a82a0296c7e4754ba2ebe20248b4aac8d51ef6be7512322af1e8ed22ab6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "21019b41-2138-416f-befa-bc37a2cac837", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "615a4c3f341029719b603e37e7a05d861f67bc6ea0f86984d07ba7d96b937917", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c5fbf33b-a0d8-4127-bdd5-85f1ef068a8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "94fb74092b2cf29a0a2e75651ecb1988c6a02f201cd20fbc46d69f7db473dfae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "12e9d9bc3f22e2a9cdccf9f2ff73da8d04a5723aef3eb0f04e14cd0c65e48ec2", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the\ntemporary differences between the financial statement andincome tax bases of assets and liabilities using currentlyenacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differ-ences are expected to reverse.

If adeferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuationallowance is established.

Thesestranded tax effects resulted from the requirement to reflectthe total amount of the remeasurement of and other adjust-ments to deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017 in incomefrom continuing operations, regardless of whether thedeferred taxes were originally recorded in AOCI. Accord-ingly, as of January 1, 2018, the Firm recorded a net increaseto Retained earnings as a result of the reclassification of$443 million of such stranded tax effects previously recordedin AOCI, which were primarily the result of the remeasure-ment of deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with thechange in tax rates.\nAside from the above treatment related to the Tax Act, the\nFirm releases stranded tax effects from AOCI into earningsonce the related category of instruments or transactionsgiving rise to these effects no longer exists.

Valuation using comparable instruments can bedone by calculating an implied yield (or spread over aliquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond orloan, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a valuefor the bond or loan. The adjustment to yield (or spread)should account for relevant differences in the bonds orloans such as maturity or credit quality. Alternatively, aprice-to-price basis can be assumed between the compa-rable instrument and the bond or loan being valued in orderto establish the value of the bond or loan.\n\u0081 Comparable equity price: A price derived from equity raises,\nshare buybacks and external bid levels, etc. A discount orpremium may be included in the fair value estimate.\n\u0081 Contingency probability: Probability associated with the\nrealization of an underlying event upon which the value ofan asset is contingent.\n\u0081 EBITDA multiple / Exit multiple: The ratio of Enterprise\nValue to EBITDA, where Enterprise Value is the aggregatevalue of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents.The EBITDA multiple reflects the value of the company interms of its full-year EBITDA, whereas the exit multiplereflects the value of the company in terms of its full-yearexpected EBITDA at exit. Either multiple allows comparisonbetween companies from an operational perspective as the\neffect of capital structure, taxation and depreciation/amortization is excluded.\n\u0081 Recovery rate: Amount expressed as a percentage of par\nthat is expected to be received when a credit event occurs.\nAn increase (decrease) to the following inputs would gener-\nally result in a lower (higher) fair value.\n\u0081 Cash-synthetic basis: The measure of the price differential\nbetween cash financial instruments and their syntheticderivative-based equivalents. The range disclosed in thetable above signifies the number of points by which thesynthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quotedprice of the underlying cash bonds.\n\u0081 Credit spread: The credit spread reflects the additional net\nyield an investor can earn from a security with more creditrisk relative to one with less credit risk. The credit spreadof a particular security is often quoted in relation to theyield on a credit risk-free benchmark security or referencerate, typically either U.S. Treasury or LIBOR.\n\u0081 Funding spread: The cost of borrowing defined as the\nincremental spread over the OIS rate for a specific collat-eral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specifictype of security pledged as collateral).\n\u0081 WACC: WACC theoretically represents the required rate of\nreturn to debt and equity investors. The WACC implied bythe current value of equity in a discounted cash flowmodel. The model assumes that the cash flow assumptions,including projections, are fully reflected in the currentequity value, while the debt to equity ratio is held constant.\nAn increase (decrease) to the following inputs would\ngenerally result in an impact to the fair value, but themagnitude and direction of the impact would depend onwhether the Firm is long or short the exposure.\n\u0081 Correlation: A pricing input where the payoff is driven\nby more than one underlying risk.

Aggregate marketrisk limits have been established for credit derivatives, andmarket risk measures are routinely monitored against theselimits. The Firm may also recover amounts on the underlyingreference obligation delivered to the Firm under CDS wherecredit protection was sold.\nSingle-Name CDS . A CDS protects the buyer against the\nloss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by theissuer. The protection buyer pays a periodic premium (gener-\nally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected forthe period. The Firm, in turn, performs under a CDS if acredit event as defined under the contract occurs. Typicalcredit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency ofthe referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of theobligations of the referenced entity.\nIndex and Basket CDS . Index and basket CDS are products\nwhere credit protection is provided on a portfolio of singlename CDS. Generally, in the event of a default on one of theunderlying names, the Firm pays a pro rata portion of thetotal notional amount of the CDS.\nThe Firm also enters into tranched index and basket CDS\nwhere credit protection is provided on a particular portion ofthe portfolio loss distribution. The most junior tranches coverinitial defaults, and once losses exceed the notional of thetranche, they are passed on to the next most senior tranche inthe capital structure.\nOther Credit Contracts . The Firm has invested in CLNs and\nCDOs, which are hybrid instruments containing embeddedderivatives, in which credit protection has been sold to theissuer of the note. If there is a credit event of a referenceentity underlying the instrument, the principal balance of thenote may not be repaid in full to the Firm.\nDecember 2018 Form 10-K 116", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3581, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5168d216-609c-47c1-8167-4d3b35ccf654": {"__data__": {"id_": "5168d216-609c-47c1-8167-4d3b35ccf654", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "834cfbe9-42ff-4937-81be-b146c5c2a909", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5ab40ba652aee6fcf60e4228b061ecc202f2bfcf8bed8fb42f1a91b570a76085", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d23d8f49-393e-43f1-87ce-534d2452f02c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "fd6b37df7eeaf8eabdb6d2059539dd63bbf01959bde4dfdac2ef1253ef5ef30f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "84e85e1c-b793-483e-9f43-f3b36bbd6946", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "78057ff031c503a3e30e64faed10f5395103bc22f99713d8488dbe684abe1bdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8ebdd512ce921e5dc6f322114530256f8b763ecc8eb6986774d15b9a64f27edc", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n5.

In certain cases, the Firm may be permitted topost collateral to a third-party custodian under a tri-partyarrangement that enables the Firm to take control of suchcollateral in the event of a counterparty default.\nThe Firm also monitors the fair value of the underlying secu-\nrities as compared with the related receivable or payable,including accrued interest, and, as necessary, requests addi-tional collateral, as provided under the applicable agreementto ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized, orthe return of excess collateral.\nThe risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral\npledged or received is managed by setting appropriatemarket-based haircuts. Increases in collateral margin calls onsecured financing due to market value declines may be miti-gated by increases in collateral margin calls on securitiespurchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowedtransactions with similar quality collateral. Additionally, theFirm may request lower quality collateral pledged be replacedwith higher quality collateral through collateral substitutionrights in the underlying agreements.\nThe Firm actively manages its secured financings in a manner\nthat reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured financingsof less liquid assets. The Firm considers the quality of collat-eral when negotiating collateral eligibility with counterparties,as defined by its fundability criteria. The Firm utilizes shorterterm secured financing for highly liquid assets and has estab-lished longer tenor limits for less liquid assets, for whichfunding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption.Offsetting of Certain Collateralized Transactions\nAt December 31, 2018\n$ in millionsGross\nAmountsAmounts\nOffsetNet\nAmounts\nPresentedAmounts\nNot Offset1Net\nAmounts\nAssetsSecurities purchased\nunder agreementsto resell $ 262,976 $ (164,454) $ 98,522 $ (95,610) $ 2,912\nSecurities borrowed 134,711 (18,398) 116,313 (112,551) 3,762\nLiabilitiesSecurities sold under\nagreements torepurchase $ 214,213 $ (164,454) $ 49,759 $ (41,095) $ 8,664\nSecurities loaned 30,306 (18,398) 11,908 (11,677) 231\nNet amounts for which master netting agreements are not in place or may\nnot be legally enforceable\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell $ 2,579\nSecurities borrowed 724\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase 6,762\nSecurities loaned 191\nAt December 31, 2017\n$ in millionsGross\nAmountsAmounts\nOffsetNet\nAmounts\nPresentedAmounts\nNot Offset1Net\nAmounts\nAssetsSecurities purchased\nunder agreementsto resell $ 199,044 $ (114,786) $ 84,258 $ (78,009) $ 6,249\nSecurities borrowed 133,431 (9,421) 124,010 (119,358) 4,652LiabilitiesSecurities sold under\nagreements torepurchase $ 171,210 $ (114,786) $ 56,424 $ (48,067) $ 8,357\nSecurities loaned 23,014 (9,422) 13,592 (13,271) 321Net amounts for which master netting agreements are not in place or may\nnot be legally enforceable\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell $ 5,687\nSecurities borrowed 572Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 6,945Securities loaned 307\n1.

Receivables under margin lending arrangements areincluded within Customer and other receivables in thebalance sheets. Under these agreements and transactions, theFirm receives collateral, including U.S. government andagency securities, other sovereign government obligations,corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. Customerreceivables generated from margin lending activities arecollateralized by customer-owned securities held by the Firm.The Firm monitors required margin levels and establishedcredit terms daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requirescustomers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions,when necessary.\nMargin loans are extended on a demand basis and generally\nare not committed facilities. Factors considered in the reviewof margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intendedpurpose, the degree of leverage being employed in theaccount, and an overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensureproper diversification or, in the case of concentrated posi-tions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral orpotential hedging strategies to reduce risk. Underlying collat-eral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidityof the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities,historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation ofindustry concentrations. For these transactions, adherence tothe Firm\u2019s collateral policies significantly limits its creditexposure in the event of a customer default. The Firm mayrequest additional margin collateral from customers, if appro-priate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have notbeen paid for or purchase securities sold but not deliveredfrom customers.Other Secured Financings\nOther secured financings include the liabilities related to\ntransfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financ-ings rather than sales, consolidated VIEs where the Firm isdeemed to be the primary beneficiary, and certain ELNs andother secured borrowings. These liabilities are generallypayable from the cash flows of the related assets, which areaccounted for as Trading assets (see Notes 11 and 13).\n7. Loans, Lending Commitments and Allowance\nfor Credit Losses\nLoans\nThe Firm\u2019s loan portfolio consists of the following types of\nloans:\n\u0081Corporate . Corporate loans primarily include commercial\nand industrial lending used for general corporate purposes,working capital and liquidity, event-driven loans and asset-backed lending products. Event-driven loans support clientmerger, acquisition, recapitalization or project financeactivities. Corporate loans are structured as revolving linesof credit, letter of credit facilities, term loans and bridgeloans. Risk factors considered in determining the allowancefor corporate loans include the borrower\u2019s financialstrength, industry, facility structure, collateral, and cove-nants along with other qualitative factors.\n\u0081Consumer . Consumer loans include unsecured loans and\nsecurities-based lending, which allows clients to borrowmoney against the value of qualifying securities for anysuitable purpose other than purchasing, trading, or carryingsecurities or refinancing margin debt. The majority ofconsumer loans are structured as revolving lines of creditand letter of credit facilities and are primarily offeredthrough the Firm\u2019s Liquidity Access Line program. Theallowance methodology for unsecured loans considers thespecific attributes of the loan, as well as the borrower\u2019ssource of repayment. The allowance methodology for secu-rities-based lending considers the collateral type underlyingthe loan ( e.g., diversified securities, concentrated securities\nor restricted stock).\n\u0081Residential Real Estate . Residential real estate loans\nmainly include non-conforming loans and HELOC. Theallowance methodology for non-conforming residentialmortgage loans considers several factors, including, but notlimited to, loan-to-value ratio, FICO score, home priceindex and delinquency status. The methodology forHELOC considers credit limits and utilization rates in addi-tion to the factors considered for non-conforming residen-tial mortgages.\nDecember 2018 Form 10-K 122", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5151, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51173fac-655f-45f1-ba22-4138aba16980": {"__data__": {"id_": "51173fac-655f-45f1-ba22-4138aba16980", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "968cc701-b94f-4114-a747-bb9c6ca95363", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "13876dad09af56cf76e9da1839ce468ce991fbf17c4680bc4d92908342527b06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "88b34c2b-db7c-47d8-9392-ff57b3f15b26", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6d9306c30f44c5d8165aae35bbeeeab6a95e834e5302d9f2120900cd1fcffdc9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f8dbf4af-7502-455c-9c71-bb4caea61960", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "82c1c97822b07d49a7eb9c9e3588f02f062e230c0550cdd7d7a796be92155c99", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f53cbb89fdf58fee8a8a36191fb0270537d0e274fced531126402017639a064f", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\u0081Wholesale Real Estate .

For corporate loans, creditevaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial state-ments, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, assetcomposition and quality, market capitalization and access tocapital markets, cash flow projections and debt service require-ments, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable.\nCRM also evaluates strategy, market position, industry\ndynamics, obligor\u2019s management and other factors that couldaffect an obligor\u2019s risk profile. For wholesale real estateloans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and trans-action metrics, including property type, loan-to-value ratio,occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalizationrates and market dynamics. For residential real estate and\nconsumer loans, the initial credit evaluation typicallyincludes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor\u2019s income,net worth, liquidity, collateral, loan-to-value ratio and creditbureau information. Subsequent credit monitoring for resi-dential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level.Consumer loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoingbasis.\nThe Firm utilizes the following credit quality indicators,\nwhich are consistent with U.S. banking agencies\u2019 definitionsof criticized exposures, as applicable, in its credit monitoringprocess for loans held for investment:\n\u0081Pass. A credit exposure rated pass has a continued expec-\ntation of timely repayment, all obligations of the borrowerare current, and the obligor complies with material termsand conditions of the lending agreement.\n\u0081Special Mention . Extensions of credit that have potential\nweakness that deserve management\u2019s close attention and, ifleft uncorrected, may, at some future date, result in the dete-rioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position.\n\u0081Substandard . Obligor has a well-defined weakness that\njeopardizes the repayment of the debt and has a high proba-bility of payment default with the distinct possibility thatthe Firm will sustain some loss if noted deficiencies are notcorrected.\n\u0081Doubtful . Inherent weakness in the exposure makes the\ncollection or repayment in full, based on existing facts,conditions and circumstances, highly improbable, and theamount of loss is uncertain.\n\u0081Loss. Extensions of credit classified as loss are consid-\nered uncollectible and are charged off.\nLoans considered as Doubtful or Loss are considered\nimpaired. Substandard loans are regularly reviewed forimpairment.

The Firm\nis a member of various U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges andclearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or deriva-tive contracts. Associated with its membership, the Firmmay be required to pay a certain amount as determined bythe exchange or the clearinghouse in case of a default ofany of its members or pay a proportionate share of thefinancial obligations of another member that may defaulton its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse.While the rules governing different exchange or clearing-house memberships and the forms of these guarantees mayvary, in general the Firm\u2019s obligations under these ruleswould arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse hadpreviously exhausted its resources.\nIn addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to\nassume a proportionate share of losses resulting from theclearinghouse\u2019s investment of guarantee fund contributionsand initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the defaultof a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specifiedresources allocated for such purpose by the clearinghouse.\nThe maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be\nestimated.

The Firm believes the likelihood ofany payment by the Firm under these arrangements isremote given the level of its due diligence in its role asinvestment banking advisor.In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Firm guar-\nantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (includingobligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchangecontracts and the settlement of physical commodities) ofcertain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity orproduct specific and are required by investors or tradingcounterparties.

This determination is based upon an analysis of thedesign of the VIE, including the VIE\u2019s structure and activ-ities, the power to make significant economic decisions heldby the Firm and by other parties, and the variable interestsowned by the Firm and other parties.\nThe power to make the most significant economic decisions\nmay take a number of different forms in different types ofVIEs. The Firm considers servicing or collateral managementdecisions as representing the power to make the most signifi-cant economic decisions in transactions such as securitiza-tions or CDOs. As a result, the Firm does not consolidatesecuritizations or CDOs for which it does not act as theservicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain otherrights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or torequire the liquidation of the entity. If the Firm serves asservicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rightsdescribed in the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes theinterests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates only thoseVIEs for which it holds a potentially significant interest in theVIE.\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions,\nCLNs and other asset-repackaged notes, there are no signifi-cant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In thesecases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior tothe initial closing of the transaction and at the termination ofthe transaction. The Firm concluded in most of these transac-tions that decisions made prior to the initial closing wereshared between the Firm and the initial investors based uponthe nature of the assets, including whether the assets wereissued in a transaction sponsored by the Firm and the extentof the information available to the Firm and to investors, thenumber, nature and involvement of investors, other rightsheld by the Firm and investors, the standardization of thelegal documentation and the level of continuing involvementby the Firm, including the amount and type of interestsowned by the Firm and by other investors. The Firm focusedits control decision on any right held by the Firm or investorsrelated to the termination of the VIE. Most re-securitizationtransactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaged notes have nosuch termination rights.Consolidated VIEs\nAssets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\nAt December 31, 2018 At December 31, 2017\n$ in millions VIE Assets VIE Liabilities VIE Assets VIE Liabilities\nOSF $ 267 $ \u2014 $ 378 $ 3\nMABS1 59 38 249 210\nOther2 809 48 1,174 250\nTotal $ 1,135 $ 86 $ 1,801 $ 463\nOSF\u2014Other structured financings\n1.

See Note 4for further information on derivative instruments and hedgingactivities.\nAvailable-for-Sale SecuritiesThe Firm holds AFS issued by VIEs not sponsored by the\nFirm within the Investment securities portfolio. These securi-ties are composed of those related to transactions sponsoredby the federal mortgage agencies and the most senior securi-ties issued by VIEs backed by student loans, automobileloans, commercial mortgage loans or CLOs.

See Note 5 for further information on the InvestmentSecurities Portfolio.\nMunicipal Tender Option Bond TrustsIn a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client\ntransfers a municipal bond to a trust. The trust issues short-term securities that the Firm, as the remarketing agent, sellsto investors. The client generally retains a residual interest.The short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facilitypursuant to which the investors may put their short-terminterests. In some programs, the Firm provides this liquidityfacility; in most programs, a third-party provider will providesuch liquidity facility.\nThe Firm may, in lieu of purchasing short term securities for\nremarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust.The client can generally terminate the transaction at any time.The liquidity provider can generally terminate the transactionupon the occurrence of certain events. When the transactionis terminated, the municipal bond is generally sold orreturned to the client. Any losses suffered by the liquidityprovider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility ofthe client. This obligation is generally collateralized.Liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bondtrusts are classified as derivatives. The Firm consolidates anymunicipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds theresidual interest.Credit Protection Purchased through Credit-Linked Notes\nCLN transactions are designed to provide investors with\nexposure to certain credit risk on referenced asset. In thesetransactions, the Firm transfers assets (generally high-qualitysecurities or money market investments) to an SPE, entersinto a derivative transaction in which the SPE sells protectionon an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through acredit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the SPE toinvestors. In some transactions, the Firm may also enter intointerest rate or currency swaps with the SPE.\nUpon the occurrence of a credit event related to the refer-\nenced asset, the SPE will deliver securities collateral aspayment to the Firm, which exposes the Firm to changes inthe collateral\u2019s value. Depending on the structure, the assetsand liabilities of the SPE may be recognized in the Firm\u2019sbalance sheets or accounted for as a sale of assets and theSPE is not consolidated.\nDerivative payments by the SPE are collateralized. The risks\nassociated with these and similar derivatives with SPEs areessentially the same as those with non-SPE counterparties,and are managed as part of the Firm\u2019s overall exposure.\nOther Structured FinancingsThe Firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop\nand own low-income communities (including low-incomehousing projects) and entities that construct and own facilitiesthat will generate energy from renewable resources. Theinterests entitle the Firm to a share of tax credits and taxlosses generated by these projects. In addition, the Firm hasissued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housingfunds. The guarantees are designed to return an investor\u2019scontribution to a fund and the investor\u2019s share of tax lossesand tax credits expected to be generated by the fund.

Regulatory Requirements\nRegulatory Capital Framework\nThe Firm is an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of\n1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and over-sight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System(\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). The Federal Reserve establishes capitalrequirements for the Firm, including well-capitalized stan-dards, and evaluates the Firm\u2019s compliance with such capitalrequirements. The OCC establishes similar capital require-ments and standards for MSBNA and MSPBNA (collectively,the \u201cU.S. Bank Subsidiaries\u201d). The regulatory capital require-ments are largely based on the Basel III capital standardsestablished by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisionand also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank WallStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\nRegulatory Capital RequirementsThe Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and\nleverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital require-ments. A summary of the calculations of regulatory capital,RWA and transition provisions follows.\nMinimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Totalcapital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Certain adjustments toand deductions from capital are required for purposes ofdetermining these ratios, such as goodwill, intangible assets,certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in AOCI andinvestments in the capital instruments of unconsolidatedfinancial institutions.\nIn addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio require-\nments, the Firm is subject to the following buffers in 2019:\n\u0081 A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conser-\nvation buffer;\u0081 The Common Equity Tier 1 G-SIB capital surcharge,\ncurrently at 3%; and\n\u0081 Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 CCyB, currently set\nby U.S. banking agencies at zero.\nIn 2018 and 2017, each of the buffers was 75% and 50%,\nrespectively, of the fully phased-in 2019 requirement notedabove.

The U.S. Qualified Plan uses acombination of active and risk-controlled fixed incomeinvestment strategies. The fixed income asset allocationconsists primarily of fixed income securities and relatedderivative instruments designed to approximate the expectedcash flows of the plan\u2019s liabilities in order to help reduce planexposure to interest rate variation and to better align assetswith the obligation. The longer-duration fixed income alloca-tion is expected to help protect the plan\u2019s funded status andmaintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run.The investment portfolio performance is assessed bycomparing actual investment performance with changes in theestimated present value of the U.S. Qualified Plan\u2019s benefitobligation.\nDerivative instruments are permitted in the U.S. Qualified\nPlan\u2019s investment portfolio only to the extent that theycomply with all of the plan\u2019s investment policy guidelinesand are consistent with the plan\u2019s risk and return objectives.\nAs a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the\nunderlying assets apply to a respective derivative product.This includes percentage allocations and credit quality.Derivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancinginvestment in the underlying assets and not to circumventportfolio restrictions.\nPlan assets are measured at fair value using valuation tech-\nniques that are consistent with the valuation techniquesapplied to the Firm\u2019s major categories of assets and liabilitiesas described in Notes 2 and 3. OTC derivative contractsconsist of investments in interest rate swaps.\nOther investments consist of pledged insurance annuity\ncontracts held by non-U.S.-based plans. The pledged insur-ance annuity contracts are valued based on the premiumreserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer hasgiven to the employee benefit plan that approximates fairvalue. The pledged insurance annuity contracts are catego-rized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nDecember 2018 Form 10-K 148", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3890, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f4e8aa3-70c0-4708-84c9-7a5f35029e4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f4e8aa3-70c0-4708-84c9-7a5f35029e4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6fede24b-8601-4a7c-814b-b79372eb6803", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5296a1b6b703b4c90ebd4ad48a06b2856bf95d660f2826d0a0a8471b5f1efebc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca6065b7-dcd2-427f-b18a-6c780349373e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "057fae87a9e479facde18a1e9941da4c0e3755db3340ed7697438e4fe1d78492", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30c76539-9d19-4ed4-b20e-3353518d3002", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca5db0d6eea1ccd0722f22be69bf1bf0e25375a2b293e4a905b541d8f87e1d55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0f118ee4c911047e5d740319f82d44e71ee594887648653ff118ea648f551061", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCommingled trust funds are privately offered funds that are\nregulated, supervised and subject to periodic examination by aU.S. federal or state agency and available to institutionalclients.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance\nrelated to Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which among other\nthings, requires a gross presentation of certain costs that were previ-ously netted against net revenues. Prior periods have not been restatedpursuant to this guidance. For further information on the full impact ofadoption of this new accounting guidance, see the following table andNote 21.\n2. The fourth quarter of 2018 included net intermittent discrete tax benefits\nof $111 million, primarily associated with the remeasurement of reservesand related interest due to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax exami-nations. The fourth quarter of 2017 included net intermittent discrete taxbenefits of $168 million, primarily related to the remeasurement ofreserves and related interest due to new information regarding thestatus of multi-year IRS tax examinations. The fourth quarter of 2017also included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of approximately$1.2 billion, primarily related to the remeasurement of certain netdeferred tax assets using the lower corporate tax rate as a result of theenactment of the Tax Act. Income tax consequences arising fromconversion of employee share-based awards are excluded from inter-mittent net discrete tax provisions (benefits), as we anticipate conver-sion activity each year (see Notes 2 and 20).\n3. Total non-interest revenues includes impairments of the Investment\nManagement business segment\u2019s interest in a third-party asset managerof $46 million in 2018 and $53 million in 2017.\n4. The sum of the quarters\u2019 earnings per common share may not equal the\nannual amounts due to the averaging effect of the number of shares andshare equivalents throughout the year.\nDecember 2018 Form 10-K 158", "start_char_idx": 2307, "end_char_idx": 4580, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0946834-bdec-46e1-8c7c-ccd08deb1d56": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0946834-bdec-46e1-8c7c-ccd08deb1d56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "164", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "060cd357-ba75-43fe-a018-ce782ee3f1df", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "164", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "27c7476c8d990a32eab99b7c9ddc49ba67eeed687f6a680bd5f0855a86ae9db7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "104ccef5-2ec4-4cce-bff2-3f092a47e534", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "91a92445aa03a51c3b0b843efa520b8a328b72c50ed51634e06e72a2c7929d81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc868193-6f7f-4077-b85f-593787a738c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "499b9902f6b428ce65ecfef27b27cb3579051ed980a5dae7432771da3f5df6d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f0bf96200de87afba6b36aba9e932e0ad5d530b0393f3a8260c89c083014667d", "text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nQuarterly Change in Revenue and Expense as a Result of\nApplication of the New Revenue Recognition Standard\n2018 Quarter\n$ in millions First Second Third Fourth\nNon-interest revenues\nGross presentation\nimpact1 $ 79 $ 108 $ 93 $ 70\nTiming impact 4 \u2014 (12) 38\nNon-interest expenses\nGross presentation\nimpact1 79 108 93 70\nNet change in revenue\nand expense $ 4 $ \u2014 $ (12) $ 38\n1.

The Firm\u2019s internal control over financial reportingis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of finan-cial statements for external purposes in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles in the United Statesof America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).The internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that:\n\u0081 Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions anddispositions of the assets of the Firm;\n\u0081 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statementsin accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts andexpenditures are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of the Firm\u2019s management and directors; and\n\u0081 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or dispo-sition of Firm assets that could have a material effect on theFirm\u2019s financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over\nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to futureperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inad-equate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree ofcompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness tofuture periods are subject to the risk that controls maybecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures maydeteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPNew York, New YorkFebruary 26, 2019\n167 December 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4000, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31013255-6378-464e-99c5-f92cf226ba8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "31013255-6378-464e-99c5-f92cf226ba8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "173", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af518993-b0b2-4e1c-ad27-dfc3bebc8399", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "173", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5be58e5c5689bb21a94e9b283925d945e1aa931cfd854247150475585c6eb307", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b6fda78-1094-4d17-b5f2-a7ec17a8a8d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "MS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4276104, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6a5b4b217eb0b2735646102ce666333652a769b849241f2c7a5a829331574cc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e25bde7-4478-4875-858b-1e7855a6f853", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30564e687cb1a1061c6b7af070bf1bda581d4e2f6ec33460e70190d8efc027a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "663418260df5e28371bbff77731a3fc0a604c1b7a2835d3dfb60163d1d7c3406", "text": "Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo change in the Firm\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f)) occurred during the quarter ended December 31,2018 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to mate-rially affect, the Firm\u2019s internal control over financialreporting.\nOther Information\nNone.\nUnresolved Staff Comments\nThe Firm, like other well-known seasoned issuers, from timeto time receives written comments from the staff of the SECregarding its periodic or current reports under the ExchangeAct.

Certain of the actual or threatened legalactions include claims for substantial compensatory and/orpunitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts ofdamages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise bethe primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are infinancial distress.\nThe Firm is also involved, from time to time, in other\nreviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal andinformal) by governmental and self-regulatory agenciesregarding the Firm\u2019s business, and involving, among othermatters, sales and trading activities, financial products orofferings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the Firm, andaccounting and operational matters, certain of which mayresult in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties,injunctions or other relief.\nThe Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as\nappropriate in each pending matter. Where available informa-tion indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurredat the date of the financial statements and the Firm canreasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm accruesthe estimated loss by a charge to income. The Firm\u2019s futurelegal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given thecurrent environment regarding government investigations andprivate litigation affecting global financial services firms,including the Firm.\nIn many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inher-\nently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable oreven possible, or to estimate the amount of any loss. TheFirm cannot predict with certainty if, how or when suchproceedings or investigations will be resolved or what theeventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, maybe, particularly for proceedings and investigations where thefactual record is being developed or contested or where plain-tiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminatedamages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerousissues may need to be resolved, including through potentiallylengthy discovery and determination of important factualmatters, determination of issues related to class certificationand the calculation of damages or other relief, and byaddressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to theproceedings or investigations in question, before a loss oradditional loss or range of loss or additional loss can bereasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation.Subject to the foregoing, the Firm believes, based on currentknowledge and after consultation with counsel, that theoutcome of such proceedings and investigations will not have\na material adverse effect on the financial condition of theFirm, although the outcome of such proceedings or investiga-tions could be material to the Firm\u2019s operating results andcash flows for a particular period depending on, among otherthings, the level of the Firm\u2019s revenues or income for suchperiod.\nWhile the Firm has identified below certain proceedings that\nthe Firm believes to be material, individually or collectively,there can be no assurance that additional material losses willnot be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted orare not yet determined to be material.\nResidential Mortgage and Credit Crisis Related MattersOn July 15, 2010, China Development Industrial Bank\n(\u201cCDIB\u201d) filed a complaint against the Firm, styled China\nDevelopment Industrial Bank v.
