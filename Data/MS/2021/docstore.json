Operating within the financial services industry on a global basis \npresents, among other things, technological, risk management, \nregulatory and other infrastructure challenges that require \neffective resource allocation in order for us to remain \ncompetitive. Our competitive position depends on a number \nof factors, including our reputation, the quality and \nconsistency of our long-term investment performance, \ninnovation, execution, relative pricing or other factors \nincluding entering into new, or expanding current, businesses \nas a result of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives. Our \nability to sustain or improve our competitive position also \ndepends substantially on our ability to continue to attract and \nretain highly qualified employees while managing \ncompensation and other costs. We compete with commercial \nbanks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, exchanges, \nelectronic trading and clearing platforms, financial data \nrepositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds, energy companies, financial technology \nfirms and other companies offering financial or ancillary \nservices in the U.S.  and globally, as well as digitally, \nincluding through the internet .

These laws are generally aimed at \ncodifying basic cybersecurity protections and mandating data \nbreach notification requiremen ts.\nOur businesses are also subject to increasing privacy and data \nprotection  legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain personal information. These \nrequirements impose mandatory privacy and data protection \nobligations, including providing for individual rights, \nenhanced governance and accountability requireme nts, and \nsignificant fines and litigation risk for noncompliance. In \naddition, several jurisdictions have enacted or proposed \npersonal data localization requirements and restrictions on \ncross-border transfer of personal data that may restrict our \nability to conduct business in those jurisdictions or create \nadditional financial and regulatory burdens to do so.\nMany aspects of our businesses are subject to legal \nrequirements concerning the use and protection of certain \ncustomer information , as well as the privacy and \ncybersecurity laws referenced above.

In addition, \nalthough we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to \npolicy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber \nand information security risks, such insurance coverage may \nbe insufficient to cover all losses.\nWe continue to make investments with a view toward \nmaintaining and enhancing our cybersecurity posture.

Liquidity risk \nalso encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our \nfinancial obligations without experiencing significant \nbusiness disruption or reputational damage that may threaten \nour viability as a going concern , as well as the associated \nfunding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress \nevents that may negatively affect our liquidity and may \nimpact our ability to raise new funding. For more information \non how we monitor and manage liquidity risk, see \n\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \nCondition and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital \nResources\u201d and \u201c Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures \nabout Risk\u2014Liquidity Risk .\u201d\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on \nexternal sources to finance a significant portion of our \noperations.\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be \nnegatively affected by our inability to raise funding in the \nlong-term or short-term debt capital markets, our inability to access the secured lending markets, or unanticipated outflows \nof cash or collateral by customers or clients. Factors that we \ncannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or \nnegative views about the financial services industry generally, \nincluding concerns regarding fiscal matters in the U.S. and \nother geographic areas, could impair our ability to raise \nfunding.\nIn addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if \ninvestors or lenders develop a negative perception of our \nlong-term or short-term financial prospects due to factors such \nas an incurrence of large trading losses, a downgrade by the \nrating agenci es, a d ecline in the level of our business activity, \nif regulatory authorities take significant action against us or \nour industry, or if we discover significant employee \nmisconduct or illegal activity.\nIf we are unable to raise funding using the methods described \nabove, we would likely need to finance or liquidate \nunencumbered assets, such as our investment portfolios or \ntrading assets, to meet maturing liabilities or other \nobligations.

An SPOE strategy generally \ncontemplates the provision of adequate capital and liquidity \nby the Parent Company to certain of its subsidiaries so that \nsuch subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement \nthe resolution strategy, and the Parent Company has entered \ninto a secured amended and restated support agreement with \nits material entities, as defined in our resolution plan, pursuant \nto which it would provide such capital and liquidity to such \nentities.\nIn further development of our SPOE strategy, a wholly \nowned, direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (\u201cFunding IHC\u201d), serves as a \nresolution funding vehicle. The Parent Company has \ntransferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, \ncertain assets to the Funding IHC.

For example, potential conflicts \ncan occur when there is a divergence of interests between us \nand a client, among clients, between an employee on the one \nhand and us or a client on the other, or situations in which we \nmay be a creditor of a client. Moreover, we utilize multiple \nbrands and business channels, including those resulting from \nour acquisitions, and continue to enhance the collaboration \nacross business segments, which may heighten the potential \nconflicts of interest  or the risk of improper sharing of \ninformation.\nWe have policies, procedures and controls that are designed to \nidentify and address potential conflicts of interest, and we \nutilize various measures, such as the use of disclosure, to \nmanage these potential conflicts. However, identifying and \nmitigating potential conflicts of interest can be complex and \nchallenging and can become the focus of media and \nregulatory scrutiny. Indeed, actions that merely appear to \ncreate a conflict can put our reputation at risk even if the \nlikelihood of an actual conflict has been mitigated. It is \npossible that potential conflicts could give rise to litigation or \nenforcement actions, which may lead to our clients being less \nwilling to enter into transactions in which a conflict may \noccur and could adversely affect our businesses and \nreputation.\nOur regulators have the ability to scrutinize our activities for \npotential conflicts of interest, including through detailed \nexaminations of specific transactions. For example, our status \nas a BHC supervised by the Federal Reserve subjects us to \ndirect Federal Reserve scrutiny with respect to transactions \nbetween our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and their affiliates. \nFurther, the Volcker Rule subjects us to regulatory scrutiny \nregarding certain transactions between us and our clients.\nRisk Management\nOur risk management strategies, models and processes may \nnot be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all \nmarket environments or against all types of risk, which \ncould result in unexpected losses.\nWe have devoted significant resources to develop our risk \nmanagement capabilities and expect to continue to do so in \nthe future. Nonetheless, our risk management strategies, \nmodels and processes, including our use of various risk \nmodels for assessing market exposures and hedging \nstrategies, stress testing and other analysis, may not be fully \neffective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market \nenvironments or against all types of risk, including risks that \nare unidentified or unanticipated.As our businesses change and grow, and the markets in which \nwe operate evolve, our risk management strategies, models \nand processes may not always adapt with those changes. \nSome of our methods of managing risk are based upon our \nuse of observed historical market behavior and management\u2019s \njudgment. As a result, these methods may not predict future \nrisk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the \nhistorical measures indicate.\nIn addition, many models we use are based on assumptions or \ninputs regarding correlations among prices of various asset \nclasses or other market indicators and, therefore , cannot \nanticipate sudden, unanticipated , or unidentified market or \neconomic movements, such as the impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic, which could cause us to incur losses.\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity, operational, model, \nlegal, regulatory and compliance risks requires, among other \nthings, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a \nlarge number of transactions and events, and these policies \nand procedures may not be fully effective. Our trading risk \nmanagement strategies and techniques also seek to balance \nour ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure \nto potential losses.\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of risk \nmonitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques \nand the judgments that accompany their application cannot \nanticipate every economic and financial outcome or the \ntiming of such outcomes.

firms \nand others, which could lead to pricing pressures that could \nmaterially adversely affect our revenue s and profitability.\nThe financial services industry and all aspects of our \nbusinesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to \nremain so. We compete with commercial banks, brokerage \nfirms, insurance companies, exchanges, electronic trading and \nclearing platforms, financial data repositories, sponsors of \nmutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds , energy \ncompanies, financial technology firms and other companies \noffering financial or ancillary services in the U.S. and \nglobally, as well as digitally, including through the internet. \nWe also compete with companies that provide online trading \nand banking services, investment advisor services, robo-\nadvice capabilities, access to digital asset capabilities and \nservices , and other financial products and services. We \ncompete on the basis of several factors, including transaction \nexecution, capital or access to capital, products and services, \ninnovation, technology, reputation, risk appetite and price.\nOver time, certain sectors of the financial services industry \nhave become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a \nbroad range of financial services have left businesses, been \nacquired by or merged into other firms, or have declared \nbankruptcy. Such changes could result in our remaining \ncompetitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such \nas the ability to offer a broader range of products and services \nand geographic diversity, or new competitors may emerge.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience pricing \npressures as a result of these factors and as some of our \ncompetitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices, \neliminating commissions or other fees, or providing more \nfavorable terms of business. In addition, certain of our \ncompetitors may be subject to different  and, in some cases, \nless stringent, legal and regulatory regimes  than we are, \nthereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage. Some new \ncompetitors in the financial technology sector have sought to \ntarget existing segments of our businesses that could be \nsusceptible to disruption by innovative or less regulated \nbusiness models. For more information regarding the \ncompetitive environment in which we operate, see \u201cBusiness\n\u2014Competition\u201d and \u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and \nRegulation.\u201d\nAutomated trading markets and the introduction and \napplication of new technologies may adversely affect our \nbusiness and may increase competition.\nWe continue to experience price competition in some of our \nbusinesses. In particular, the ability to execute securities, \nderivatives and other financial instrument trades electronically \non exchanges, swap execution facilities and other automated \ntrading platforms, and the introduction and application of new \ntechnologies will likely continue the pressure on revenues. \nThe trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets will likely continue as additional markets move to \nmore automated trading platforms.

Certain of these strategic initiatives, and integration \nthereof, may cause us to incur incremental expenses and may \nalso require incremental financial, management and other \nresources. \nFor example, the integrations of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance \ninvolve a number of risks, including failure to realize \nanticipated cost savings and difficulty integrating the \nbusinesses. It is possible that the remaining integration \nprocesses could also result in unanticipated disruptions of ongoing businesses, the loss of key employees, the loss of \nclients, or overall integrations that take longer than originally \nanticipated.\nIn the case of joint ventures, partnerships and minority stakes, \nwe are subject to additional risks and uncertainties because \nwe may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or \nreputational damage relating to systems, controls and \npersonnel that are not under our control. \nIn addition, conflicts or disagreements between us and any of \nour joint venture partners or partners may negatively impact \nthe benefits to be achieved by the relevant joint venture or \npartnership, respectively.\nThere is no assurance that any of our acquisitions, divestitures \nor investments will be successfully integrated or \ndisaggregated or yield all of the positive benefits and \nsynergies anticipated.

These \nrevenues are generally based on the net asset value of the \naccount in which a client is invested.\nWithin the Investment Management business segm ent, Asset \nmanagement revenues are primarily composed of fees \nreceived from  investment vehicles on the basis of assets under \nmanagement.

Although changes in \ncompensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value \nof the referenced investments will generally be offset by \nchanges in the fair value of investments made by the Firm, \nthere is typically a timing difference between the immediate \nrecognition of gains and losses on the Firm's investments and \nthe compensation expense recognized over the vesting period.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision for our business segments is \ngenerally determined based on the revenues, expenses and \nactivities directly attributable to each business segment. \nCertain items have been allocated to each business segment, \ngenerally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other \nrelevant measures.Table of Contents  \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n29 December 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2158, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba173d1b-b7d1-417d-9978-43b0366bb4ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba173d1b-b7d1-417d-9978-43b0366bb4ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df787c79-2028-4ba1-9350-e7abc962ebe2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a414ec1f9f342b5848c6fb5e997c04223a2610a8eb584d25e7b6c5e58c31ff86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b848524a-2b5e-4ec5-be6c-fcda14f297ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "96d86c0cf59afb1f6a3dd1cdb5ed04977ad4c8bdb535524f556fb65bd7a74972", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "16e2c219-d6b1-4e7d-804c-77863d4fd0f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b884b18f2951f24cb4ce82ad203a0d4e7b57e7395c6cd69034c9addb9baa792", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e5c42344ed5f5ee26af5304b820641eb920f23f1e9ff08f11840ed7de714580c", "text": "Institutional Securities\nIncome Statement Information\n    % Change\n$ in millions 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020\nRevenues\nAdvisory $ 3,487 $ 2,008 $ 2,116  74 %  (5) %\nEquity  4,437  3,092  1,708  43 %  81 %\nFixed income  2,348  2,104  1,910  12 %  10 %\nTotal Underwriting  6,785  5,196  3,618  31 %  44 %\nTotal Investment banking  10,272  7,204  5,734  43 %  26 %\nEquity1 11,435  9,921  8,133  15 %  22 %\nFixed income1 7,516  8,847  5,985  (15) %  48 %\nOther1 610  504  644  21 %  (22) %\nNet revenues1 29,833  26,476  20,496  13 %  29 %\nProvision for credit losses1 (7)  731  151  (101) % N/M\nCompensation and benefits  9,165  8,342  7,433  10 %  12 %\nNon-compensation expenses1 8,861  8,252  7,422  7 %  11 %\nTotal non-interest expenses1 18,026  16,594  14,855  9 %  12 %\nIncome before provision for \nincome taxes  11,814  9,151  5,490  29 %  67 %\nProvision for income taxes  2,746  2,040  769  35 %  165 %\nNet income  9,068  7,111  4,721  28 %  51 %\nNet income applicable to \nnoncontrolling interests  111  99  122  12 %  (19) %\nNet income applicable to \nMorgan Stanley $ 8,957 $ 7,012 $ 4,599  28 %  52 %\n1.Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current \npresentation.

The menu of \ninvestments, which is selected by the Firm, includes fixed \nincome, equity, commodity and money market funds.\nCompensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation \nawards is calculated based on the notional value of the award \ngranted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the \nreferenced investments that employees select. Compensation \nexpense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each \nseparately vesting portion of deferred awards.\nThe Firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial \ninstruments and other investments to economically hedge \ncertain of its obligations under these deferred cash-based \ncompensation plans. Changes in the value of such investments \nare recorded in Trading and Investments revenues. Although \nchanges in compensation expense resulting from changes in \nthe fair value of the referenced investments will generally be \noffset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the \nFirm, there is typically a timing difference between the \nimmediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm\u2019s \ninvestments and the deferred recognition of the related \ncompensation expense over the vesting period.

We believe that of \nour significant accounting policies  (see Note 2  to the financial \nstatements), the following policies involve a higher degree of \njudgment and complexity .\nFair Value\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\nA significant number of our financial instruments are carried \nat fair value. We make estimates regarding the valuation of \nassets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the \nfinancial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but \nare not limited to:\n\u2022Trading assets and Trading liabilities;\n\u2022Investment Securities\u2014AFS;\n\u2022Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;\n\u2022Certain Deposits, primarily certificates of deposit;\n\u2022Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;\n\u2022Certain Other secured financings; and\n\u2022Certain Borrowings.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell \nan asset or paid to transfer a liability ( i.e., the exit price) in an \norderly transaction between market participants at the \nmeasurement date.\nIn determining fair value, we use various valuation \napproaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair \nvalue that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs \nand minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by \nrequiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when \navailable. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, \nwherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, \nLevel 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in \nmarkets that are not active or for which all significant inputs \nare observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques \nthat incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, \ntherefore, require the greatest use of judgment. \nIn periods of market disruption, the observability of prices \nand inputs may be reduced for many instruments, which could \ncause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to \nLevel 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3.

Evaluating goodwill for impairment \nrequires management to make significant judgments , \nincluding, in part, the use of unobservable inputs that are \nsubject to uncertainty.  Goodwill impairment tests are \nperformed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the \nlevel of or one level below our business segments. Goodwill \nno longer retains its association with a particular acquisition \nonce it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the \nactivities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically \ndeveloped, are available to support the value of the goodwill.\nFor both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to \neither (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first \nperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is \nless than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative \ntest would be performed.\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare \nthe fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amou nt, \nincluding goodwill . If the fair value of the reporting unit is \nless than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is \nequal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, \nlimited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that \nreporting unit.\nThe estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived \nbased on valuation techniques we believe market participants \nwould use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair \nvalue is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash \nflow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable \ncompanies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, \neach of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that \nwas substantially in excess of its carrying value.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are initially recorded at cost, or in the \nsituation where acquired as part of a business combination, at \nthe fair value determined as part of the acquisition method of \naccou nting. Subsequently, amortizable intangible assets are \ncarried in the balance sheet at amortized cost, where \namortization is recognized over their estimated useful lives. \nIndefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are \ntested for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1  and on \nan interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist.On a quarterly basis : \n\u2022All intangible assets are assessed for the presence of \nimpairment indicators. Where such indicators are present, \nan evaluation for impairment  is conducted . \n\u2022For amortizable intangible assets, an impairment loss exists \nif the carrying amount of the i ntangible asset  is not \nrecoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amoun t \nof the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the \nsum of the expected undiscounted cash flows. \n\u2022For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment exists \nif the carrying a mount of the intangible asset  exceeds its \nfair value.  \n\u2022Amortizable intangible assets are assessed for any \nindication that the remaining useful life or the finite life  \nclassification should be revised. In such cases,  the \nremaining carrying amount is amortized prospectively over \nthe revised useful life , unless it is determined that the life of \nthe intangible asset is indefinite, in which case the \nintangible asset is not amortized .\n\u2022Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for any \nindication that the life of the intangible asset is no longer \nindefinite; in such cases, the carrying amount of the \nintangible asset is amortized  prospectively over its \nremaining useful life.\nThe initial valuation of an intangible asset as part of the \nacquisition method of accounting and the subsequent \nvaluation of intangible assets as part of  an impairment \nassessment are subjective and based, in part, on inputs that are \nunobservable and can be subject to uncertainty.  These inputs \ninclude, but are not limited to, forecasted cash flows, revenue \ngrowth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates.\nFor both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an \nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new \ncost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment \nlosses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the \nnew cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of \nthat asset.

These scenarios contain various \ncombinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of \ndifferent severity and duration. The methodology, \nimplementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity \nStress Tests are important components of the Required \nLiquidity Framework.\nThe assumptions used in our various Liquidity Stress Test \nscenarios include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022No government support;\n\u2022No access to equity and limited access to  unsecured debt \nmarkets;\n\u2022Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress \nhorizon;\n\u2022Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of \nsecured funding;\n\u2022Additional collateral that would be required by trading \ncounterparties, certain exchanges and clearing \norganizations related to credit rating downgrades;\n\u2022Additional collateral that would be required due to \ncollateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled \ncollateral;\n\u2022Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;\n\u2022Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third \nparties; and\n\u2022Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short \npositions that fund long positions.\nLiquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at \ndifferent levels, including major operating subsidiaries and \nmajor currencies, to capture specific cash requirements and \ncash availability across the Firm, including a limited number \nof asset sales in a stressed environment.

Framework\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio  and Net Stable Funding Ratio\nThe Firm, MSBNA, MSPBNA and ETB are required to \nmaintain a minimum LCR and NSFR of 100%. The LCR \nrequires that banking organizations have sufficient Eligible \nHQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant \nstress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term \nresilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking \norganizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR \npurposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, \nand certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. The NSFR \nrequires large banking organizations to maintain sufficiently \nstable sources of funding over a one-year time horizon.\nAs of December 31, 2021 , the Firm, MSBNA, MSPBNA and \nETB are compliant with the minimum LCR and NSFR \nrequirements of 100%.\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio\n Average Daily Balance\nThree Months Ended\n$ in millionsDecember 31, \n2021September 30, \n2021\nEligible HQLA1  \nCash deposits with central banks $ 54,606 $ 66,288 \nSecurities2 183,105  174,068 \nTotal Eligible HQLA1$ 237,711 $ 240,356 \nLCR  134 %  134 %\n1.Under the LCR rule, Eligible HQLA is calculated using weightings and excluding \ncertain HQLA held in subsidiaries.\n2.Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, \nsovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds.\nFunding Management\nWe manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of \ndisruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of \ndiversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by \nproduct, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the \ntenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding \nperiod of the assets being financed. Our goal is to achieve an \noptimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing.\nWe fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse \nsources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, \nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities \nlending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have \nactive financing programs for both standard and structured \nproducts targeting global investors and currencies.\nSecured Financing\nThe liquid nature of the marketable securities and short-term \nreceivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment \nprovides us with flexibility in managing the composition of \nour balance sheet . Secured financing investors principally \nfocus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. \nAccordingly, we actively manage our secured financings \nbased on the quality of the assets being funded.\nWe have established longer tenor secured funding \nrequirements for less liquid asset classes, for which funding \nmay be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define \nhighly liquid assets as government-issued or government-\nguaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and \nless liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. \nTo further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing \nfor less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits \nto diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of \nmonthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. \nFurthermore, we obtain term secured funding liabilities in \nexcess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to \nreplace maturing trades in the event that secured financing \nmarkets, or our ability to access them, become limited. As a \ncomponent of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, \nwe hold a portion of our Liquidity Resources against the \npotential disruption to our secured financing capabilities.\nWe generally maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable \nsecurities, which takes into account HQLA classifications \nconsistent with LCR definitions, and other regulatory \nrequirements, and provides a valuable future source of \nliquidity.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4171, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96a468b4-8069-40cf-9702-0b23d85bc170": {"__data__": {"id_": "96a468b4-8069-40cf-9702-0b23d85bc170", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dbbdf456-d8f1-4084-a751-30a4d9a47e1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "fac737366b92c7f23ef12091ee5da7b25a868ca8893b7e84ea997a983f9c5dc7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e5c8231-f47d-49de-b9ec-64b1c480e1c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "19dd1230fc4f0fedff1cca54eceb930c44fd27653c430a57266024500cd23eab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f9aa487-49b9-4d43-a78f-dc3fb244e413", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "193c0151a1e97bb43d3c251942f66d97d4037e3832a704ff829dd6f877f0ce9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6618c662ffc5228276a10eaa55c30b7bc120e0f4c8304b05053ce869b39d1d96", "text": "To further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing \nfor less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits \nto diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of \nmonthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. \nFurthermore, we obtain term secured funding liabilities in \nexcess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to \nreplace maturing trades in the event that secured financing \nmarkets, or our ability to access them, become limited.

In line with our \nSPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has \nagreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its \nwholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings \nLLC (the \u201cFunding IHC\u201d). In addition, the Parent Company \nhas entered into an amended and restated support agreement \nwith its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and \ncertain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution \nscenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to \ncontribute all of its Contributable Assets to our material \nentities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be \nobligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our \nmaterial entities. The combined implication of the SPOE \nresolution strategy and the requirement to maintain certain \nlevels of TLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed \non the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of \neligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any \nlosses are imposed on creditors of our material entities and \nwithout requiring taxpayer or government financial support .\nThe obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC \nunder the amended and restated support agreement are in \nmost cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the \nParent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the \nParent Company and certain other assets) and the assets of the \nFunding IHC. As a result, claims of our material entities, \nincluding the Funding IHC, with respect to the secured assets, \nare effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent \nCompany .Table of Contents  \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nDecember 2021 Form 10-K 50", "start_char_idx": 3421, "end_char_idx": 6257, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8662609a-ea19-48ef-9a9e-a9c0105a5e5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8662609a-ea19-48ef-9a9e-a9c0105a5e5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4d994fe-c72e-4bbd-a638-567b38c745ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3b7d3fc70baad178dc75b705b6eba582e954cc3fdbeb7824e42345394cdba139", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "19c5455d-e9de-4c58-bb38-104df9163fda", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6fadf804d15232b40759a7fef87012c4c06ec20ca39828152af92cd15a2c5f3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c1a3fe80-5d70-44c7-a495-03eb151108cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "baf932847d7b13028afad0120399d09006175e28949661abc168952b70e13486", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "974074be1521a3d232d64cdfe5818c5a8abde4c8f0ed7a85dc99fe822dbfa7fc", "text": "For more information about resolution and recovery planning \nrequirements and our activities in these areas, including the \nimplications of such activities in a resolution scenario,  see \n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u2014Financial Holding \nCompany\u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning\u201d and \u201cRisk \nFactors\u2014Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.\u201d\nRegulatory Developments and Other Matters\nReplacement of London Interbank Offered Rate  and \nReplacement or Reform of Other Interest Rate  Benchmarks\nCentral banks around the world, including the Federal \nReserve, have commissioned committees and working groups \nof market participants and official sector representatives to \nreplace LIBOR and replac e or reform other interest rate \nbenchmarks (collectively, the \u201cIBORs\u201d ). A transition away \nfrom use of the IBORs to alternative rates and other potential \ninterest rate benchmark reforms is underway and will \ncontinue over the course of the next few years.\nIn accordance with announcements by the Financial Conduct \nAuthority (\u201c FCA \u201d), which regulates LIBOR publication,  and \nICE Benchmark Administration  Limited , which administers \nLIBOR publication, the publication of most non-U.S. dollar \nLIBOR rates ceased as of the end of December 2021. While \npublication of the one-, three- and six- month  Sterling and \nJapanese yen LIBOR settings will continue at least until the \nend of 2022 on the basis of a \u201c synthetic \u201d methodology \n(known as \u201csynthetic LIBOR\u201d ), these rates have been \ndesignated unrepresentative by the FCA and are solely \navailable for use in legacy transactions. Furthermore, while \ncertain U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors are expected to continue to \nbe published until June 30, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies \nand the FCA have issued guidance instructing banks to cease \nentering into new contracts referencing  U.S. dollar LIBOR no \nlater than December 31, 2021, with certain exceptions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our LIBOR-referenced  contracts \nwere primarily concentrated in derivati ve contracts and to a \nlesser extent, loans, floating rate notes, preferred shares, \nsecuritizations and mortgages. A significant majority of our \nderivative contracts, and a majority of our non-derivative \ncontracts contain  fallback provisions or otherwise have an \nexpected path that will allow for the transition to an \nalternative reference rate upon the cessation of the applicable \nLIBOR rate.  \nWhile we have made substantial progress in the transition \naway from the IBORs, we nonetheless currently remain party \nto a significant number of U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked \ncontracts. A significant majority of our U.S. dollar deriv ative  \ncontracts contain IBOR fallback provisions based in the first \ninstance on SOFR  due to incorporation of the International \nSwaps and Derivatives Association (\u201c ISDA \u201d) Fallba cks \nSupplement or through amendment by adherence to the 2020 \nIBOR Fallbacks Protocol. Further, to the extent that a U.S. \ndollar LIBOR-linked deriva tive or non-derivative contract is \ngoverned by New York law, New York State has enacted legislation that is intended to minimize legal and economic \nuncertainty following U.S. dollar LIBOR\u2019s cessation by \nreplacing LIBOR references in certain contracts under certain \ncircumstances with a benchmark based on SOFR, including \nany spread adjustment, recommended by the Federal Reserve, \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Alternative \nReference Rates Committee.

We \nbelieve effective risk management is vital to the success of \nour business activities. Accordingly, we have an Enterprise \nRisk Management (\u201cERM\u201d) framework to integrate the \ndiverse roles of risk management into a holistic enterprise \nstructure and to facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment \ninto decision-making processes across the Firm.\nWe have policies and procedures in place to identify, \nmeasure, monitor, escalate, mitigate and control  the principal \nrisks involved in the activities of the Institutional Securities, \nWealth Management and Investment Management business \nsegments, as well as at the Parent Company level. The \nprincipal risks involved in our business activities include \nmarket (including non-trading risks), credit, operational, \nmodel, compliance, cybersecurity, liquidity, strategic, \nreputational and conduct risk. Strategic risk is integrated into \nour business planning, embedded in the evaluation of all \nprincipal risks and overseen by the Board.\nThe cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the \npursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk taking \nthat protects our capital base and franchise. This philosophy is \nimplemented through the ERM framework. Five key \nprinciples underlie this philosophy: integrity, \ncomprehensiveness, independence, accountability and \ntransparency. To help ensure the efficacy of risk management, \nwhich is an essential component of our reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication \nand the appropriate escalation of risk matters. The fast-paced, \ncomplex and constantly evolving nature of global financial \nmarkets requires us to maintain a risk management culture \nthat is incisive, knowledgeable about specialized products and \nmarkets, and subject to ongoing review and enhancement.\nOur risk appetite defines the aggregate level and types of risk  \nthat the Firm is willing to accept to achieve its business \nobjectives, taking into account the interests of clients and \nfiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and other \nregulatory requirements. This risk appetite is embedded in our \nrisk culture and linked to our short-term and long-term \nstrategic, capital and financial plans, as well as compensation \nprograms.

These results are \nincorporated into identified employees\u2019 performance reviews \nand compensation and promotion decisions.\nThe Firm\u2019s clawback and cancellation provisions apply to \ndeferred incentive compensation and cover a broad scope of \nemployee conduct, including any act or omission (including \nwith respect to direct supervisory responsibilities) that \nconstitutes a breach of obligation to the Firm or causes a \nrestatement of the Firm\u2019s financial results, constitutes a \nviolation of the Firm\u2019s global risk management principles, \npolicies and standards, or causes a loss of revenue associated \nwith a position on which the employee was paid and the \nemployee operated outside of risk management policies.Table of Contents  \nRisk Disclosures\nDecember 2021 Form 10-K 54", "start_char_idx": 4200, "end_char_idx": 6012, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09843550-fcd8-441b-b588-0f7716884a0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "09843550-fcd8-441b-b588-0f7716884a0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b38de51-e5b3-4cee-b5d9-0b597c507ddc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "383e20fd205e3a34b5dc2a002bf61a874709c4493fe339a6dffdc3184d63e5d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6168ee7c-73bb-4d0a-93bd-9cb19d7350bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1deccfd997152350e268105376f664c999f5df561ae99d4537ce4281d116a5d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4227a439-2a88-4eff-8744-8b9dea617b76", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4e77328eccea3f288a4d3a35822791b4e01e378212139ee10936e18f5817b0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1e8e277717c65d91939fda7cef9092c01aaeb8e482accfc895821eb3f04d891e", "text": "Risk Limits Framework\nRisk limits and quantitative metrics provide the basis for \nmonitoring ri sk-taking activity and avoiding outsized risk \ntaking. Our risk-taking capacity is sized through the Firm\u2019s \ncapital planning process where losses are estimated under the \nFirm\u2019s BHC Severely Adverse stress testing scenario. We \nalso maintain a comprehensive suite of risk limits and \nquantitative metrics to support and implement our risk \nappetite statement. Our risk limits support linkages between \nthe overall risk appetite, which is reviewed by the Board, and \nmore granular risk-taking decisions and activities.\nRisk limits, once established, are reviewed and updated on at \nleast an annual basis, with more frequent updates as \nnecessary. Board-level risk limits address the most important \nFirmwide aggregations of risk . Additional risk limits \napproved by the FRC address more specific types of risk and \nare bound by the higher-level Board risk limits.\nRisk Management Process\nIn subsequent sections, we discuss our risk management \npolicies and procedures for our primary risks  involved in the \nactivities of  our Institutional Securities, Wealth Management \nand Investment Management business segments . These \nsections and the estimated amounts of our risk exposure \ngenerated by our statistical analyses are forward-looking \nstatements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks \nare not predictions of future events, and actual results may \nvary significantly from such analyses due to events in the \nmarkets in which we operate and certain other factors \ndescribed in the following paragraphs.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one \nor more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, \ncorrelations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, \nwill result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we \nincur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client \nfacilitation activities, principally within the Institutional \nSecurities business segment where the substantial majority of \nour VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, \nwe incur non-trading market risk, principally within the \nWealth Management and Investment Management business \nsegments. The Wealth Management business segment \nprimarily incurs non-trading market risk (including interest \nrate risk) from lending and deposit-taking activities. The \nInvestment Management business segment primarily incurs \nnon-trading market risk from capital investments in its funds. \nMarket risk also includes non-trading interest rate risk. Non-\ntrading interest rate risk in the banking book (amounts \nclassified for regulatory capital purposes under the banking \nbook regime) refers to the exposure that a change in interest \nrates will result in prospective earnings changes for assets and \nliabilities in the banking book.Sound market risk management is an integral part of our \nculture. The various business units and trading desks are \nresponsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-\nmanaged and prudent. The control groups help ensure that \nthese risks are measured and closely monitored and are made \ntransparent to senior management. The Market Risk \nDepartment is responsible for ensuring the transparency of \nmaterial market risks, monitoring compliance with established \nlimits and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior \nmanagement.\nTo execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department \nmonitors our risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, \nperforms a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk \nsummaries, and maintains our VaR and scenario analysis \nsystems. Market risk is also monitored through various \nmeasures: by use of statistics (including VaR and related \nanalytical measures); by measures of position  size and \nsensitivity ; and through routine stress testing, which measures \nthe impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified \nchanges in market factors and scenarios designed by the \nMarket Risk Department in collaboration with the business \nunits. The material risks identified by these processes are \nsummarized in reports produced by the Market Risk \nDepartment that are circulated to and discussed with senior \nmanagement, the FRC, the BRC and the Board.\nTrading Risks\nPrimary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk \nManagement\nWe have  exposures  to a wide range of risks related to interest \nrates and credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates \nand commodity prices as well as the associated implied \nvolatilities and spreads of the global markets in which we \nconduct our trading activities.\nWe are exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a \nresult of our market-making activities and other trading in \ninterest rate-sensitive financial instruments (i.e., risk arising \nfrom changes in the level or implied volatility of interest \nrates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the \nyield curve and/or credit spreads).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5007, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4227a439-2a88-4eff-8744-8b9dea617b76": {"__data__": {"id_": "4227a439-2a88-4eff-8744-8b9dea617b76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b38de51-e5b3-4cee-b5d9-0b597c507ddc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "383e20fd205e3a34b5dc2a002bf61a874709c4493fe339a6dffdc3184d63e5d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09843550-fcd8-441b-b588-0f7716884a0c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1e8e277717c65d91939fda7cef9092c01aaeb8e482accfc895821eb3f04d891e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc5f9b0d-72fe-4b08-bffb-c7b8f48f5eed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "908e32e88ab4e32ad1b6ace4e30781dcc278b426282fcf713b8d484dad4d6fd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d4e77328eccea3f288a4d3a35822791b4e01e378212139ee10936e18f5817b0b", "text": "The material risks identified by these processes are \nsummarized in reports produced by the Market Risk \nDepartment that are circulated to and discussed with senior \nmanagement, the FRC, the BRC and the Board.\nTrading Risks\nPrimary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk \nManagement\nWe have  exposures  to a wide range of risks related to interest \nrates and credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates \nand commodity prices as well as the associated implied \nvolatilities and spreads of the global markets in which we \nconduct our trading activities.\nWe are exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a \nresult of our market-making activities and other trading in \ninterest rate-sensitive financial instruments (i.e., risk arising \nfrom changes in the level or implied volatility of interest \nrates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the \nyield curve and/or credit spreads).

Commodity exposures are subject to periods \nof high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and \ndemand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; \nphysical production and transportation; or geopolitical and \nother events that affect the available supply and level of \ndemand for these commodities.\nWe manage our trading positions by employing a variety of \nrisk mitigation strategies. These strategies include \ndiversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging \nactivities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related \nsecurities and financial instruments, including a variety of \nderivative products ( e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and \noptions). Hedging activities may not always provide effective \nmitigation against trading losses due to differences in the \nterms, specific characteristics or other basis risks that may \nexist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that \nis being hedged.\nWe manage the market risk associated with our trading \nactivities on a Firmwide basis, on a worldwide trading \ndivision level and on an individual product basis.

The Market Risk Department \ncalculates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to \nvarious levels of management.\nWe estimate VaR using a model based on a one-year equal \nweighted historical simulation for general market risk factors \nand name-specific risk in corporate  equities  and related \nderivatives, and Monte Carlo simulation for name-specific \nrisk in bonds, loans and related derivatives. The model \nconstructs a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the \nvalue of trading portfolios based on historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market risk \nfactors, and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio \nvalues to these market risk factor changes.\nVaR for risk management purposes (\u201cManagement VaR\u201d) is \ncomputed at a 95% level of confidence over a one-day time \nhorizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading losses \nresulting from adverse daily market moves. The 95%/one-day \nVaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, \nbased on historically observed market risk factor movements, \nwould have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five \ntimes in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held \nconstant for one day.\nOur VaR model generally takes into account linear and non-\nlinear exposures to equity and commodity price risk, interest \nrate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange rates. The \nmodel also takes into account linear exposures to implied \nvolatility risks for all asset classes and non-linear exposures to \nimplied volatility risks for equity, commodity and foreign \nexchange referenced products. The VaR model also captures \ncertain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio \ncredit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks (e.g.,  corporate \ndebt and related credit derivatives).\nWe use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools. \nAmong their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a \nportfolio\u2019s aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a \nrange of varied market risks and portfolio assets.

The CRM  approves extensions of credit, evaluates the \ncreditworthiness of the counterparties and borrowers on a \nregular basis, and helps ensure that credit exposure is actively \nmonitored and managed. The evaluation of counterparties and \nborrowers includes an assessment of the probability that an \nobligor will default on its financial obligations and any losses \nthat may occur when an obligor defaults. In addition, credit \nrisk exposure is actively managed by credit professionals and \ncommittees within  the CRM  and through various risk \ncommittees, whose membership includes individuals from the \nCRM. A comprehensive and global Credit Limits Framework is utilized to manage credit risk levels across the Firm. The \nCredit Limits Framework is calibrated within our risk \ntolerance and includes single-name limits and portfolio \nconcentration limits by country, industry and product type.\nThe CRM h elps ensure timely and transparent communication \nof material credit risks, compliance with established limits \nand escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior \nmanagement. The CRM also works closely with the Market \nRisk Department and applicable business units to monitor risk \nexposures and to perform stress tests to identify, analyze and \ncontrol credit risk concentrations arising from lending and \ntrading activities. The stress tests shock market factors ( e.g., \ninterest rates, commodity prices, credit spreads), risk \nparameters ( e.g., probability of default and loss given default), \nrecovery rates and expected losses in order to assess the \nimpact of stresses on exposures, profit and loss, and our \ncapital position. Stress tests are conducted in accordance with \nour established policies and procedures.\nCredit Evaluation\nThe evaluation of corporate and institutional counterparties \nand borrowers includes assigning credit ratings, which reflect \nan assessment of an obligor\u2019s probability of default and loss \ngiven default. Credit evaluations typically involve the \nassessment of financial statements; leverage; liquidity; capital \nstrength; asset composition and quality; market capitalization; \naccess to capital markets; adequacy of collateral, if \napplicable; and, in the case of certain loans, cash flow \nprojections and debt service requirements. The CRM  also \nevaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, \nmanagement and other factors  such as country risks and legal \nand contingent risks  that could affect the obligor\u2019s risk \nprofile. Additionally, the CRM evaluates the relative position \nof our exposure in the borrower\u2019s capital structure and \nrelative recovery prospects, as well as other structural \nelements of the particular transaction.\nThe evaluation of consumer borrowers is tailored to the \nspecific type of lending.

The buyer typically pays a periodic premium over the \nlife of the contract and is protected for the period. If a credit \nevent occurs, the seller is required to make payment to the \nbeneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivative \ncontract. Credit events, as defined in the contract, may be one \nor more of the following defined events: bankruptcy, \ndissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to \npay, obligation acceleration, repudiation, payment \nmoratorium and restructuring.\nWe trade in a variety of credit derivatives and may either \npurchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio of \nreferenced entities. In transactions referencing a portfolio of \nentities or securities, protection may be limited to a tranche of \nexposure or a single name within the portfolio. We are an \nactive market maker in the credit derivatives markets. As a \nmarket m aker, we work to earn a bid-offer spread on client \nflow business and manage any residual credit or correlation \nrisk on a portfolio basis. Further, we use credit derivatives to \nmanage our exposure to residential and commercial mortgage \nloans and corporate lending exposures. The effectiveness of \nour CDS protection as a hedge of our exposures may vary \ndepending upon a number of factors, including the contractual \nterms of the CDS.\nWe actively monitor our counterparty credit risk related to \ncredit derivatives. A majority of our counterparties are \ncomposed of banks, broker-dealers, insurance and other \nfinancial institutions. Contracts with these counterparties may \ninclude provisions related to counterparty rating downgrades, \nwhich may result in the counterparty posting additional \ncollateral to us. As with all derivative contracts, we consider \ncounterparty credit risk in the valuation of our positions and \nrecognize CVAs as appropriate within Trading revenues in \nthe income statement.\nFor additional credit exposure information on our credit \nderivative portfolio, see Note 7  to the financial statements.Table of Contents  \nRisk Disclosures\n65 December 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 1907, "end_char_idx": 4522, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78bb7dfe-095f-450c-84a7-9fca92a0b8fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "78bb7dfe-095f-450c-84a7-9fca92a0b8fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "436ff189-d242-4d5a-8ccc-a5a252609824", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f687d682d990249f7f71afd3874dce9f026792b0f33545c6b86b2597093a279f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb6cf780-435e-4c85-a100-00e4cee2e200", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d1a470278cdf7916f6af45f0753fb3b41a00c8092d05ec7014b8c557b1c8b222", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "377b834c-39f7-402e-9aaf-41da95874c20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "926ff8ed19b610b28b3de046ed48993a9826baa34ef7f7ab50b24e3ca8ac98ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e85cb394176b2478a92aaa428f27d79484fbca083d36025115b2dc4e51b05a75", "text": "Country Risk\nCountry risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, \na foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might \nadversely affect us.

Further, the notional amount of the CDS \nadjusted for the fair value of the receivable or payable is \nreflected in the Net Inventory row based on the country of the \nunderlying reference entity.Top 10 Non-U.S. Country Exposures  at December 31, 2021  \n$ in millionsUnited \nKingdom Japan Germany France Spain\nSovereign\nNet inventory1$ 19 $ 5,353 $ (2,507) $ (688) $ (126) \nNet counterparty \nexposure2 10  78  96  8  41 \nExposure before \nhedges  29  5,431  (2,411)  (680)  (85) \nHedges3 (306)  (78)  (287)  (6)  \u2014 \nNet exposure $ (277) $ 5,353 $ (2,698) $ (686) $ (85) \nNon-sovereign\nNet inventory1$ 462 $ 933 $ 141 $ 11 $ 111 \nNet counterparty \nexposure2 13,922  3,742  2,762  2,913  649 \nLoans  3,787  451  1,617  537  2,893 \nLending commitments  6,899  174  4,839  3,901  1,276 \nExposure before \nhedges  25,070  5,300  9,359  7,362  4,929 \nHedges3 (1,755)  (154)  (1,454)  (2,072)  (739) \nNet exposure $ 23,315 $ 5,146 $ 7,905 $ 5,290 $ 4,190 \nTotal net exposure $ 23,038 $ 10,499 $ 5,207 $ 4,604 $ 4,105 \n$ in millions Brazil India Canada Korea China\nSovereign\nNet inventory1$ 2,536 $ 1,055 $ (256) $ 1,574 $ (309) \nNet counterparty \nexposure2 \u2014  5  25  236  34 \nExposure before \nhedges  2,536  1,060  (231)  1,810  (275) \nHedges3 (12)  \u2014  \u2014  (38)  (71) \nNet exposure $ 2,524 $ 1,060 $ (231) $ 1,772 $ (346) \nNon-sovereign\nNet inventory1$ 96 $ 829 $ 355 $ 87 $ 985 \nNet counterparty \nexposure2 254  931  1,216  718  571 \nLoans  285  220  184  46  473 \nLending commitments  274  \u2014  1,610  135  1,047 \nExposure before \nhedges  909  1,980  3,365  986  3,076 \nHedges3 (39)  \u2014  (120)  (13)  (152) \nNet exposure $ 870 $ 1,980 $ 3,245 $ 973 $ 2,924 \nTotal net exposure $ 3,394 $ 3,040 $ 3,014 $ 2,745 $ 2,578 \n1.Net inventory represents exposure to both long and short single-name and index \npositions ( i.e., bonds and equities at fair value and CDS based on a notional \namount assuming zero recovery adjusted for the fair value of any receivable or \npayable).\n2.Net counterparty exposure ( e.g, repurchase transactions, securities lending and \nOTC derivatives) is net of the benefit of collateral received and also is net by \ncounterparty when legally enforceable master netting agreements are in place.", "start_char_idx": 1575, "end_char_idx": 4486, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b40c9ac2-bc17-41aa-99b4-a11b943b15b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b40c9ac2-bc17-41aa-99b4-a11b943b15b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "436ff189-d242-4d5a-8ccc-a5a252609824", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f687d682d990249f7f71afd3874dce9f026792b0f33545c6b86b2597093a279f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "377b834c-39f7-402e-9aaf-41da95874c20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "926ff8ed19b610b28b3de046ed48993a9826baa34ef7f7ab50b24e3ca8ac98ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7112dbd1-7d6c-409e-9941-f31b64a23259", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ff4c1985b53a64cf3d7e6f46e015adb377bb637aa9a3ace7ab337b0eef067f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1d69d4f5c0f9f5104c19774de2dd212aa9b3c9895d7221fe76407918a35d2820", "text": "2.Net counterparty exposure ( e.g, repurchase transactions, securities lending and \nOTC derivatives) is net of the benefit of collateral received and also is net by \ncounterparty when legally enforceable master netting agreements are in place.

We may incur operational risk across the full scope of \nour business activities, including revenue-generating activities  \nand support and control groups ( e.g., information technology \nand trade processing).\nWe have established an operational risk framework to \nidentify, measure, monitor and control risk across the Firm. \nEffective operational risk management is essential to reducing \nthe impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, \nregulatory and reputational risks. The framework is \ncontinually evolving to account for changes in the Firm and to \nrespond to the changing regulatory and business environment.\nWe have implemented operational risk data and assessment \nsystems to monitor and analyze internal and external \noperational risk events, to assess business environment and \ninternal control factors, and to perform scenario analysis. The \ncollected data elements are incorporated in the operational \nrisk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative \nand qualitative elements. Internal loss data and scenario \nanalysis results are direct inputs to the capital model, while \nexternal operational incidents, business environment and \ninternal control factors are evaluated as part of the scenario \nanalysis process.\nIn addition, we employ a variety of risk processes and \nmitigants to manage our operational risk exposures. These \ninclude a governance framework, a comprehensive risk \nmanagement program and insurance. Operational risks and \nassociated risk exposures are assessed relative to the risk \ntolerance reviewed and confirmed by the Board and are \nprioritized accordingly.\nThe breadth and range of operational risk are such that the \ntypes of mitigating activities are wide-ranging. Examples of \nactivities include: continuous enhancement of defenses \nagainst cyber attacks; use of legal agreements and contracts to \ntransfer and/or limit operational risk exposures; due diligence; implementation of enhanced policies and procedures; \ntechnology change management controls; exception \nmanagement processing controls; and segregation of duties.\nPrimary responsibility for the management of operational risk \nis with the business segments, the control groups and the \nbusiness managers therein. The business managers maintain \nprocesses and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, \nmitigate and report operational risk. Each of the business \nsegments has a designated operational risk coordinator. The \noperational risk coordinator regularly reviews operational risk \nissues and reports to our senior management within each \nbusiness. Each control group also has a designated operational \nrisk coordinator and a forum for discussing operational risk \nmatters with our senior management. Oversight of operational \nrisk is provided by the Operational Risk Oversight \nCommittee, legal entity risk committees, regional risk \ncommittees and senior management. In the event of a merger; \njoint venture; divestiture; reorganization; or creation of a new \nlegal entity, a new product, or a business activity, operational \nrisks are considered, and any necessary changes in processes \nor controls are implemented.\nThe Operational Risk Department (\u201cORD\u201d) provides \nindependent oversight of operational risk and assesses, \nmeasures and monitors operational risk against tolerance. The \nORD works with the divisions and control groups to embed a \ntransparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for \nmanaging operational risk within each area and across the \nFirm.\nThe ORD scope includes oversight of technology risk, \ncybersecurity risk, information security risk, the fraud risk \nmanagement and prevention program, and third-party risk \nmanagement (supplier and affiliate risk oversight and \nassessment), among others.\nCybersecurity\nOur cybersecurity and information security policies, \nproced ures and technologies are designed to protect our own, \nour client and our employee data against unauthorized \ndisclosure, modification or misuse and are also designed to \naddress regulatory requirements.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4954, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15c5ce9d-def8-43a8-b6e8-8ba893da1abf": {"__data__": {"id_": "15c5ce9d-def8-43a8-b6e8-8ba893da1abf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4a6b1804-0a65-4ad2-95f7-84bb5e62f613", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2ba2d5f7e9cd8f5e4adece2bdb5794612424fc61ece4b54e1dda35c7ae7fe25d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7112dbd1-7d6c-409e-9941-f31b64a23259", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4ff4c1985b53a64cf3d7e6f46e015adb377bb637aa9a3ace7ab337b0eef067f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e46413ac-bc48-43c1-a145-7a16ebe87d20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3fcfed0354d33360ddd3c2eef028d9c74de0741eab372ca4ddd2dde8437672ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d9969ba09accc5c3634f085933e10eaccb3520d1a089d77e8740c745ff20e9ba", "text": "The Operational Risk Department (\u201cORD\u201d) provides \nindependent oversight of operational risk and assesses, \nmeasures and monitors operational risk against tolerance.

These services \ninclude, for example, outsourced processing and support \nfunctions and other professional services. Our risk-based \napproach to managing exposure to these services includes the \nperformance of due diligence, implementation of service level \nand other contractual agreements, consideration of operational \nrisks and ongoing monitoring of third-party suppliers\u2019 \nperformance. We maintain and continue to enhance our third-\nparty risk management progr am, wh ich is designed to align \nwith our risk tolerance and meet regulatory requirements. The \nprogram includes appropriate governance, policies, \nprocedures and enabling technology. The third-party risk \nmanagement program includes the adoption of appropriate \nrisk management controls and practices throughout the third-\nparty management life cycle to manage risk of service failure, \nrisk of data loss and reputational risk, among others. \nModel Risk\nModel risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences \nfrom decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. \nModel risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and \nstrategic decision making or damage to our reputation. The \nrisk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, \ncomplexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions.\nModel risk is generated from the use of models impacting \nfinancial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy \nassessments and the formulation of strategy.\nSound model risk management is an integral part of our Risk \nManagement Framework. The Model Risk Management \nDepartment (\u201cMRM\u201d) is a distinct department in Risk \nManagement responsible for the oversight of model risk.\nThe MRM  establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our \nrisk appetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the \nmateriality of the risk of financial loss or reputational damage \ndue to errors in design, implementation and/or inappropriate \nuse of models. The tolerance is monitored through model-\nspecific and aggregate business-level assessments, which are \nbased upon qualitative and quantitative factors.\nA guiding principle for managing model risk is the \u201ceffective \nchallenge\u201d of models. The effective challenge of models is \ndefined as critical analysis by objective, informed parties who \ncan identify model limitations and assumptions and drive \nappropriate changes. The MRM provides effective challenge \nof models, independently validates and approves models for \nuse, annually recertifies models, identifies and tracks \nremediation plans for model limitations and reports on model \nrisk metrics. The department also oversees the development of controls to support a complete and accurate Firmwide \nmodel inventory.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to \nfinance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital \nmarkets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk \nalso encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our \nfinancial obligations without experiencing significant \nbusiness disruption or reputational damage that may threaten \nour viability as a going concern.  Liquidity risk also \nencompasses the associated funding risks triggered by the \nmarket or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively \naffect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new \nfunding. Generally, we incur liquidity and funding risk as a \nresult of our trading, lending, investing and client facilitation \nactivities.\nOur Liquidity Risk Management Framework is critical to \nhelping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves \nand durable funding sources to meet our daily obligations and \nto withstand unanticipated stress events.

The \nintangibles included customer relationships of $1.5 billion and \nindefinite lived management contracts of $2.1 billion. \nManagement, with the assistance of a valuation specialist, \nestimated the fair value of the intangible assets by discounting \nthe forecasted future cash flows. The determination of fair value \nof the identified intangible assets involves significant estimates \nand assumptions related to forecasted future cash flows including \nrevenue growth rates and the selection of the discount rates.\nWe identified the valuation of customer relationship and \nindefinite lived management contract intangible assets as a \ncritical audit matter because the fair value determination requires \nmanagement to make significant estimates and assumptions in \ndetermining the forecasted future cash flows including revenue \ngrowth rates and the selection of the respective discount rates. \nPerforming audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of \nthese estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor \njudgment and an increased extent of effort, including the \ninvolvement of our valuation specialists.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation of customer \nrelationship and indefinite lived management contract intangible \nassets acquired as part of the Eaton Vance acquisition included \nthe following, among others:\n\u2022We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of \nchanges in assumptions on the valuation of the customer \nrelationship and indefinite lived management contract \nintangible assets.\n\u2022We tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over \nthe valuation methodology used, the determination of \nforecasted future cash flows, assumptions relating to revenue \ngrowth and the selection of the discount rates.\n\u2022We assessed the knowledge, skill, ability and objectivity of \nmanagement\u2019s valuation specialist and evaluated the work \nperformed.\n\u2022We evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation \nmethodology used and the reasonableness of the forecasted \nfuture cash flows for the customer relationship and indefinite \nlived management contract intangible assets, specifically the \nassumptions relating to the revenue growth rates. Further, we \nevaluated whether the assumptions used were reasonable \nconsidering external market and industry data as well as the \npast performance of Eaton Vance. \n\u2022We tested the source information underlying the determination \nof the revenue growth and discount rates and also tested the \nmathematical accuracy of the calculations.\n\u2022We developed a range of independent estimates of discount \nrates for the customer relationship and indefinite lived \nmanagement contract intangible assets and compared those to \nthe discount rates utilized by management.\n/s/

Unless the context otherwise \nrequires, the terms \u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d mean \nMorgan Stanley (the \u201cParent Company\u201d) together with its \nconsolidated subsidiaries. See the \u201cGlossary of Common \nTerms and Acronyms\u201d for the definition of certain terms and \nacronyms used throughout this Form  10-K.\nA description of the clients and principal products and \nservices of each of the Firm\u2019s business segments is as \nfollows:\nInstitutional Securities provides a variety of products and \nservices to corporations, governments, financial institutions \nand ultra-high net worth clients. Investment Banking \nservices consist of capital raising and financial advisory \nservices, including the underwriting of debt, equity and \nother securities, as well as advice on mergers and \nacquisitions, restructurings and project finance.

Lending \nactivities include originating corporate loans and \ncommercial real estate loans, providing secured lending \nfacilities, and extending securities-based and other \nfinancing to customers.

Strategies and products, which are offered \nthrough a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, \nfixed income, alternatives and solutions, and liquidity and \noverlay services. Institutional clients include defined \nbenefit/defined contribution plans, foundations, \nendowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, \ninsurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. Individual clients are generally served \nthrough intermediaries, including affiliated and non-\naffiliated distributors.\nBasis of Financial Information\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. \nGAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and \nassumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial \ninstruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, \nthe outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, \nACL, and other matters that affect its financial statements and \nrelated disclosures. The Firm believes that the estimates \nutilized in the preparation of its financial statements are \nprudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially \nfrom these estimates.  \nThe financial statements reflect the effects of the following \nreclassifications to prior period amounts. The Provision for \ncredit losses for loans and lending commitments is presented \nas a separate line in the income statements. Previously, the \nprovision for credit losses for loans was included in Other \nrevenues, and the provision for credit losses for lending \ncommitments was included in Other expenses. In addition, \neconomic hedges of certain held-for-sale and held-for-\ninvestment loans, which were previously reported in Trading \nrevenues, are reported in Other revenues.\nThe Notes are an integral part of the Firm\u2019s financial \nstatements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent events for \nadjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements \nthrough the date of this report and has not identified any \nrecordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in \nthese financial statements or the notes thereto.\nConsolidation\nThe financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its \nwholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the \nFirm has a controlling financial interest, including certain \nVIEs (see  Note 16 ). Intercompany balances and transactions \nhave been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are \nnot wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests \nare referred to as Noncontrolling interests. The net income \nattributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is \npresented as Net income applicable to noncontrolling interests \nin the income statement.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5145, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "add15902-f32b-44f7-be98-7dc786e94845": {"__data__": {"id_": "add15902-f32b-44f7-be98-7dc786e94845", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "25a74d67-708f-42b8-ab10-89139fa9390e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9c5c43e0bbade71f3bcc0cc46f2e07a0d44703930746eba26b02f50b983fb5c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cce8521-e18d-46a2-a542-968c57ffe868", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "65447098e503ffce8f6fcba427334e20380863332214c906fd2b2ac72e37ec00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "56e72936-1c36-4ca6-af50-2f6a7b0fd809", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fb13ae66281d6d42ceeb12d250715688e661dfe155f80c1927b7edd8ceebbe6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "eb32d56b20532bbceeb59718c84c63af3db0a05909595476ef102a13a45ea45b", "text": "The Notes are an integral part of the Firm\u2019s financial \nstatements.

Significant Accounting Policies  \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when the promised goods or \nservices are delivered to our customers in an amount that is \nbased on the consideration the Firm expects to receive in \nexchange for those goods or services when such amounts are \nnot probable of significant reversal. \nInvestment Banking\nRevenues from investment banking activities consist of \nrevenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and \nfixed income securities and loan syndications, and advisory \nfees, primarily for mergers, acquisitions and restructurings. \nUnderwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date \nif there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount \nto be paid. Underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related \nunderwriting revenues are recorded.\nAdvisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the \nclient, based on the estimated progress of work and when \nrevenues are not probable of a significant reversal. Advisory \ncosts are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest \nexpenses line items, including those reimbursed.\nCommissions and Fees\nCommission and fee revenues generally result from \ntransaction-based arrangements in which the client is charged \na fee for the execution of transactions. Such revenues \nprimarily arise from transactions in equity securities; services \nrelated to sales and trading  activities; and sales of mutual \nfunds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and \noptions, as well as revenues from order flow payments for \ndirecting customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges, and \nmarket centers for execution. Commission and fee revenues \nare recognized on trade date when the performance obligation \nis satisfied.\nAsset Management Revenues\nAsset management, distribution and administration fees are \ngenerally based on related asset levels being managed, such as \nthe AUM of a customer\u2019s account or the net asset value of a \nfund.

Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions \nthe Firm believes other market participants would use in \npricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the \nbest information available in the circumstances. The fair value \nhierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the \nobservability of inputs as follows, with Level 1 being the \nhighest and Level 3 being the lowest level:\nLevel 1.    Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets \nthat the Firm has the ability to access for identical assets or \nliabilities. Valuation adjustments, block discounts and \ndiscounts for entity-specific restrictions that would not \ntransfer to market participants are not applied to Level 1 \ninstruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that \nare readily and regularly available in an active market, \nvaluation of these products does not entail a significant degree \nof judgment.\nLevel 2.     Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in \nmarkets that are not active or for which all significant inputs \nare observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3.    Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable \nand significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from product to \nproduct and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including \nthe type of product, whether the product is new and not yet \nestablished in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and \nother characteristics particular to the product. To the extent \nthat valuation is based on models or inputs that are less \nobservable or unobservable in the market, the determination \nof fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree \nof judgment exercised by the Firm in determining fair value is \ngreatest for instruments categorized in Level 3 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy.\nThe Firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the \nmeasurement date, including during periods of market \ndislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability \nof prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. \nThis condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified \nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall \ninto different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, \nthe total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate \nfor the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair \nvalue of the asset or liability.\nValuation Techniques\nMany cash instruments and OTC derivative contracts have bid \nand ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid \nprices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for \nan asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing to accept for an asset. The Firm carries positions at the \npoint within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of \nfair value. For offsetting positions in the same financial \ninstrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to \nmeasure both the long and short positions.\nFair value for many cash instruments and OTC derivative \ncontracts is derived using pricing models. Pricing models take \ninto account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, \nincluding, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, \ninterest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, \ncreditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the \nFirm, option volatility and currency rates.\nWhere appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account \nfor various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask \nadjustments), credit quality, model uncertain ty, and \nconcentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value . \nAdjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived mid-\nmarket amounts of Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments \nfor the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflect \nthe exit price of a risk position.

The methodology \nfor measuring FVA leverages the Firm\u2019s existing credit-\nrelated valuation adjustment calculation methodologies, \nwhich apply to both assets and liabilities.\nSee Note 5  for a description of valuation techniques applied to \nthe major categories of financial instruments measured at fair \nvalue.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-\nrecurring Basis\nCertain of the Firm\u2019s assets and liabilities are measured at fair \nvalue on a non-recurring basis. The Firm incurs losses or \ngains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair \nvalue.\nFor assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis, fair value is determined by using various \nvaluation approaches. The same hierarchy for inputs as \ndescribed above, which requires that observable inputs be \nused when available, is used in measuring fair value for these \nitems.\nFor further information on financial assets and liabilities that \nare measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring \nbasis, see Note 5 .\nOffsetting of Derivative Instruments\nIn connection with its derivative activities, the Firm generally \nenters into master netting agreements and collateral \nagreements with its counterparties. These agreements provide \nthe Firm with the right, in the event of a default by the \ncounterparty, to net a counterparty\u2019s rights and obligations \nunder the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash \ncollateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty. \nDerivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are \nreported net of cash collateral received and posted.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, the Firm may not have \nsuch an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime \nmay not support the enforceability of the master netting \nagreement or collateral agreement; or the Firm may not have \nsought legal advice to support the enforceability of the \nagreement. In cases where the Firm has not determined an \nagreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not \noffset (see Note 7 ).The Firm\u2019s policy is generally to receive cash and/or \nsecurities posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), \nirrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the \nmaster netting and collateral agreement. In certain cases, the \nFirm may agree for such collateral to be posted to a third-\nparty custodian under a control agreement that enables it to \ntake control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty \ndefault. The enforceability of the master netting agreement is \ntaken into account in the Firm\u2019s risk management practices \nand application of counterparty credit limits.\nFor information related to offsetting of derivatives, see Note \n7.\nHedge Accounting\nThe Firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative \nfinancial instruments for the following types of hedges: \nhedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due \nto the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net \ninvestments in foreign operations whose functional currency \nis different from the reporting currency of the Parent \nCompany (net investment hedges).

If the fair \nvalue is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is \nequal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, \nlimited to the carrying amount .\nThe estimated fair values are derived based on valuation \ntechniques the Firm believes market participants would use. \nThe estimated fair values are generally determined by \nutilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or \nmethodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-\nearnings multiples of certain comparable companies for \ngoodwill impairment testing.\nIntangible assets with a finite life are amortized over their \nestimated useful life and are reviewed for impairment on an \ninterim basis when impairment indicators are present. \nImpairment losses are recorded within Other expenses in the \nincome statement.\nEarnings per Common Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing earnings available to \nMorgan Stanley common shareholders by the weighted \naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. \nEarnings available to Morgan Stanley common shareholders \nrepresents net income applicable to Morgan Stanley reduced \nby preferred stock dividends. Common shares outstanding \ninclude common stock and vested RSUs where recipients \nhave satisfied the relevant vesting terms. Diluted EPS reflects \nthe assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.\nShare-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to \nvesting are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive) \nunder the treasury stock method.\nThe Firm has granted PSUs that vest and convert to shares of \ncommon stock only if predetermined performance and market \ngoals are satisfied. Since the issuance of the shares is \ncontingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the \nPSUs are included in diluted EPS based on the number of \nshares (if any) that would be issuable if the reporting date was \nthe end of the performance period.\nFor further information on diluted earnings (loss) per \ncommon share, see Note 18  to the financial statements.\nDeferred Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Firm measures compensation expense for stock-based \nawards at fair value. The Firm determines the fair value of \nRSUs (including PSUs with non-market performance \nconditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common \nstock, measured as the volume-weighted average price on the date of grant (\u201cVWAP\u201d). The fair value of RSUs not entitled \nto dividends until conversion is measured at VWAP reduced \nby the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the \nunderlying shares prior to scheduled conversion date. PSUs \nthat contain market-based conditions are valued using a \nMonte Carlo valuation model.\nCompensation expense is recognized over the vesting period \nrelevant to each separately vesting portion of the award. \nCompensation expense for awards with performance \nconditions is recognized based on the probable outcome of the \nperformance condition at each reporting date. Compensation \nexpense for awards with market-based conditions is \nrecognized irrespective of the probability of the market \ncondition being achieved and is not reversed if the market \ncondition is not met. The Firm accounts for forfeitures as they \noccur.\nStock-based awards generally contain clawback and \ncancellation provisions. Certain awards provide the Firm \ndiscretion to claw back or cancel all or a portion of the award \nunder specified circumstances. Compensation expense for \nthose awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the \nFirm\u2019s common stock or the relevant model valuation, as \nappropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration.\nEmployee Stock Trusts\nIn connection with certain stock-based compensation plans, \nthe Firm has established employee stock trusts to provide, at \nits discretion, common stock voting rights to certain RSU \nholders.

Changes in the value of such investments \nare recorded in Trading revenues and Investments revenues. \nAlthough changes in compensation expense resulting from \nchanges in the fair value of the referenced investments will \ngenerally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments \nmade by the Firm, there is typically a timing difference \nbetween the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the \nFirm\u2019s investments and the deferred recognition of the related \ncompensation expense over the vesting period.\nRetirement-Eligible Employee Compensation\nFor year-end stock-based awards and deferred cash-based \ncompensation awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-\neligible employees under award terms that do not contain a \nfuture service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated \ncost of the awards over the course of the calendar year \npreceding the grant date, which reflects the period over which \nthe compensation is earned.\nCarried Interest Compensation\nThe Firm generally recognizes compensation expense for any \nportion of carried interest (both realized and unrealized) that \nis allocated to employees.  For information on performance-\nbased fees in the form of carried interest, which are directly \nrelated to carried interest compensation, see \u201cRevenue \nRecognition\u2014Carried Interest\u201d herein.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the \ntemporary differences between the financial statement and \nincome tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently \nenacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences \nare expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax \nexpense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment \ndate. Such effects are recorded in Provision for income tax es \nregardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded.\nThe Firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that \nit believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. \nIn making such a determination, the Firm considers all \navailable positive and negative evidence, including future \nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected \nfuture taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of \nrecent operations. When performing the assessment, the Firm \nconsiders all types of deferred tax assets in combination with \neach other, regardless of the origin of the underlying \ntemporary difference. If a deferred tax asset is determined to \nbe unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. If the \nFirm subsequently determines that it would be able to realize \ndeferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, it \nwould make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation \nallowance, which would reduce the provision for income \ntaxes.\nThe Firm recognizes tax expense associated with Global \nIntangible Low-Taxed Income as it is incurred as part of the current income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current \nperiod.\nUncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step \nprocess, whereby (i) the Firm determines whether it is more \nlikely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the \nbasis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those \ntax positions that meet this threshold, the Firm recognizes the \nlargest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be \nrealized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax \nauthority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax \nbenefits are recognized as a component of the provision for \nincome taxes.\nForeign Currencies\nAssets and liabilities of operations with non-U.S. dollar \nfunctional currencies are translated at year-end rates of \nexchange. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign \ncurrency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and \nrelated tax effects, are reflected in AOCI in the balance sheet. \nGains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign \ncurrency transactions are included in net income, and amounts \nrecognized in the income statement are translated at the rate \nof exchange on the respective date of recognition for each \namount.\nAccounting Updates Adopted in 2020\nReference Rate Reform\nThe Firm has adopted the Reference Rate Reform accounting \nupdate.

The Firm is applying the accounting \nrelief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship \nmodifications are made during the course of the reference rate \nreform transition period.

The Firm manages its exposure to these \nderivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation \nstrategies, which include managing the credit and correlation \nrisk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, \ntranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. Aggregate \nmarket risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, \nand market risk measures are routinely monitored against \nthese limits. The Firm may also recover amounts on the \nunderlying reference obligation delivered to the Firm under \nCDS where credit protection was sold.\nSingle-Name CDS.     A CDS protects the buyer against the \nloss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the \nissuer. The protection buyer pays a periodic premium \n(generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is \nprotected for the period. The Firm, in turn, performs under a \nCDS if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. \nTypical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or \ninsolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and \nrestructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.\nIndex and Basket CDS.    Index and basket CDS are products \nwhere credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-\nname CDS. Generally, in the event of a default on one of the \nunderlying names, the Firm pays a pro rata portion of the total \nnotional amount of the CDS.\nThe Firm also enters into tranched index and basket CDS \nwhere credit protection is provided on a particular portion of \nthe portfolio loss distribution. The most junior tranches cover \ninitial defaults, and once losses exceed the notional of the \ntranche, they are passed on to the next most senior tranche in \nthe capital structure.\nOther Credit Contracts.     The Firm has invested in CLNs and \nCDOs, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded \nderivatives, in which credit protection has been sold to the \nissuer of the note. If there is a credit event of a reference \nentity underlying the instrument, the principal balance of the \nnote may not be repaid in full to the Firm.8.

Under \nthese arrangements, the Firm receives collateral, which \nincludes U.S. government and agency securities, other \nsovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, \nand corporate equities.

Factors considered in the review \nof margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended \npurpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the \naccount and the amount of collateral, as well as an overall \nevaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, \nin the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of \nthe underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to \nreduce risk. Underlying collateral for margin loans is \nreviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed \ncollateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading \nrange, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry \nconcentrations. For these transactions, adherence to the \nFirm\u2019s collateral policies significantly limits its credit \nexposure in the event of a customer default. The Firm may \nrequest additional margin collateral from customers, if \nappropriate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have \nnot been paid for or purchase securities sold but not delivered \nfrom customers.\nAlso included in the amounts in the previous table is non-\npurpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities in the \nWealth Management business segment.\nOther Secured Financings\nOther secured financings include the liabilities related to \ntransfers of financial assets that are accounted for as \nfinancings rather than sales, consolidated VIEs where the \nFirm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and certain \nELNs and other secured borrowings. These liabilities are \ngenerally payable from the cash flows of the related assets, \nwhich are accounted for as Trading assets (see Notes 14 and \n16).10.

For Corporate, \nSecured lending facilities and Other loans, credit evaluations \ntypically involve the evaluation of financial statements, \nassessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset \ncomposition and quality, market capitalization and access to \ncapital markets, cash flow projections and debt service \nrequirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable. \nThe CRM also evaluates strategy, market position, industry \ndynamics, obligor\u2019s management and other factors that could \naffect an obligor\u2019s risk profile. \nFor Commercial real estate loans, the credit evaluation is \nfocused on property and transaction metrics, including \nproperty type, LTV ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, \nprevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics.\nFor Residential real estate and Securities-based loans, the \ninitial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited \nto, review of the obligor\u2019s income, net worth, liquidity, \ncollateral, LTV ratio and credit bureau information. \nSubsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans \nis performed at the portfolio level.

The recourse amount often \nexceeds the maximum potential payout amount of the \nguarantee. Substantially all of the underlying assets in the \nSPEs are investment grade.

Since the \nFirm no longer services these loans, it has no information on \nthe current UPB of those loans,  and, accordi ngly, the amount \nincluded in the previous table represents the UPB at the time \nof the whole loan sale or at the time when the Firm last \nserviced any of those loans. The current UPB balances could \nbe substantially lower than the maximum potential payout \namount included in the previous table.

The maximum potential amount \nof future payments the Firm could be required to make would \nbe equal to the current outstanding balances of, or losses \nassociated with, the assets subject to breaches of such \nrepresentations and warranties. The amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the \ncurrent UPB or historical losses where known  and the UPB at \nthe time of sale when the current UPB is not known.\nGeneral Partner Guarantees.  As a general partner in certain \ninvestment management funds, the Firm receives certain \ndistributions from the partnerships when the return exceeds \nspecified performance targets according to the provisions of \nthe partnership agreements.

The Firm is  a sponsoring \nmember of the Government Securities Division of the FICC's \nSponsored Clearing Model. Clients of the Firm, as sponsored \nmembers, can transact in overnight  and term securities  \nrepurchase and resale agreements,  which are cleared through \nthe FICC. As sponsoring member, the Firm guarantees to the \nFICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its \nclients\u2019 obligations. In 2020, the FICC\u2019s sponsored clearing \nmodel was updated such that the Firm could be responsible \nfor liquidation of a sponsored member\u2019s account and \nguarantees any resulting loss to the FICC in the event the \nsponsored member fails to fully pay any net liquidation \namount due from the sponsored member to the FICC. \nAccordingly, the Firm\u2019s maximum potential payout amount \nreflects the total of the estimated net liquidation amounts for \nsponsored member accounts. The Firm minimizes credit \nexposure under this guarantee by obtaining a security interest \nin its sponsored member clients\u2019 collateral and their \ncontractual rights under sponsored member transactions. \nTherefore, the Firm's exposure is estimated to be an amount \nsubstantially lower than the maximum potential payout \namount. The collateral amount in which the Firm has a \nsecurity interest is approximately equal to the maximum \npotential payout amount of the guarantee.\nOther Guarantees and Indemnities\nIn the normal course of business, the Firm provides \nguarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. \nThese provisions generally are standard contractual terms. \nCertain of these guarantees and indemnifications are \ndescribed below:\n\u2022Indemnities . The Firm provides standard indemnities to \ncounterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, \nincluding U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest \nand other payments made on derivatives, securities and \nstock lending transactions, certain annuity products and \nother financial arrangements. These indemnity payments \ncould be required based on a change in the tax laws, a \nchange in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a \nchange in factual circumstances. Certain contracts contain \nprovisions that enable the Firm to terminate the agreement \nupon the occurrence of such events.

The Firm is \na member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that \ntrade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. \nAssociated with its membership, the Firm may be required \nto pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or \nthe clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members \nor pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of \nanother member that may default on its obligations to the \nexchange or the clearinghouse. While the rules governing \ndifferent exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the \nforms of these guarantees may vary, in general the Firm\u2019s \nobligations under these rules would arise only if the \nexchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its \nresources.\nIn addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to \nassume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the \nclearinghouse\u2019s investment of guarantee fund contributions \nand initial margin  and of other losses unrelated to the \ndefault of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the \nspecified resources allocated for such purpose by the \nclearinghouse.\nThe maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be \nestimated. The Firm has not recorded any contingent \nliability in its financial statements for these agreements and \nbelieves that any potential requirement to make payments \nunder these agreements is remote.\n\u2022Merger and Acquisition Guarantees.  The Firm may, from \ntime to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be \nrequired to provide guarantees in connection with certain \nEuropean merger and acquisition transactions. If required \nby the regulating authorities, the Firm provides a guarantee \nthat the acquirer in the transaction has or will have \nsufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then \nbe required to make the acquisition payments in the event \nthe acquirer\u2019s funds are insufficient at the completion date \nof the transaction. These arrangements generally cover the \ntime frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date \nand, therefore, are generally short term in nature. The Firm \nbelieves the likelihood of any payment by the Firm under \nthese arrangements is remote given the level of its due \ndiligence in its role as investment banking advisor.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Firm \nguarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations \n(including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign \nexchange contracts and the settlement of physical \ncommodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees \ngenerally are entity or product specific and are required by \ninvestors or trading counterparties. The activities of the \nFirm\u2019s subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including \nany related debt or trading obligations) are included in the \nfinancial statements.Contingencies\nLegal\nIn addition to the matters described in the following \nparagraphs, in the normal course of business, the Firm has \nbeen named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal \nactions, including arbitrations, class actions and other \nlitigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global \ndiversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual \nor threatened legal actions include claims for substantial \ncompensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for \nindeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities \nthat would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases \nare bankrupt or are in financial distress. These actions have \nincluded, but are not limited to, antitrust, false claims act, \nresidential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters.\nWhile the Firm has identified below any individual \nproceedings where the Firm believes a material loss to be \nreasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no \nassurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims \nthat have not yet been asserted or those where potential losses \nhave not yet been determined to be probable or possible  and \nreasonably estimable.\nThe Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as \nappropriate in each pending matter.

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization \nActivities  \nOverview\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course \nof business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be \nVIEs.\nThe Firm\u2019s variable interests in VIEs include debt and equity \ninterests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments \nand certain fees. The Firm\u2019s involvement with VIEs arises \nprimarily from:\n\u2022Interests purchased in connection with market-making \nactivities, securities held in its Investment securities \nportfolio and retained interests held as a result of \nsecuritization activities, including re-securitization \ntransactions.\n\u2022Guarantees issued and residual interests retained in \nconnection with municipal bond securitizations.\n\u2022Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, \nequity, real estate or other assets.\n\u2022Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n\u2022Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaging notes \ndesigned to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n\u2022Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-\nefficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a \nVIE upon its initial involvement with the VIE and reassesses \nwhether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as \nlong as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This \ndetermination is based upon an analysis of the design of the \nVIE, including the VIE\u2019s structure and activities, the power to \nmake significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by \nother parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and \nother parties.\nThe power to make the most significant economic decisions \nmay take a number of different forms in different types of VIEs. The Firm considers servicing or collateral management \ndecisions as representing the power to make the most \nsignificant economic decisions in transactions such as \nsecuritizations or CDOs. As a result, the Firm does not \nconsolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act \nas the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain \nother rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to \nrequire the liquidation of the entity. If the Firm serves as \nservicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights \ndescribed in the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the \ninterests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates only those \nVIEs for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the \nVIE.\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, \nCLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no \nsignificant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In \nthese cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made \nprior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the \ntermination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of \nthese transactions that decisions made prior to the initial \nclosing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors \nbased upon the nature of the assets, including whether the \nassets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the Firm and \nthe extent of the information available to the Firm and to \ninvestors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, \nother rights held by the Firm and investors, the \nstandardization of the legal documentation and the level of \ncontinuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount \nand type of interests owned by the Firm and by other \ninvestors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right \nheld by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the \nVIE.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4547, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a70f6bb4-1cbc-4fb0-83a1-2b8c5109b67f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a70f6bb4-1cbc-4fb0-83a1-2b8c5109b67f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e9edd9ef-b51c-4b0c-b6b7-740bc9d090c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d8523dfa6aae7cee89e81d2cf48b8f8d81e1dadf0f8e9456380adedea62b294d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f56418f-b1e7-4a36-826d-ca1c03e44833", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c5ef4c0e4955f42e461e8a6a25e7a047b6174e00207bbf5fb6b8d2fc59e28e40", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "92aac6f2-1c05-4cac-a661-465f42092054", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d31c371bc6a5cb524bd21a0720cb392e0ff211a141adeaa0b84b7cd21b00f77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e3625e9efd40a0e2d05cea2e41ff3b46b5851149709cfbff00da027e728fdcc0", "text": "In \nthese cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made \nprior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the \ntermination of the transaction.

The purchase \nof the transferred assets by the SPE is financed through the \nsale of these interests.\nIn many securitization transactions involving commercial \nmortgage loans, the Firm transfers a portion of the assets to \nthe SPE with unrelated parties transferring the remaining \nassets. In addition, mainly in securitization transactions \ninvolving residential mortgage loans, the Firm may also enter \ninto derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or \ninterest rate caps, with the SPE.\nAlthough not obligated, the Firm generally makes a market in \nthe securities issued by SPEs in securitization transactions. As \na market  maker, the Firm offers to buy these securities from, \nand sell the se securities to, investors. Securities purchased \nthrough these market-making activities are not considered to \nbe retained interests; these beneficial interests generally are \nincluded in Trading assets\u2014Corporate and other debt and are \nmeasured at fair value.\nThe Firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps \nand interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many \nsecuritization transactions. The risks associated with these and \nsimilar derivatives with SPEs are essentially the same as \nsimilar derivatives with non-SPE counterparties and are \nmanaged as part of the Firm\u2019s overall exposure. See Note 7  \nfor further information on derivative instruments and hedging \nactivities.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Firm holds securities issued by VIEs within the \nInvestment securities portfolio. These securities are composed \nof those related to transactions sponsored by the federal \nmortgage agencies and predominantly the most senior \nsecurities issued by VIEs backed by student loans and \ncommercial mortgage loans. Transactions sponsored by the \nfederal mortgage agencies include an explicit or implicit \nguarantee provided by the U.S. government. Additionally, the \nFirm holds certain commercial mortgage-backed securities \nissued by VIEs retained as a result of the Firm's securitization \nactivities. See Note 8  for further information on the \nInvestment securities portfolio.\nMunicipal Tender Option Bond Trusts\nIn a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client \ntransfers a municipal bond to a trust. The trust issues short-\nterm securities that the Firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to \ninvestors. The client generally retains a residual interest. The \nshort-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility \npursuant to which the investors may put their short-term \ninterests. In most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility; in some programs, the Firm \nprovides this liquidity facility.\nThe Firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for \nremarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. \nThe client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. \nThe liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction \nupon the occurrence of certain events. When the transaction is \nterminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to \nthe client. Any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon \nthe sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. This \nobligation is generally collateralized. Liquidity facilities \nprovided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified \nas derivatives. The Firm consolidates any municipal tender \noption bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.\nCredit Protection Purchased through Credit-Linked Notes\nCLN transactions are designed to provide investors with \nexposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. In these \ntransactions, the Firm transfers assets (generally high-quality \nsecurities or money market investments) to an SPE, enters \ninto a derivative transaction in which the SPE sells protection \non an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a \ncredit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the SPE to \ninvestors. In some transactions, the Firm may also enter into \ninterest rate or currency swaps with the SPE. Depending on \nthe structure, the assets and liabilities of the SPE may be \nconsolidated and recognized in the Firm\u2019s balance sheet or \naccounted for as a sale of assets.\nUpon the occurrence of a credit event related to the referenced \nasset, the SPE will deliver securities collateral as payment to \nthe Firm, which exposes the Firm to changes in the \ncollateral\u2019s value.\nDerivative payments by the SPE are collateralized.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4794, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f14fea00-d325-4a76-a5ae-877ca2fb3379": {"__data__": {"id_": "f14fea00-d325-4a76-a5ae-877ca2fb3379", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "07d5b394-6cac-44c9-983f-b3a313764175", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0a07c7d4c1963b6c17b90169d5ae36708107f80c9f58e8a60c9f34d8f0661d00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5fae6e35-0755-4125-9c18-fa65964a6064", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a162a29f40177d533066cd483e038a3390913a0a146ba2725e4405e7100c79ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc2a6a43-63cc-4dd6-be66-733dd588215a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01541c3726ecb044c58cc121227d30ae2f2641ac48ad442e5c2f247fd2005659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3d6327dbda057cb1d3202eba8b5e00811b1d0bf44248dff451dd3501702865c6", "text": "In these \ntransactions, the Firm transfers assets (generally high-quality \nsecurities or money market investments) to an SPE, enters \ninto a derivative transaction in which the SPE sells protection \non an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a \ncredit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the SPE to \ninvestors.

Regulatory Requirements  \nRegulatory Capital Framework\nThe Firm is an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of \n1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and \noversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). The Federal Reserve establishes \ncapital requirements for the Firm, including \u201c well-\ncapitalized \u201d standards, and evaluates the Firm\u2019s compliance \nwith such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar \ncapital requirements and standards for the Firm\u2019s U.S. bank \nsubsidiaries , including, among others, MSBNA and \nMSPBNA. The regulatory capital requirements are largely \nbased on the Basel III capital standards established by the \nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision and also implement \ncertain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act. In addition, many of the Firm\u2019s \nregulated subsidiaries are subject  to regulatory capital \nrequirements, including regulated subsidiaries provisionally \nregistered as swap dealers with the CFTC or conditionally \nregistered as security-based swap dealers with the SEC or \nregistered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and \nleverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital \nrequirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory \ncapital and RWA follows.\nRisk-Based Regulatory Capital.  Risk-based capital ratio \nrequirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 \ncapital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each \nas a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum \nrequired ratios plus the Firm\u2019s capital buffer requirement. \nCapital requirements require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these \nratios.\nCECL Deferral.  In 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted \na final rule, consistent with an interim final rule that was \neffective March 31, 2020, altering, for purposes of the \nregulatory capital rules, the required adoption time period for \nCECL. As of  December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,  the \nrisk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as \nwell as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary \nleverage exposure are calculated excluding the effect of the \nadoption of CECL based on the Firm\u2019s election to defer this \neffect over a five-year transition period that began on January \n1, 2020 in accordance with the final rule. The deferral impacts \nbegin to phase back in at 25% per year beginning in 2022 and \nbecome  fully phased-in beginning in 2025.\nCapital Buffer Requirements\nAt December 31, 2021  and \nDecember 31,

As a \nresult of the adoption, as of December 31, 2021 , the Firm's risk-weighted assets \nunder the Standardized Approach increased by $25 billion, and the Firm's \nStandardized Common Equity Tier 1  capital ratio decreased by 90 basis points. \n3.Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio \nand is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet \nassets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by \ndisallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined \nbenefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into \nsecuritizations, investments in the Firm\u2019s own capital instruments, certain defined \ntax assets and other capital deductions.  \n4.Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in \nthe Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, \npotential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit \nprotection, offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty \ncredit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-\nbalance sheet exposures.  \n5.The Firm\u2019s SLR and Supplementary leverage exposure as of December 31, 2020  \nreflect the exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve \nBanks based on a Federal Reserve interim final rule that was in effect until March \n31, 2021.\nCertain U.S. Bank Subsidiaries\u2019 Regulatory Capital and \nCapital Ratios\nThe OCC establishes capital requirements for the Firm\u2019s U.S.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3966, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cb25b00-ff4c-4b7d-a34b-d0524a1ea2d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cb25b00-ff4c-4b7d-a34b-d0524a1ea2d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4304890-2288-4af1-9f0d-bc8d866559dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d21970421eb6ccd0b5cd9c5087f6e3d5a0a50456606d2b0e5762b05f35e15161", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2626d7cc-a8be-4e54-8259-6e810faf1b45", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b768ba24fbaa787f476fe56ed04a41494a632dc020ac103cca5386b58de5e162", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d8b96d3-40d5-4930-a4bd-5cac0fce2899", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "369e08b511b3d45b0db3c100335417c69cdff31439f1f939fc2d4d43248433b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "57f5ac84d7e80c3a78ef9362e00a85eecfecbee00bf00d86df6a0eed121155ab", "text": "4.Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in \nthe Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, \npotential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit \nprotection, offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty \ncredit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-\nbalance sheet exposures.  \n5.The Firm\u2019s SLR and Supplementary leverage exposure as of December 31, 2020  \nreflect the exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve \nBanks based on a Federal Reserve interim final rule that was in effect until March \n31, 2021.\nCertain U.S. Bank Subsidiaries\u2019 Regulatory Capital and \nCapital Ratios\nThe OCC establishes capital requirements for the Firm\u2019s U.S. \nbank subsidiaries, which as of  December 31, 2021 and \nDecember 31, 2020 include, among others, Morgan Stanley \nBank, N.A.

OTC derivative contracts \nconsist of investments in interest rate swaps and total return \nswaps. Other investments consist of insurance contracts held \nby non-U.S.-based plans. The insurance contracts are valued \nbased on the premium reserve of the insurer for a guarantee \nthat the insurer has given to the employee benefit plan that \napproximates fair value.

Commingled trust funds \nare redeemable at NAV at the measurement date or in the near \nfuture.\nSome non-U.S.-based plans hold foreign funds that consist of \ninvestments in fixed income funds, target cash flow funds and \nliquidity funds. Fixed income funds invest in individual \nsecurities quoted on a recognized stock exchange or traded in \na regulated market. Certain fixed income funds aim to \nproduce returns consistent with certain Financial Times Stock \nExchange indexes. Target cash flow funds are designed to \nprovide a series of fixed annual cash flows achieved by \ninvesting in government bonds and derivatives. Liquidity \nfunds place a high priority on capital preservation, stable \nvalue and a high liquidity of assets. Foreign funds are readily \nredeemable at NAV.\nThe Firm generally considers the NAV of commingled trust \nfunds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be \nthe best estimate of fair value.\nExpected Contributions\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is to fund at least the amount sufficient to \nmeet minimum funding requirements under applicable \nemployee benefit and tax laws.

Our audit included \nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial \nreporting, \n \nassessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and \nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal \ncontrol based on the assessed risk, and performing such other \nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. \nWe believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our \nopinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over \nFinancial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a \nprocess designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding \nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of \nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s \ninternal control over financial reporting includes those \npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of \nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect \nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; \n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company \nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of \nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide \nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection \nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the \ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over \nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future \nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the \ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate.\n \n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 24, 2022\n Table of Contents\nDecember 2021 Form 10-K 144", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4114, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "610267ee-f237-4967-884d-9bfcb14053b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "610267ee-f237-4967-884d-9bfcb14053b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b6cf0292-529e-4a3e-82ae-0e35cfb2eaa0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "07649b0e1a64b284b79b4f2683ad0185f7553724a69c8641c121db70ea6a85cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "52c89443-0ebd-45ba-b4a9-67f95f544844", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "148", "file_name": "MS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2485901, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1c1f1d01b606ab5d0bb7461fcf97bc775fe464a3a0071b601c3a9b277304e94f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb7c4eb5-a279-43ea-8a33-f74727188e97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "508fac5d830250278f8e09077a12625cc5d68d819e89bdcf43680bf5b2337b30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "86ba0a969deb53a51fbec3615847345cdeb777a078ddfc3c5d543d3aeae8c700", "text": "Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo change in the Firm\u2019s internal control over financial \nreporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule \n13a-15(f)) occurred during the quarter ended December 31, \n2021  that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to \nmaterially affect, the Firm\u2019s internal control over financial \nreporting.\nOther Information\nNone.\nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that \nPrevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\nUnresolved Staff Comments\nThe Firm, like other well-known seasoned issuers, from time \nto time receives written comments from the staff of the SEC \nregarding its periodic or current reports under the Exchange \nAct.

Our current facilities are adequate for our present \nand future operations for each of our business segments, \nalthough we may add regional offices, depending upon our \nfuture operations.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn addition to the matters described below, in the normal \ncourse of business, the Firm has been named, from time to \ntime, as a defendant in various legal actions, including \narbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in \nconnection with its activities as a global diversified financial \nservices institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal \nactions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or \npunitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of \ndamages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be \nthe primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in \nfinancial distress.\nThe Firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, \ninvestigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by \ngovernmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the \nFirm\u2019s business,  and involving, among other matters, sales \nand trading activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the Firm, and accounting \nand operational matters, certain of which may result in \nadverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or \nother relief.\nThe Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as \nappropriate in each pending matter. Where available \ninformation indicates that it is probable a liability had been \nincurred at the date of the financial statements and the Firm \ncan reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm \naccrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. The Firm\u2019s \nfuture legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, \ngiven the current environment regarding government \ninvestigations and private litigation affecting global financial \nservices firms, including the Firm.\nIn many proceedings and investigations, however, it is \ninherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable \nor even pos sible  or to estimate the amount of any loss. The \nFirm cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such \nproceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the \neventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may \nbe, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the \nfactual record is being developed or contested or where \nplaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or \nindeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. \nNumerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or \nadditional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can \nbe reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, \nincluding through potentially lengthy discovery and \ndetermination of important factual matters, determination of \nissues related to class certification and the calculation of \ndamages or other relief, a nd consideration of  novel or \nunsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or \ninvestigations in question.
