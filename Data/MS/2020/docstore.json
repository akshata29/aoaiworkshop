Operating \nwithin the financial services industry on a global basis \npresents, among other things, technological, risk management, \nregulatory and other infrastructure challenges that require \neffective resource allocation in order for us to remain \ncompetitive. Our competitive position depends on a number of factors, including our reputation , the quality and \nconsistency of our long-term investment performance, \ninnovation, execution, relative pricing or other factors \nincluding entering into new, or expanding current, businesses \nas a result of acquisitions and other strategic  initiatives . Our \nability to sustain or improve our competitive position also \ndepends substantially on our ability to continue to attract and \nretain highly qualified employees while managing \ncompensation and other costs. We compete with commercial \nbanks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, exchanges, \nelectronic trading and clearing platforms, financial data \nrepositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds, energy companies, financial technology \nfirms and other companies offering financial or ancillary \nservices in the U.S., globally and digitally, including through \nthe internet. In addition, restrictive laws and regulations \napplicable to certain financial services institutions, which may \nprohibit us from engaging in certain transactions and impose \nmore stringent capital and liquidity requirements, can put us \nat a competitive disadvantage to competitors in certain \nbusinesses not subject to these same requirements.

Additionally, there \nis increased competition driven by established firms as well as \nthe emergence of new firms and business models (including \ninnovative uses of technology ) competing for the same clients \nand assets or offering similar products and services to retail \nand institutional customers.

These large BHCs also must \ncomply with a range of risk management and corporate \ngovernance requirements.Table of Contents\n3 December 2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 3865, "end_char_idx": 5742, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bb0610a-1ee3-43a0-8f51-db7643593a07": {"__data__": {"id_": "0bb0610a-1ee3-43a0-8f51-db7643593a07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "15496d97-6827-484e-9afa-ab852912630b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2c8a243cc2cf50194c7e7ecce7ffd2114e03668c74b7f981b2fa02ca64f020ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "81ccb34c-5761-4dc7-b7a9-0f235be70ca4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "00567131725c94afc6ab39efaa205945c521d3e99152085c8d0046983b55b5a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "026695cd-0872-4c9c-b304-32f84e73359b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "77dac70ee2f7b499ae15dd31eb1f61986ce1373734f67107182b4958acd7353d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f8619658a473526e49f785ac68006f8734f7ed379e1ecb800d6b541ec8904653", "text": "The Federal Reserve also impos es single-counterparty credit \nlimits (\u201cSCCL\u201d) for large banking organizations.

The rule also \nallows us to alternate between submitting a full, detailed \nresolution plan and a streamlined, targeted resolution plan. \nThe rule also clarifies the information required to be included \nin our resolution plan. Our next resolution plan, due July 1, \n2021, will be a targeted resolution plan  and will reflect our \nacquisition of E*TRADE.\nFurther, we submit an annual recovery plan to the Federal \nReserve that outlines the steps that management could take over time to generate or conserve financial resources in times \nof prolonged financial stress.\nCertain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries are also \nsubject to resolution and recovery planning requirements in \nthe jurisdictions in which they operate.

Many other jurisdictions have adopted or are \nproposing to adopt standards similar to the GDPR, including \nAustralia, Singapore, Japan, Argentina, India, Brazil, \nSwitzerland and the Cayman Islands. In addition, several \njurisdictions have enacted or proposed personal data \nlocalization requirements and restrictions on cross-border \ntransfer of personal data that may restrict our ability to \nconduct business in those jurisdictions or create additional \nfinancial and regulatory burdens to do so.\nMany aspects of our businesses are subject to legal \nrequirements concerning the use and protection of certain \ncustomer information.

Our \nprimary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley & \nCo.

Broker-dealers are \nsubject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the \nsecurities business, including sales and trading practices, \nsecurities offerings, publication of research reports, use of \ncustomers\u2019 funds and securities, capital structure, risk \nmanagement controls in connection with market access, \nrecordkeeping and retention, and the conduct of their \ndirectors, officers, representatives and other associated \npersons. Broker-dealers are also regulated by securities \nadministrators in those states where they do business. \nViolations of the laws and regulations governing a broker-\ndealer\u2019s actions could result in censures, fines, the issuance of \ncease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or \nregistrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities \nindustry of such broker-dealer or its officers or employees, or \nother similar consequences by both federal and state securities \nadministrators. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also \nmembers of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, \nwhich provides certain protections for customers of broker-\ndealers against losses in the event of the insolvency of a \nbroker-dealer.\nMSSB is also a registered investment adviser with the SEC. \nMSSB\u2019s relationship with its investment advisory clients is \nsubject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed on \ninvestment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of \n1940, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereund er as \nwell as various state securities laws. These laws and \nregulations generally grant the SEC and other supervisory \nbodies broad administrative powers to address non-compliance, including the power to restrict or limit MSSB \nfrom carrying on its investment advisory and other asset  \nmanagement activities. Other sanctions that may be imposed \ninclude the suspension of individual employees, limitations on \nengaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or \nfor specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, \nother censures and significant fines.\nThe Firm is subject to various regulations that affect broker-\ndealer sales practices and customer relationships. For \nexample, the SEC 's \u201cRegulation Best Interest,\u201d requires \nbroker-dealers to act in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of retail customers \nat the time a recommendation is made without placing the \nfinancial or other interests of the broker-dealer ahead of the \ninterest of the retail customer.

The commodity futures, commodity \noptions and swaps industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation \nunder the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d). The \nCFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the \nadministration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. \nfederal agency charged with the regulation of security-based \nswaps. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory \norganizations also govern derivatives.\nUnder the U.S. regulatory regime for swaps and security-\nbased swaps (collectively, \u201cSwaps\u201d) implemented pursuant to \nthe Dodd-Frank Act, we are subject to comprehensive \nregulation of our derivatives businesses, including regulations \nthat impose margin requirements, public and regulatory \nreporting, central clearing and mandatory trading on regulated \nexchanges or execution facilities for certain types of Swaps. \nCFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory \nclearing and execution of interest rate and certain credit \ndefault swaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to \nbusiness conduct standards for all in-scope  Swaps. We have \nregistered a number of U.S. and non U.S. C FTC swap dealers. \nIn 2020, the CFTC finalized rules establishing capital \nrequirements for CFTC-registered swap dealers not subject to \nregulation by a prudential regulator. Compliance with these \nrules is required by October 6, 2021.\nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security- \nbased swap dealers. The SEC's rules  impose  numerous \nobligations for entities that register as security-based swap \ndealers. Registration as a security-based swap dealer will be \nrequired starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, and compliance \nwith a number of these rules will also be required on a similar timeline. We anticipate registering several entities as a \nsecurity-based swap dealer.\nThe specific parameters of some of these requirements for \nSwaps have been and continue to be developed through \nCFTC, SEC and bank regulator rulemakings. For example, \nthe rules for variation margin are presently effective, and \nthose for initial margin will continue to phase  in based on \nactivity levels of the swap dealer and the relevant \ncounterparty with the final phase currently expected to begin \nin September 2022. Margin rules with the same or similar \ncompliance dates have been adopted or are in the process of \nbeing finalized by regulators outside the U.S., and certain of \nour subsidiaries may be subject to such rules. \nAlthough a significant number of areas within the global \nderivatives regulatory framework have been finalized, \nadditional changes are expected. As the derivatives regulatory \nframework continues to evolve, we expect to continue to face \nincreased costs and regulatory oversight. Complying with \nregistration and other regulatory requirements has required, \nand is expected to require in the future, systems and other \nchanges to our derivatives businesses.

Moreover, governments and central banks around the \nworld have reacted to the economic crisis caused by the \npandemic by implementing stimulus and liquidity programs \nand cutting interest rates, though it is unclear whether these or \nfuture actions will be successful in countering the economic \ndisruption. If the pandemic  continues to be  prolonged or the \nactions of governments and central banks are unsuccessful, \nincluding actions to facilitate the comprehensive  distribution \nof effective vaccines, the adverse impact on the global \neconomy will deepen, and our results of operations and \nfinancial condition in future quarters may  be adversely \naffected . \nShould global market conditions worsen, or the pandemic \nlead to additional market disruptions, we could experience \nreduced client activity and demand for our products and \nservices, higher credit and valuation losses in our loan and \ncommitment and investment portfolios, impairments of other \nfinancial assets and other negative impacts on our financial \nposition, including possible constraints on capital and \nliquidity, as well as a higher cost of capital, and possible \nchanges or downgrades to our credit ratings. In addition, \ncontinued low interest rates will limit interest margins in our \nlending businesses across Wealth Management and \nInstitutional Securities . A slowdown  of commercial activity \ncould cause overall sales and trading and investment banking \nrevenues to decline and a  decline  in assets under management \nand client balances could also reduce fee and financing \nrevenues across all of our business segments.  \nOperationally, we have initiated a work remotely protocol and \nrestricted business travel of our workforce, with a return-to-\nworkplace program, which is based on role, location  and \nemployee willingness and ability to return. While we have not experienced a decrease in productivity as a result of the \nremote work environment, there can be no assurance that the \ntransition will not have an adverse effect in the long term. If \nsignificant portions of our workforce, including key \npersonnel, are unable to work effectively because of illness, \ngovernment a ctions,  or other restrictions in connection with \nthe pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on our businesses \ncould be exacerbated.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related \nglobal economic crisis, affect s our businesses, results of \noperations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory \ncapital and liquidity ratios and our ability to take capital \nactions , will depend on future developments that are highly \nuncertain and cannot be predicted,  including the scope and \nduration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the \ndevelopment, distribution,  and acceptance of effective \nvaccines, future actions taken by governmental authorities, \ncentral banks and other third parties in response to the \npandemic, and the effects on our customers, counterparties, \nemployees and third-party service providers.

Market volatility, illiquid \nmarket conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may \nmake it extremely difficult to value and monetize certain of \nour financial instruments, particularly during periods of \nmarket displacement. Subsequent valuations in future periods, \nin light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant \nchanges in the values of these instruments and may adversely \nimpact historical or prospective fees and performance-based \nfees (also known as incentive fees, which include carried \ninterest) in respect of certain businesses. In addition, at the \ntime of any sales and settlements of these financial \ninstruments, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the \ndemand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be \nmaterially lower than their current fair value. Any of these \nfactors could cause a decline in the value of our financial \ninstruments, which may have an adverse effect on our results \nof operations in future periods.\nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events \nevidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied \nby a reduction in asset liquidity.

There is no guarantee that the \nmeasures we take will provide absolute security or \nrecoverability given the techniques used in cyber attacks are \ncomplex and frequently change, and may not be able to be \nanticipated. \nLike other financial services firms, the Firm, its third party \nproviders,  and its clients continue to be the subject of \nunauthorized access attacks,  mishandling or misuse of \ninformation, computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks \ndesigned to obtain confidential information, destroy data, \ndisrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other \ndamage,  denial of service attacks, data breaches, social \nengineering attacks and other events. There can be no \nassurance that such unauthorized access, mishandling or \nmisuse of information, or cyber incidents will not occur in the \nfuture, and they could occur more frequently and on a more \nsignificant scale.\nA cyber attack, information or security  breach or a technology \nfailure of ours or of a third party could jeopardize our or our \nclients\u2019, employees\u2019, partners\u2019, vendors\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 \npersonal, confidential, proprietary or other information \nprocessed and stored in, and transmitted through, our and our \nthird parties\u2019 computer systems.

Any of \nthese events could result in reputational damage with our \nclients and the market, client dissatisfaction, additional costs \nto us to maintain and update our operational and security \nsystems and infrastructure, regulatory investigations, \nlitigation or enforcement, or regulatory fines or penalties, any \nof which could adversely affect our business, financial \ncondition or results of operations.\nGiven our global footprint and the high volume of \ntransactions we process, the large number of clients, partners, \nvendors and counterparties with which we do business, and \nthe increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack, \ninformation or security breach could occur and persist for an \nextended period of time without detection. We expect that any \ninvestigation of a cyber attack would be inherently \nunpredictable and that it would take time before the \ncompletion of any investigation and before there is \navailability of full and reliable information. During such time \nwe would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how \nbest to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be \nrepeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would  further increase the \ncosts and consequences of a cyber attack.\nWhile many of our agreements with partners and  third par ty \nvendors include indemnification provisions, we may not be \nable to recover sufficiently, or at all, under such provisions to \nadequately offset any losses we may incur.

Ongoing implementation of, or changes \nin, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of, laws \nand regulations could materially impact the profitability of \nour businesses and the value of assets we hold, expose us to \nadditional costs, require changes to business practices or force \nus to discontinue businesses, adversely affect our ability to \npay dividends and repurchase our stock or require us to raise \ncapital, including in ways that may adversely impact our \nshareholders or creditors.\nIn addition, regulatory requirements that are being imposed \nby foreign policymakers and regulators may be inconsistent or \nconflict with regulations that we are subject to in the U.S. and \nmay adversely affect us.

If the Federal \nReserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that our \nresolution plan submission was not credible or would not \nfacilitate an orderly resolution, and if we were unable to \naddress any deficiencies identified by the regulators, we or \nany of our subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent \ncapital, lev erage, o r liquidity requirements or restrictions on \nour growth, acti vities, or operations, or after a two-year \nperiod, we may be required to divest assets or operations.\nIn addition, provided that certain procedures are met, we can \nbe subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly \nliquidation authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act \nwith the FDIC being appointed as receiver.

As a result, claims of our material entities, \nincluding the Funding IHC, against the assets of the Parent \nCompany with respect to such secured assets are effectively \nsenior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.\nAlthough an SPOE strategy, whether applied pursuant to our \nresolution plan or in a resolution proceeding under the orderly \nliquidation authority, is intended to result in better outcomes \nfor creditors overall, there is no guarantee that the application \nof an SPOE strategy, including the provision of support to the \nParent Company\u2019s material entities pursuant to the secured \namended and restated support agreement, will not result in \ngreater losses for holders of our securities compared to a \ndifferent resolution strategy for us.\nRegulators have taken and proposed various actions to \nfacilitate an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, \nthe orderly liquidation authority and other resolution regimes. \nFor example, the Federal Reserve requires top-tier BHCs of \nU.S. G-SIBs, including the Firm, to maintain minimum \namounts of equity and eligible long-term debt TLAC in order \nto ensure that such institutions have enough loss-absorbing \nresources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the \nconversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposing losses \non eligible TLAC where the SPOE strategy is used. The \ncombined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the \nTLAC requirement is that our losses will be imposed on the \nholders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible \nTLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are \nimposed on the creditors of our material entities or before \nputting U.S. taxpayers at risk.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and other \nE.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, or are in the process of \nimplementing, changes to resolution regimes to provide \nresolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing \nentity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain \nunsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities \ninto equity. Such \u201cbail-in\u201d powers are intended to enable the \nrecapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to \nits shareholders and unsecured creditors. Non-U.S. regulators \nare also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of \nlarge financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of \nTLAC that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the \nParent Company and, ultimately, to security holders of the \nParent Company in the event of failure.\nWe may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other \ncapital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised \nregulatory capital standards.\nWe are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, \nregulation and examination by the Federal Reserve, including \nwith respect to regulatory capital standards, stress testing and \ncapital planning. We submit, on at least an annual basis, a \ncapital plan to the Federal Reserve describing proposed \ndividend payments to shareholders, proposed repurchases of \nour outstanding securities and other proposed capital actions that we intend to take.  Our ability to take capital actions \ndescribed in the capital plan is dependent on, among other \nfactors, the results of supervisory stress tests conducted by the \nFederal Reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital \nstandards imposed by the Federal Reserve.\nIn addition , the Federal Reserve may change regulatory \ncapital standards to impose higher requirements that restrict \nour ability to take capital actions  or may  modify or impose \nother regulatory standards or restrictions that increase our \noperating expenses or constrain our ability to ta ke capital \nactions . For example,  on June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve \nannounced that it would bar share repurchases and limit \ncommon stock dividend payments in the third quarter of 2020 \nfor all large BHCs, and on September 30, 2020, the \nrestrictions were extended through the fourth quarter of 2020.  \nOn December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it \nwas extending capital action supervisory restrictions \napplicable to all large BHCs into the first quarter of 2021  with \nmodifications to permit resumptions of share repurchases.

For example, potential conflicts \ncan occur when there is a divergence of interests between us and a client, among clients, between an employee on the one \nhand and us or a client on the other, or situations in which we \nmay be a creditor of a client. Moreover, we also utilize \nmultiple brands and business channels, including those \nresulting from our acquisitions , and continue to enhance the \ncollaboration across business segments, which may heighten \nthe potential conflicts of interests or the risk of improper \nsharing of information.\nWe have policies, procedures and controls that are designed to \nidentify and address potential conflicts of interest, and we \nutilize various measures, such as the use of disclosure, to \nmanage these potential conflicts. However, identifying and \nmitigating potential conflicts of interest can be complex and \nchallenging and can become the focus of media and \nregulatory scrutiny.

We compete with commercial banks, brokerage \nfirms, insurance companies, exchanges, electronic trading and \nclearing platforms, financial data repositories, sponsors of \nmutual funds, hedge  funds, fund managers, energy \ncompanies, financial technology firms and other companies \noffering financial or ancillary services in the U.S., globally \nand digitally or through the internet. We compete on the basis \nof several factors, including transaction execution, capital or \naccess to capital, products and services, innovation, \ntechnology, reputation, risk appetite and price.\nOver time, certain sectors of the financial services industry \nhave become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a \nbroad range of financial services have left businesses, been \nacquired by or merged into other firms, or have declared \nbankruptcy. Such changes could result in our remaining \ncompetitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such \nas the ability to offer a broader range of products and services \nand geographic diversity, or new competitors may emerge.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience pricing \npressures as a result of these factors and as some of our \ncompetitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices , \neliminating commissions or other fees,  or providing more \nfavorable terms of business. In addition, certain of our \ncompetitors may be subject to different, and, in some cases, \nless stringent,  legal and regulatory regimes,  than we are, \nthereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage. Some new \ncompetitors in the financial technology sector have sought to \ntarget existing segments of our businesses that could be \nsusceptible to disruption by innovative or less regulated \nbusiness models.

In particular, the ability to \nexecute securities, derivatives and other financial instrument \ntrades electronically on exchanges, swap execution facilities, \nother automated trading platforms and the introduction and \napplication of new technologies has increased the pressure on \nbid-offer spreads, commissions, markups or comparable fees. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic \nmarkets will likely continue and will likely increase as \nadditional markets move to more automated trading \nplatforms.

A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair \nvalue that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs \nand minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by \nrequiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when \navailable. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, \nwherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, \nLevel 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in \nmarkets that are not active or for which all significant inputs \nare observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques \nthat incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, \ntherefore, require the greatest use of judgment. \nIn periods of market disruption, the observability of prices \nand inputs may be reduced for many instruments, which could \ncause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to \nLevel 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in \nmarket conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of \nmany instruments. For further information on the definition of \nfair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation \ntechniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity \nof significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value \nmeasurements, see Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements.\nWhere appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account \nfor various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask \nadjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, concentration \nrisk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. For a further \ndiscussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2  \nto the financial statements.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of \nJuly 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or \ncircumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment \nrequires management to make significant judgments. \nGoodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit \nlevel, which is generally at the level of or one level below our \nbusiness segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association \nwith a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a \nreporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, \nwhether acquired or organically developed, are available to \nsupport the value of the goodwill.\nFor both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to \neither (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first \nperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative \ntest would be performed.\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare \nthe fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, \nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is \nless than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is \nequal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, \nlimited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that \nreporting unit.\nThe estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived \nbased on valuation techniques we believe market participants \nwould use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair \nvalue is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash \nflow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable \ncompanies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, \neach of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that \nwas substantially in excess of its carrying value.\nIntangible  Assets\nAmortizable intangible assets are initially recorded at co st, or \nin the situation where acquired as part of  a business \ncombination, at the fair value determined  as part of the \nacquisition method of  accounting.  Subsequently, they are \ncarried in the balance sheets at amortized cost, where \namortization is recognized  over their estimated useful lives.\nWhen certain events or circumstances exist, amortizable \nintangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an interim \nbasis. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the \nintangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss \nwill be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible \nasset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The \ncarrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it \nexceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4754, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4620caf7-04e3-4b56-9809-54d3b8c7551c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4620caf7-04e3-4b56-9809-54d3b8c7551c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e44549e-503b-437b-9e29-6267739e43f4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ae48d0a63356b4e987b64eef7babe87c91b2af43364ba4aa05df12a346cdce3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "72b7b77c-4e6a-4bc7-a613-787c48103148", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c9fb2bc4e95c389426c099bbec640171d6d6b03bd575efd59fe38eb451fd0c91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3fd78eb2-1e1e-4202-95a6-106d857606b5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1fe5b6eb1cdab196db4567c5601fd16c6d2a797bb0aacd98b4b26ba040d59bfb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3dce2a7204130000ab99e8f1ebc3adbf5cded4dc8094311291bd0f29240db8c7", "text": "Intangible  Assets\nAmortizable intangible assets are initially recorded at co st, or \nin the situation where acquired as part of  a business \ncombination, at the fair value determined  as part of the \nacquisition method of  accounting.

Adverse market or economic events could result in \nimpairment charges in future periods.\nSee Notes  2, 3 and 11 to the financial statements for \nadditional information about goodwill and intangible assets.Table of Contents\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nDecember 2020 Form 10-K 44", "start_char_idx": 3893, "end_char_idx": 5749, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fd78eb2-1e1e-4202-95a6-106d857606b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fd78eb2-1e1e-4202-95a6-106d857606b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d20453d4-0709-4fcd-b008-33bbfb62980e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6dd3ec5e7dfdacfca66d640ecaa71626d59b4939e8706ca40eecd84fe68196a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4620caf7-04e3-4b56-9809-54d3b8c7551c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3dce2a7204130000ab99e8f1ebc3adbf5cded4dc8094311291bd0f29240db8c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b0218b5d-cb2d-4f36-83d1-d6f6303a980f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "677323986980fad2a9a9612e90d338e16ba7f748828d591707fd6e0962b7c48c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1fe5b6eb1cdab196db4567c5601fd16c6d2a797bb0aacd98b4b26ba040d59bfb", "text": "Legal  and Regulatory Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we have been named, from \ntime to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including \narbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in \nconnection with our activities as a global diversified financial \nservices institution.\nCertain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims \nfor substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or \nclaims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, \nthe entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in \nsuch cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress.\nWe are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, \ninvestigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by \ngovernmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our \nbusiness and involving, among other matters, sales and \ntrading activities, wealth and investment management \nservices, financial products or offerings sponsored, \nunderwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational \nmatters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, \nsettlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.\nAccruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are \ngenerally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where \navailable information indicates that it is probable a liability \nhad been incurred at the date of the financial statements and \nwe can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue \nthe estimated loss by a charge to income. \nIn many proceedings and investigations, however, it is \ninherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable \nor even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In \naddition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss \nexists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to \na previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always \npossible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or \nrange of loss, particularly for proceedings and investigations \nwhere the factual record is being developed or contested or \nwhere plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or \nindeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. \nNumerous  issues may need to be resolved before a loss or \nadditional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can \nbe reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, \nincluding through potentially lengthy discovery and \ndetermination of important factual matters, determination of \nissues related to class certification and the calculation of \ndamages or other relief, and addressing novel or unsettled \nlegal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in \nquestion.\nSignificant judgment is required in deciding when and if to \nmake these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or \nregulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different \nfrom the recorded accruals.\nSee Note 15  to the financial statements for additional \ninformation on legal contingencies.Income Taxes\nWe are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the \nU.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign \njurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. \nThese tax laws are complex and subject to different \ninterpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental \ntaxing authorities. We must make judgments and \ninterpretations about the application of these inherently \ncomplex tax laws when determining the provision for income \ntaxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make \nestimates about when certain items affect taxable income in \nthe various tax jurisdictions.\nDisputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled \nwith the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We \nperiodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each \ntaxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent \nyears\u2019 examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to \npotential losses that may arise from tax audits are established \nin accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Once \nestablished, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there \nis more information available or when an event occurs \nrequiring a change.\nOur provision for income taxes is composed of current and \ndeferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be \npaid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes \nreflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between \nthe financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities \nand are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and \nlaws that will be in effect when such differences are expected \nto reverse.\nOur deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets \nrelated to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating \nlosses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction \nof future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to \nexpiration if not utilized within certain periods. We perform \nregular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are \nrealizable.

The Required Liquidity Framework considers \nthe most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all \nregulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal \nentity level.\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nWe use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and \nintercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a \nrange of time horizons. These scenarios contain various \ncombinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of \ndifferent severity and duration. The methodology, \nimplementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity \nStress Tests are important components of the Required \nLiquidity Framework.\nThe assumptions used by us in our various Liquidity Stress \nTest scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022No government support;\n\u2022No access to equity and unsecured debt markets;\n\u2022Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress \nhorizon;\n\u2022Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of \nsecured funding;\n\u2022Additional collateral that would be required by trading \ncounterparties, certain exchanges and clearing \norganizations related to credit rating downgrades;\n\u2022Additional collateral that would be required due to \ncollateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled \ncollateral;\n\u2022Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;\n\u2022Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third \nparties; and\n\u2022Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short \npositions that fund long positions.\nLiquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at \ndifferent levels, including major operating subsidiaries and \nmajor currencies, to capture specific cash requirements and \ncash availability across the Firm, including a limited number \nof asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress \nTests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first \nto fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the \nParent Company and that the Parent Company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries\u2019 liquidity \nreserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning the \nLiquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement \nrisk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities \nand financing activities.\nAt December 31, 2020  and December 31, 2019 , \nwe maintained sufficient L iquidity  Resources  to meet current \nand contingent funding obligations as modeled in our \nLiquidity Stress Tests.\nLiquidity Resources\nWe maintain sufficient liquidity resources, which consist of \nHQLA and cash deposits with banks (\u201cLiquidity Resources\u201d) \nto cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity \ntargets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and \nLiquidity Stress Tests. The total amount of Liquidity \nResources is actively managed by us considering the \nfollowing components: unsecured debt maturity profile; \nbalance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a \nstressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; \nlegal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; \nregulatory requirements; and collateral requirements.\nThe amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our \nrisk tolerance and is subject to change depending on market \nand Firm-specific events. The Liquidity Resources are \nprimarily held within the Parent Company and its major \noperating subsidiaries.

as applicable.\nCredit risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the  \nStandardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily from an \nincrease in  Derivatives exposures driven by market volatility \nand an increase in Investment securities mainly as a result of \nthe E*TRADE acquisition . The increase was also driven by \nLending commitments within the Wealth Management and \nInstitutional Securities business segments and an increase in \nEquity investments due to  higher expos ure and market value \ngains.  In addition, c redit risk RWA under the Advanced \nApproach increased for CVA, mainly due to increased \nexposure in Derivatives and higher credit spread volatility.\nMarket risk RWA increased in 2020  under both the \nStandardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to an \nincrease in Regulatory VaR mainly as a result of higher \nmarket volatility.\nThe decrease in operational risk RWA under the Advanced \nApproach in 2020  reflects a decline in the frequency and \nseverity of litigation-related losses .G-SIB Capital Surcharge\nWe and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to a risk-based capital \nsurcharge. A G-SIB must calculate its G-SIB capital \nsurcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two \nsurcharges.

Large BHCs \nwere, however, authorized to make share repurchases relating \nto issuances of common stock related to employee stock \nownership plans; provided that a BHC did not increase the \namount of its common stock dividend s, to pay common stock \ndividends that did not exceed an amount equal to the average \nof the BHC\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar \nquarters, unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve; \nand to make scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier \n2 capital instruments. \nUnder the modified capital action restrictions announced on \nDecember 18, 2020, large BHCs are permitted, in the first \nquarter of 2021, to take certain capital actions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4403, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4f37cbc-97c4-463d-9444-8c5655c127a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4f37cbc-97c4-463d-9444-8c5655c127a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "110ffd46-3413-4066-ab7c-86a9b662313d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b6966cd4f904f59ed0b53e72abf288b38954cf709e5107e7a6d3233df993703a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f74e00fb-8e01-4a2b-8697-49189a6b16b8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b7837374b04f6a088006e5f38218c8e63d3b38207000e9ff65013b1f41909736", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3445bc23-824e-4f53-9b39-5cbde8ea58f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "630d28f3335dc2a0d5d54307f9429e8bba473bbe6535a545cc8b051a78b7ad9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1be95a0c9325909356b1a60a9a5568effda6abda1570647c73336b7c755630ae", "text": "Large BHCs \nwere, however, authorized to make share repurchases relating \nto issuances of common stock related to employee stock \nownership plans; provided that a BHC did not increase the \namount of its common stock dividend s, to pay common stock \ndividends that did not exceed an amount equal to the average \nof the BHC\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar \nquarters, unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve; \nand to make scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier \n2 capital instruments. \nUnder the modified capital action restrictions announced on \nDecember 18, 2020, large BHCs are permitted, in the first \nquarter of 2021, to take certain capital actions.

The stand-alone \nimpact of the change to the Required Capital framework was \nnot material to the business segments.

We will continue to evaluate the framework with \nrespect to the impact of other future regulatory requirements \nas appropriate. \nResolution and Recovery Planning\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to \nperiodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a \nresolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and \norderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the \nevent of our material financial distress or failure. Our next \nresolution plan submission will be a targeted resolution plan \nin July 2021.\nAs described in our most recent resolution plan, which was \nsubmitted on June 28, 2019, our preferred resolution strategy \nis an SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the \nParent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on \nan ongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly owned, direct \nsubsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the \u201cFunding \nIHC\u201d). In addition, the Parent Company has entered into an \namended and restated support agreement with its material \nentities (including the Funding IHC) and certain other \nsubsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent \nCompany would be obligated to contribute all of its \nContributable Assets to our material entities and/or the \nFunding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to \nprovide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material \nentities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution \nstrategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of \nTLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the \nholders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible \nTLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are \nimposed on creditors of our material entities or before putting \nU.S. taxpayers at risk .The obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC \nunder the amended and restated support agreement are in \nmost cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the \nParent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the \nParent Company and certain other assets)  and the a ssets of the \nFunding IHC. As a result, claims of our material entities, \nincluding the Funding IHC, with respect to the secured assets, \nare effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent \nCompany.\nIn December 2019, we received joint feedback on our 2019 \nresolution plan from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The \nfeedback confirmed that there are no deficiencies in our 2019 \nresolution plan and that we had successfully addressed a prior \nshortcoming identified by the agencies in the review of our \n2017 resolution plan.

We \nbelieve effective risk management is vital to the success of \nour business activities . Accordingly, we have an Enterprise \nRisk Management (\u201cERM\u201d) framework to integrate the \ndiverse roles of risk management into a holistic enterprise \nstructure and to facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment \ninto decision-making processes across the Firm.\nWe have policies and procedures in place to identify, \nmeasure, monitor, advise, challenge and control the principal \nrisks involved in the activities of the Institutional Securities, \nWealth Management and Investment Management business \nsegments, as well as at the Parent Company level. The \nprincipal risks involved in our business activities include \nmarket (including non-trading risks ), credit, operational, \nmodel, compliance, cybersecurity, liquidity, strategic, \nreputational and conduct risk . Strategic risk is integrated into \nour business planning, embedded in the evaluation of all \nprincipal risks and overseen by the Board.\nThe cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the \npursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk taking \nthat protects our capital base and franchise. This philosophy is \nimplemented through the ERM framework. Five key \nprinciples underlie this philosophy: integrity, \ncomprehensiveness, independence, accountability and \ntransparency. To help ensure the efficacy of risk management, \nwhich is an essential component of our reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication \nand the appropriate escalation of risk matters. The fast-paced, \ncomplex and constantly evolving nature of global financial \nmarkets requires us to maintain a risk management culture \nthat is incisive, knowledgeable about specialized products and \nmarkets, and subject to ongoing review and enhancement.\nOur risk appetite defines the types of risk that the Firm is \nwilling to accept in pursuit of our strategic objectives and \nbusiness plan, taking into account the interests of clients and \nfiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and other \nregulatory requirements. This risk appetite is embedded in our \nrisk culture and linked to our short-term and long-term \nstrategic, capital and financial plans, as well as compensation \nprograms. This risk appetite and the related Board-level risk \nlimits and risk tolerance statements are reviewed and \napproved by the Risk Committee of the Board (\u201cBRC\u201d) and \nthe Board on at least an annual basis.\nRisk  Governance Structure\nRisk management at the Firm  requires independent Firm-level \noversight, accountability of our business divisions, and \neffective communication of risk matters across the Firm, to \nsenior management and ultimately to the Board. Our risk \ngovernance structure is set forth in the following chart and \nalso includes risk managers, committees, and groups within \nand across business segments and operating legal entities. The \nERM f ramework, composed of independent but \ncomplementary entities, facilitates efficient and \ncomprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and \nprocess es.\nRRP\u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning\n1.Committees include the Capital Commitment Committee, Global Large Loan Committee, Equity Underwriting Committee, Leveraged Finance Underwriting Committee and \nMunicipal Capital Commitment Committee.\n2.Committees include the Securities Risk Committee, Wealth Management Risk Committee and Investment Management Risk Committee.Table of Contents\n61 December 2020 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3626, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87f40db8-89fa-4d37-87dc-fc1c58569280": {"__data__": {"id_": "87f40db8-89fa-4d37-87dc-fc1c58569280", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "096d0269-c68e-44fe-b063-46db24bfb6ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9a0d3045ce48cffb89349e59c69373e2658d2e95dd56995422039ae332dc4b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb79a1a6-8788-4cac-9c99-2927d3529a47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1e54d1d131e293da0b1604561eeaf054b14cb39de4a9218a54e595cc976d39a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "15d19e22-93a1-459c-bddb-7a1fdb695044", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "299dca98d5cf05771bc36fe8aa32d6dff02e21884da462a52cf4b78010e4ea94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "875d5e9fc5c99c2c6e110b4564d52bc0632def3dd9b056ab35d0a83f094ebfe6", "text": "Morgan Stanley Board of Directors\nThe Board has oversight of the ERM framework and is \nresponsible for helping to ensure that our risks are managed in \na sound manner.

Our risk-taking capacity is sized through the Firm\u2019s \ncapital planning process where losses are estimated under the \nFirm\u2019s BHC Severely Adverse stress testing scenario. We \nalso maintain a comprehensive suite of risk limits and \nquantitative metrics to support and implement our risk \nappetite statement. Our risk limits support linkages between \nthe overall risk appetite, which is reviewed by the Board, and \nmore granular risk-taking decisions and activities.\nRisk limits, once established, are reviewed and updated on at \nleast an annual basis, with more frequent updates as \nnecessary. Board-level risk limits address the most important \nFirmwide aggregations of risk, including, but not limited to, \nstressed market, credit and liquidity risks. Additional risk \nlimits approved by the FRC address more specific types of \nrisk and are bound by the higher-level Board risk limits.\nRisk Management Process\nIn subsequent sections, we discuss our risk management \npolicies and procedures for our primary risks. This discussion \nprimarily focuses on our Institutional Securities business \nsegment's trading activities and corporate lending  and related \nactivities. We believe that these activities generate a \nsubstantial portion of our primary risks. These sections and \nthe estimated amounts of our risk exposure generated by our \nstatistical analyses are forward-looking statements. However, \nthe analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of \nfuture events, and actual results may vary significantly from \nsuch analyses due to events in the markets in which we \noperate and certain other factors described in the following \nparagraphs.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one \nor more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, \ncorrelations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, \nwill result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we \nincur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client \nfacilitation activities, principally within the Institutional \nSecurities business segment where the substantial majority of \nour VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, \nwe incur non-trading market risk, principally within the \nWealth Management and Investment Management business \nsegments. The Wealth Management business segment \nprimarily incurs non-trading market risk (including interest \nrate risk) from lending and deposit-taking activities. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs \nnon-trading market risk from capital investments in \nalternative and other funds. \nMarket risk also includes non-trading interest rate risk. Non-\ntrading interest rate risk in the banking book (amounts \nclassified for regulatory capital purposes under the banking \nbook regime) refers to the exposure that a change in interest \nrates will result in prospective earnings changes for assets and \nliabilities in the banking book.\nSound market risk management is an integral part of our \nculture. The various business units and trading desks are \nresponsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-\nmanaged and prudent. The control groups help ensure that \nthese risks are measured and closely monitored and are made \ntransparent  to senior management. The Market Risk \nDepartment is responsible for ensuring the transparency of \nmaterial market risks, monitoring compliance with established \nlimits and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior \nmanagement.\nTo execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department \nmonitors our risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, \nperforms a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk \nsummaries, and maintains our VaR and scenario analysis \nsystems. Market risk is also monitored through various \nmeasures: by use of statistics (including VaR and related \nanalytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and \nthrough routine stress testing, which measures the impact on \nthe value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market \nfactors and scenarios designed by the Market Risk \nDepartment in collaboration with the business units.

Commodity exposures are subject to periods \nof high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and \ndemand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; \nphysical production and transportation; or geopolitical and \nother events that affect the available supply and level of \ndemand for these commodities.\nWe manage our trading positions by employing a variety of \nrisk mitigation strategies. These strategies include \ndiversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging \nactivities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related \nsecurities and financial instruments, including a variety of \nderivative products ( e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and \noptions). Hedging activities may not always provide effective \nmitigation against trading losses due to differences in the \nterms, specific characteristics or other basis risks that may \nexist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that \nis being hedged.\nWe manage the market risk associated with our trading \nactivities on a Firmwide basis, on a worldwide trading \ndivision level and on an individual product basis. We manage \nand monitor our market risk exposures in such a way as to \nmaintain a portfolio that we believe is well-diversified in the \naggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects \nour aggregate risk tolerance as established by our senior \nmanagement.\nAggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Firm \nacross all divisions worldwide.

Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, \ntraders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk \nmeasures against limits in accordance with policies set by our \nsenior management.Value-at-Risk\nThe statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we \nuse to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures \nof our trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department \ncalculates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to \nvarious levels of management.\nWe estimate VaR using a model based on a one-year equal \nweighted historical simulation for general market risk factors \nand name-specific risk in corporate shares and related \nderivatives , and Monte Carlo simulation for name-specific \nrisk in bonds, loans and related derivatives. The model \nconstructs a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the \nvalue of trading portfolios based on historical observation of \ndaily changes in key market indices or other market risk \nfactors, and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio \nvalues to these market risk factor changes.\nVaR for risk management purposes (\u201cManagement VaR\u201d) is \ncomputed at a 95% level of confidence over a one-day time \nhorizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading losses \nresulting from adverse daily market moves.

VaR is most \nappropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid \nfinancial markets and will understate the risk associated with \nsevere events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. We are \naware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use VaR \nas only one component in our risk management oversight \nprocess. This process also incorporates stress testing and \nscenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis and \ncontrol at the trading desk, division and Firm levels.\nOur VaR model evolves over time in response to changes in \nthe composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in \nmodeling techniques and systems capabilities. We are \ncommitted to continuous review and enhancement of VaR \nmethodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving \nrisks associated with changes in market structure and \ndynamics. As part of our regular process improvements, \nadditional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be \nadded to improve the VaR model\u2019s ability to more accurately \nestimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors.\nSince the reported VaR statistics are estimates based on \nhistorical data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of our \nfuture revenues or financial performance or of our ability to \nmonitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that our \nactual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR \namounts indicated in the following tables or that such losses \nwill not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a \n95%/one-day VaR. VaR does not predict the magnitude of \nlosses that, should they occur, may be significantly greater \nthan the VaR amount.\nVaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because \nof differences in the firms\u2019 portfolios, modeling assumptions \nand methodologies. These differences can result in materially \ndifferent VaR estimates across firms for similar portfolios. \nThe impact of such differences varies depending on the factor \nhistory assumptions, the frequency with which the factor \nhistory is updated and the confidence level. As a result, VaR \nstatistics are more useful when interpreted as indicators of \ntrends in a firm\u2019s risk profile rather than as an absolute \nmeasure of risk to be compared across firms.\nOur regulators have approved the same VaR model we use for \nrisk management purposes for use in regulatory calculations.\nThe portfolio of positions used for Management VaR differs \nfrom that used for Regulatory VaR.

The \nassets underlying client holdings are primarily composed of \nequity, fixed income and alternative investments, and are \nsensitive to changes in related markets. The overall level of \nthese revenues depends on multiple factors that include, but \nare not limited to, the level and duration of a market increase \nor decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of \nclient assets, and client behavior such as the rate and \nmagnitude of client investments and redemptions. Therefore, \noverall revenues do not correlate completely with changes in \nthe related markets.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, \ncounterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations \nto us. We are primarily exposed to credit risk from institutions \nand individuals through our Institutional Securities and \nWealth Management business segments. \nWe incur credit risk in our Institutional Securities business \nsegment through a variety of activities, including, but not \nlimited to, the following:\n\u2022extending credit to clients through loans and lending \ncommitments;\n\u2022entering into swap or other derivative contracts under \nwhich counterparties may have obligations to make \npayments to us;\n\u2022providing short- or long-term funding that is secured by \nphysical or financial collateral whose value may at times be \ninsufficient to fully cover the repayment amount;\n\u2022posting margin and/or collateral to clearinghouses, clearing \nagencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other \nfinancial counterparties;\n\u2022placing funds on deposit at other financial institutions to \nsupport our clearing and settlement obligations; and\n\u2022investing or trading in securities and loan pools, whereby \nthe value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or \nexpected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans.\nWe incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business \nsegment, primarily through lending to individuals and entities, \nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022margin loans collateralized by securities;\u2022securities-based lending and other forms of secured loans, \nincluding tailored lendi ng to hi gh and ultra-high net worth \nclients;\n\u2022single-family residential mortgage loans in conforming, \nnon-conforming or HELOC f orm primarily to existing \nWealth Management clients; and\n\u2022employee loans granted primarily to recruit certain Wealth \nManagement representatives.\nMonitoring and Control\nThe Credit Risk Management Department (\u201cCRM\u201d) \nestablishes Firmwide practices to evaluate, monitor and \ncontrol credit risk at the transaction, obligor and portfolio \nlevels. CRM approves extensions of credit, evaluates the \ncreditworthiness of the counterparties and borrowers on a \nregular basis, and helps ensure that credit exposure is actively \nmonitored and managed. The evaluation of counterparties and \nborrowers includes an assessment of the probability that an \nobligor will default on its financial obligations and any losses \nthat may occur when an obligor defaults. In addition, credit \nrisk exposure is actively managed by credit professionals and \ncommittees within CRM and through various risk committees, \nwhose membership includes individuals from CRM. A \ncomprehensive and global Credit Limits Framework is \nutilized to manage credit risk levels across the Firm. The \nCredit Limits Framework is calibrated within our risk \ntolerance and includes single-name limits and portfolio \nconcentration limits by country, industry and product type.\nCRM helps ensure timely and transparent communication of \nmaterial credit risks, compliance with established limits and \nescalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior \nmanagement. CRM also works closely with the Market Risk \nDepartment and applicable business units to monitor risk \nexposures and to perform stress tests to identify, analyze and \ncontrol credit risk concentrations arising from lending and \ntrading activities. The stress tests shock market factors ( e.g., \ninterest rates, commodity prices, credit spreads), risk \nparameters ( e.g., probabilit y of default  and loss given default), \nrecovery rates and expected losses in order to assess the \nimpact of stresses on exposures, profit and loss, and our \ncapital position.

Initial \nborrower requests for loan payment deferrals related to \nResidential real estate loans are granted , while those related to \nCommercial real estate loans require careful consideration \nprior to approval. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding  \nprincipal balance of  loans with approved deferrals of principal \nand interest payments currently in place which  are not \nclassified as troubled debt restructurings amounted to  \napproximately $400 million f or our Institutional Securities \nbusiness segment, primarily Commercial real estate loans , and \napproximately $400 million for our Wealth Management \nbusiness segment, primarily commercial real estate-related \ntailored loans within S ecurities -based lending and Other, and \nResidential real estate  loans . Incremental to this population, \nthroughout 2020, we have provided deferrals of principal and \ninterest on approximately $2.7 billion of loans which have \nnow exited such modification arrangements. The substantial \nmajority of these loans are current as of December 31, 2020.\nIn addition to these principal and interest deferrals, we are \nworking  with clients regarding modifications of certain other \nterms under their original loan agreements that do not impact \ncontractual loan payments. We have granted such relief to \ncertain borrowers, primarily within Secured lending facilities \nand Corporate loans. Such modifications include  agreements \nto modify margin calls for Secured lending facilities, typically \nin return for additional payments  that improve LTV ratios. In \nsome cases, we have agreed to temporarily not enforce cert ain \ncovenant s, for example debt or interest coverage ratios, \ntypically in return for other structural enhancements.\nGranting loan deferral or modification requests does not \nnecessarily mean that we will incur c redit losses , and we do \nnot believe modifications have had a material impact on the \nrisk profile of our loan portfolio. Modifications are considered \nin our evaluation of overall credit risk. Generally, loans with \npayment deferrals remain on accrual st atus, and loans with \nother modifications remain on current status.\nRequests for deferrals and other modifications could continue \nin future periods given the ongoing uncertain global economic \nand market conditions.

Risk factors considered in \ndetermining the aggregate allowance for loan and \ncommitment losses include the borrower\u2019s financial strength, \nindustry, facility structure, LTV ratio, debt service ratio, \ncollateral and covenants. Qualitative and environmental \nfactors such as economic and business conditions, nature and \nvolume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and \nseverity of past due loans may also be considered.\nThe aggregate allowance  for loans and lending commitment \nlosses increased  in 2020 , reflecting  the provision for credit \nlosses within the Institutional Securities business segment \nprincipally resulting from the continued economic impact of \nCOVID-19, partially offset by charge-offs . The provision was \nprimarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset \nquality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the \noutlook for the sectors in focus due to COVID-19.  Charge-\noffs in 2020 were primarily related to certain Commercial real \nestate and Corporate loans in the Institutional Securities \nbusiness segment.  The base scenario used in our ACL models \nas of December 31, 2020 was generated using a combination \nof industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and \ninternally developed and validated models. Given the nature \nof our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is \nU.S. gross domestic product. The base scenario, among other \nthings, assumes a continued recovery through 2021, supported \nby fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures.

securities-based lending and residential real \nestate loans.\nSecurities-based lending allows clients to borrow money \nagainst the value of qualifying securities, generally for any \npurpose other than purchasing , trading or carrying securities, \nor refinancing margin debt.  We establish approved credit lines \nagainst qualifying securities and monitor limits daily and, \npursuant to such guidelines, require customers to deposit \nadditional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when \nnecessary. These credit lines are primarily uncommitted loan \nfacilities, as we reserve the  right to not  make any advances or \nmay terminate these credit lines at any time. Factors \nconsidered in the review of these loans include, but are not \nlimited to, the loan amount, the client\u2019s credit profile, the \ndegree of leverage, collateral diversification, price volatility \nand liquidity of the collateral.\nResidential real estate loans consist of first and second lien \nmortgages, including HELOCs. Our underwriting policy is \ndesigned to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of \ncapacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis \nutilizing industry standard credit scoring models ( e.g., FICO \nscores), debt-to-income ratios and assets of the borrower. \nLTV ratios are determined based on independent third-party \nproperty appraisals and valuations, and security lien positions \nare established through title and ownership reports. The vast \nmajority of mortgage loans, including HELOCs, are held for \ninvestment in the Wealth Management business segment\u2019s \nloan portfolio.\nIn 2020 , Loans and Lending commitments associated with the \nWealth Management business segment increased, driven by \nsecurities-based loans  and residential real estate loans.Wealth Management Allowance for Credit Losses\u2014Loans and \nLending Commitments\n$ in millions\nDecember 31, 20191$ 57 \nEffect of CECL adoption  17 \nGross charge-offs  (2) \nProvision2 29 \nDecember 31, 2020 $ 101 \nACL\u2014Loans $ 96 \nACL\u2014Lending commitments  5 \n1.At December 31, 2019, the ACL for Loans and Lending commitments was $52 \nmillion and $5 million, respectively.\n2.In 2020  the provision for loan losses was $30 million  and the release for losses on \nlendi ng commitments was $1 million.\nAt December 31, 2020 , more than 75% of Wealth \nManagement residential real estate loans were to borrowers \nwith \u201cExceptional\u201d or \u201cVery Good\u201d FICO scores ( i.e., \nexceeding 740).

For a description of our \nrisk mitigation strategies, see \u201c Credit Risk\u2014Risk Mitigation \u201d \nherein. In  2020 , our exposure to credit risk arising from OTC \nderivatives has increased, primarily as a function of the effect \nof market factors and volatility on the valuation of our \npositions, although exposure has declined since peaking in \nMarch 2020.\nCredit Derivatives\nA credit derivative is a contract between a seller and buyer of \nprotection against the risk of a credit event occurring on one \nor more debt obligations issued by a specified reference \nentity. The buyer typically pays a periodic premium over the \nlife of the contract and is protected for the period. If a credit \nevent occurs, the seller is required to make payment to the \nbeneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivative \ncontract. Credit events, as defined in the contract, may be one \nor more of the following defined events: bankruptcy, \ndissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to \npay, obligation acceleration, repudiation, payment \nmoratorium and restructuring.\nWe trade in a variety of credit derivatives and may either \npurchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio of \nreferenced entities. In transactions referencing a portfolio of \nentities or securities, protection may be limited to a tranche of \nexposure or a single name within the portfolio. We are an \nactive market maker in the credit derivatives markets. As a \nmarket maker, we work to earn a bid-offer spread on client \nflow business and manage any residual credit or correlation \nrisk on a portfolio basis. Further, we use credit derivatives to \nmanage our exposure to residential and commercial mortgage \nloans and corporate lending exposures.

A majority of our counterparties are \ncomposed of banks, broker-dealers, insurance and other \nfinancial institutions. Contracts with these counterparties may \ninclude provisions related to counterparty rating downgrades, \nwhich may result in the counterparty posting additional \ncollateral to us.

We actively manage country risk \nexposure through a comprehensive risk management \nframework that combines credit and market fundamentals and \nallows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country \nrisk.\nOur obligor credit evaluation process may also identify \nindirect exposures, whereby an obligor has vulnerability or \nexposure to another country or jurisdiction. Examples of \nindirect exposures include mutual funds that invest in a single \ncountry, offshore companies whose assets reside in another \ncountry to that of the offshore jurisdiction and finance \ncompany subsidiaries of corporations. Indirect exposures \nidentified through the credit evaluation process may result in \na reclassification of country risk.\nWe conduct periodic stress testing that seeks to measure the \nimpact on our credit and market exposures of shocks \nstemming from negative economic or political \nscenarios. When deemed appropriate by our risk managers, \nthe stress test scenarios include possible contagion effects and \nsecond order risks. This analysis, and results of the stress \ntests, may result in the amendment of limits or exposure \nmitigation.\nOur sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and \nobligations entered into with sovereign and local \ngovernments.

We may incur operational risk \nacross the full scope of our business activities, including \nrevenue-generating activities ( e.g., sales and trading) and \nsupport and control groups ( e.g., information technology and \ntrade processing).\nWe have established an operational risk framework to \nidentify, measure, monitor and control risk across the Firm. \nEffective operational risk management is essential to reducing \nthe impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, \nregulatory and reputational risks. The framework is \ncontinually evolving to account for changes in the Firm and to \nrespond to the changing regulatory and business environment.\nWe have implemented operational risk data and assessment \nsystems to monitor and analyze internal and external \noperational risk events, to assess business environment and \ninternal control factors, and to perform scenario analysis. The \ncollected data elements are incorporated in the operational \nrisk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative \nand qualitative elements.

Operational risks and \nassociated risk exposures are assessed relative to the risk \ntolerance reviewed and confirmed by the Board and are \nprioritized accordingly.\nThe breadth and range of operational risk are such that the \ntypes of mitigating activities are wide-ranging. Examples of \nactivities include: continuous enhancement of defenses \nagainst cyber attacks; use of legal agreements and contracts to \ntransfer and/or limit operational risk exposures; due diligence; \nimplementation of enhanced policies and procedures; \ntechnology change management controls; exception \nmanagement processing controls; and segregation of duties.\nPrimary responsibility for the management of operational risk \nis with the business segments, the control groups and the \nbusiness managers therein. The business managers maintain \nprocesses and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, \nmitigate and report operational risk. Each of the business \nsegments has a designated operational risk coordinator. The \noperational risk coordinator regularly reviews operational risk \nissues and reports to our senior management within each \nbusiness. Each control group also has a designated operational \nrisk coordinator and a forum for discussing operational risk \nmatters with our senior management.

The \nrisk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, \ncomplexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions.\nModel risk is generated from the use of models impacting \nfinancial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy \nassessments and the formulation of strategy.\nSound model risk management is an integral part of our Risk \nManagement Framework. The Model Risk Management \nDepartment (\u201cMRM\u201d) is a distinct department in Risk \nManagement responsible for the oversight of model risk.\nMRM establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our risk \nappetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the \nmateriality of the risk of financial loss or reputational damage \ndue to errors in design, implementation and/or inappropriate \nuse of models. The tolerance is monitored through model-\nspecific and aggregate business-level assessments, which are \nbased upon qualitative and quantitative factors.\nA guiding principle for managing model risk is the \u201ceffective \nchallenge\u201d of models. The effective challenge of models is \ndefined as critical analysis by objective, informed parties who \ncan identify model limitations and assumptions and drive \nappropriate changes. MRM provid es effective challenge of \nmodels, independently validates and approves models for use, \nannually recertifies models, identifies and tracks remediation \nplans for model l imitations and  reports on model risk metrics. \nThe department also oversees the development of controls to \nsupport a complete and accurate Firmwide model inventory.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to \nfinance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital \nmarkets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk \nalso encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our \nfinancial obligations without experiencing significant \nbusiness disruption or reputational damage that may threaten \nour viability as a going concern.  Liquidity risk also \nencompasses the associated funding risks triggered by the \nmarket or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively \naffect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new \nfunding. Generally, we incur liquidity and funding risk as a \nresult of our trading, lending, investing and client facilitation \nactivities.\nOur Liquidity Risk Management Framework is critical to \nhelping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves \nand durable funding sources to meet our daily obligations and \nto withstand unanticipated stress events. The Liquidity Risk \nDepartment is a distinct area in Risk Management responsible \nfor the oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk. The Liquidity Risk Department ensures transparency of material \nliquidity and funding risks, compliance with established risk \nlimits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate \nsenior management.\nTo execute these responsibilities, the Liquidity Risk \nDepartment establishes limits in line with our risk appetite, \nidentifies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to \nensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and \nreports risk exposures against metrics and limits, and reviews \nthe methodologies and assumptions underpinning our \nLiquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and \nfunding under a range of adverse scenarios. \nThe Treasury Department and applicable business units have \nprimary responsibility for evaluating, monitoring and \ncontrolling the liquidity and funding risks arising from our \nbusiness activities and for maintaining processes and controls \nto manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. The \nLiquidity Risk Department coordinates with the Treasury \nDepartment and these business units to help ensure a \nconsistent and comprehensive framework for managing \nliquidity and funding risk across the Firm.

The Firm \naccounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of \naccounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the \npurchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and \nliabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, \nincluding identified intangibles of approximately $3.3 billion. \nOf the identified intangible assets acquired, the most \nsignificant were the customer relationship intangible assets of \n$2.8 billion. Management, with the assistance of a valuation \nspecialist, estimated the fair value of customer relationship \nintangible assets using the income approach, which \ndetermines the fair value as the present value of forecasted future cash flows. The determination of fair value of the \nassets involves significant estimates and assumptions related \nto forecasted future cash flows and the selection of the \nrespective discount rate.\nWe identified the valuation of customer relationship \nintangible assets as a critical audit matter because the fair \nvalue determination requires management to make significant \nestimates and assumptions in determining the forecasted \nfuture cash flows including revenue growth rates and attrition \nrates as well as the selection of the discount rate. Performing \naudit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these \nestimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor \njudgment and an increased extent of effort, including the \ninvolvement of our valuation specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation of customer \nrelationship intangible assets acquired as part of the \nE*TRADE acquisition included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls \nover the valuation methodology used, the determination of \nforecasted future cash flows, and the selection of the \ndiscount rate.\n\u2022We assessed the knowledge, skill, ability and objectivity of \nmanagement\u2019s valuation specialist and evaluated the work \nperformed.\n\u2022We evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation \nmethodology used and the reasonableness of the forecasted \nfuture cash flows for each selected customer relationship \nintangible asset, specifically the assumptions relating to \nrevenue growth and attrition rates, as well as whether the \nassumptions used were reasonable considering external \nmarket and industry data as well as the past performance of \nE*TRADE. We also performed sensitivity analyses to \nevaluate the impact of changes in assumptions to the \nvaluation of the customer relationship intangible assets.\n\u2022We tested the source information underlying the \ndetermination of the discount rates and attrition rates and \nalso tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.\n\u2022We developed a range of independent estimates of

Individual \nclients are generally served through intermediaries, \nincluding affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.\nBasis of Financial Information\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. \nGAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and \nassumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial \ninstruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, \nthe outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, \nACL, and other matters that affect its financial statements and \nrelated disclosures. The Firm believes that the estimates \nutilized in the preparation of its financial statements are \nprudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially \nfrom these estimates.  \nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to \nconform to the current presentation. The Notes are an integral \npart of the Firm's financial statements.

Intercompany balances and transactions \nhave been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are \nnot wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests \nare referred to as Noncontrolling interests. The net income \nattributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is \npresented as Net income applicable to noncontrolling interests \nin the income statements. The portion of shareholders\u2019 equity \nthat is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such \nsubsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a \ncomponent of Total equity, in the balance sheets.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4966, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a15463de-5111-475d-ab72-94db803da4a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "a15463de-5111-475d-ab72-94db803da4a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e47841f3-6d7e-48a3-a46b-2f05a4f3ec25", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8f60adfacece7eda5c4d5634024fe9e300eaf7b36186a338e12df6c2e13f80bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "58f69b2b-81cf-42f8-851b-f7beac68c221", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ee23b3aac1f2082b3a29b08e9350b87dd6e0e96fe00223e771bb171276c47704", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a300d41-4a6c-488d-90f2-f5e69b3c2a73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee81ae6b7db2e78e7ea7a1e4e78574e9e20c0e8393f87a822e04b11ed1e09de7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "375dde2044a1e3b3e02566ba46d132de9ad4226f8115e71f94da05dd6585e4d2", "text": "Consolidation\nThe financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its \nwholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the \nFirm has a controlling financial interest, including certain \nVIEs (see  Note 16 ).

Significant Accounting Policies  \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when the promised goods or \nservices are delivered to our custome rs, in an amount that is \nbased on the consideration the Firm expects to receive in \nexchange for those goods or services when such amounts are \nnot probable of significant reversal. \nInvestment Banking\nRevenues from investment banking activities consist of \nrevenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and \nfixed income securities and loan syndications, and advisory \nfees, primarily for mergers, acquisitions and restructurings. \nUnderwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date \nif there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount \nto be paid. Underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in \nthe relevant non-interest expenses line ite ms wh en the related \nunderwriting revenues are recorded.\nAdvisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the \nclient, based on the estimated progress of work and when \nrevenues are not probable of a significant reversal. Advisory \ncosts are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest \nexpenses line items, including those reimbursed.\nCommissions and Fees\nCommission and fee revenues generally result from \ntransaction-based arrangements in which the client is charged \na fee  for the execution of transactions.  Such revenues primarily arise from transactions in equity securities; services \nrelated to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual \nfunds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and \noptions , as well as revenues from order flow payments for \ndirecting customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges, and \nmarket centers for execution. Commission and fee revenues \nare recognized on trade date when the performance obligation \nis satisfied.\nAsset Management Revenues\nAsset management, distribution and administration fees are \ngenerally based on related asset levels being managed, such as \nthe AUM of a customer\u2019s account or the net asset value of a \nfund. These fees are generally recognized when services are \nperformed and the fees become known. Management fees are \nreduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, \nprovided to the customer.\nPerformance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are \nrecorded when the annual performance target is met and the \nrevenues are not probable of a significant reversal.\nSales commissions paid by the Firm in connection with the \nsale of certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund \nproducts are accounted for as deferred commission assets and \namortized to expense over the expected life of the contract. \nThe Firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for \nrecoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in \nfuture periods.

Therefore, even when market assumptions \nare not readily available, assumptions are set to reflect those \nthat the Firm believes market participants would use in \npricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Where \nthe Firm manages a group of financial assets, financial \nliabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted for as derivatives \non the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit \nrisk, the Firm measures the fair value of that group of \nfinancial instruments consistently with how market \nparticipants would price the net risk exposure at the \nmeasurement date.\nIn determining fair value, the Firm uses various valuation \napproaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in \nmeasuring fair value that requires the most observable inputs \nbe used when available.\nObservable inputs are inputs that market participants would \nuse in pricing the asset or liability that were developed based \non market data obtained from sources independent of the \nFirm. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions \nthe Firm believes other market participants would use in \npricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the \nbest information available in the circumstances.

To the extent \nthat valuation is based on models or inputs that are less \nobservable or unobservable in the market, the determination \nof fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree \nof judgment exercised by the Firm in determining fair value is \ngreatest for instruments categorized in Level 3 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy.\nThe Firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the \nmeasurement date, including during periods of market \ndislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability \nof prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. \nThis condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified \nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair \nvalue hierarchy.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall \ninto different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, \nthe total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate \nfor the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair \nvalue of the asset or liability.\nValuation Techniques\nMany cash instruments and OTC derivative contracts have bid \nand ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid \nprices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for \nan asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is \nwilling to accept for an asset. The Firm carries positions at the \npoint within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of \nfair value. For offsetting positions in the same financial \ninstrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to \nmeasure both the long and short positions.\nFair value for many cash instruments and OTC derivative \ncontracts is derived using pricing models. Pricing models take \ninto account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, \nincluding, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, \ninterest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, \ncreditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the \nFirm, option volatility and currency rates.\nWhere appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account \nfor various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask \nadjustments), credit quality, model uncertain ty and \nconcentration risk and funding. Adjustments for liquidity risk \nadjust model-derived mid-market amounts of Level 2 and \nLevel 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid or mid-ask \nspread required to properly reflect the exit price of a risk \nposition. Bid-mid and mid-ask spreads are marked to levels \nobserved in trade activity, broker quotes or other external \nthird-party data. Where these spreads are unobservable for the \nparticular position in question, spreads are derived from \nobservable levels of similar positions.\nThe Firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its \nBorrowings for which the fair value option was elected and to OTC derivatives. The Firm considers the impact of changes in \nits own credit spreads based upon observations of the \nsecondary bond market spreads when measuring the fair value \nfor Borrowings.\nFor OTC derivatives, the impact of changes in both the Firm\u2019s \nand the counterparty\u2019s credit rating is considered when \nmeasuring fair value. In determining the expected exposure, \nthe Firm simulates the distribution of the future exposure to a \ncounterparty, then applies market-based default probabilities \nto the future exposure, leveraging external third-party CDS \nspread data.

These agreements provide \nthe Firm with the right, in the event of a default by the \ncounterparty, to net a counterparty\u2019s rights and obligations \nunder the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash \ncollateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty. \nDerivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are \nreported net of cash collateral received and posted.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, the Firm may not have \nsuch an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime \nmay not support the enforceability of the master netting \nagreement or collateral agreement; or the Firm may not have \nsought legal advice to support the enforceability of the \nagreement. In cases where the Firm has not determined an \nagreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not \noffset (see Note 7 ).\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is generally to receive cash and /or \nsecurities  posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), \nirrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the \nmaster netting and collateral agreement. In certain cases, the \nFirm may agree for such collateral to be posted to a third-\nparty custodian under a control agreement that enables it to \ntake control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty \ndefault. The enforceability of the master netting agreement is \ntaken into account in the Firm\u2019s risk management practices \nand application of counterparty credit limits.\nFor information related to offsetting of derivatives, see Note \n7.\nHedge Accounting\nThe Firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative \nfinancial instruments for the following types of hedges: \nhedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due \nto the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net \ninvestments in foreign operations whose functional currency \nis different from the reporting currency of the Parent \nCompany (net investment hedges). These financial \ninstruments are included within Trading assets\u2014Derivative \nand other contracts or Trading liabilities\u2014Derivative and \nother contracts in the balance sheets. For hedges where hedge \naccounting is being applied, the Firm performs effectiveness \ntesting and other procedures.Fair Value Hedges\u2014Interest Rate Risk\nThe Firm\u2019s designated fair value hedges consist of interest \nrate swaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark \ninterest rate of certain fixed rate AFS securities and senior \nborrowings. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Firm also began \ndesignating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes \nin the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits. \nThe Firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the, \ncontractual term of the hedged instrument. The Firm uses \nregression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and \nretrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging \nrelationships. A hedging relationship is deemed effective if \nthe change in fair value of the hedging instrument (derivative) \nand the change in fair value of the hedged item (AFS security, \ndeposit liability or borrowing), due to changes in the \nbenchmark interest rate, offset within a range of 80% to \n125% . The Firm considers the impact of valuation \nadjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and its own \ncredit spreads to determine whether they would cause the \nhedging relationship to be ineffective.\nFor qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, \nthe change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the \nchange in the fair value attributable to the change in the \nbenchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is \nrecognized in earnings each period as a component of Interest \nincome (expense). For AFS securities, the change in fair value \nof the hedged item due to changes other than the risk being \nhedged will continue to be reported in OCI. When a \nderivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment \nremaining on the hedged asset (liability) is amortized to \nInterest income (expense) over the remaining life of the asset \n(liability) using the effective interest method.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage \na portion of the currency exposure relating to its net \ninvestments in foreign operations.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4787, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43036276-6489-48cb-862a-78b470568e20": {"__data__": {"id_": "43036276-6489-48cb-862a-78b470568e20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "caec97f7-e773-461c-b3b2-afe01972fe9f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "54f0672fd14d180bb2e53df54b742f264e5f059de654b3f0d92b72b291ebca7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd8d364d-dc9e-4dce-8858-edcb3eb80c63", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f4f6acbe89ec9bc139515a8f3fa57512c87179c76de5d2bd5226ee6de2cb407c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "39b6cc3b-f84a-4ec6-87d0-77a765dbe12b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "695a893afe15e0bbcf788b7705d080cb82a69d12af35849cc4f8239fe884ae77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c22309c3d1505cc3988d6338dbeb186fbaa033602350c56a6c4695d04cf28161", "text": "For qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, \nthe change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the \nchange in the fair value attributable to the change in the \nbenchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is \nrecognized in earnings each period as a component of Interest \nincome (expense).

Factors considered by management when determining the \nACL include payment status, fair value of collateral and \nexpected payments of principal and interest, as well as \ninternal or external information relating to past events, current \nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The \nFirm  uses three forecasts that  include  assumptions about \ncertain macroeconomic variables including, but not limited to, \nU.S. gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d), equity market indices \nand unemployment rates, as well as commercial real estate \nand home price indices. At the conclusion of the Firm\u2019s \nreasonable and supportable forecast period of 13 quarters, \nthere is a gradual reversion back to historical averages.\nThe ACL is measured on a collective basis when similar risk \ncharacteristics exist for multiple instruments considering all \navailable information relevant to assessing the collectability  \nof cash flows. Generally, the Firm applies a probability of \ndefault/loss given default model for instruments that are \ncollectively assessed, under which the ACL is calculated as \nthe product of probability of default, loss given default and \nexposure at default. These parameters are forecast for each \ncollective group of assets using a scenario-based statistical \nmodel .\nIf the instrument does not share similar risk characteristics \nwith other instruments, including when it is probable that the \nFirm will be unable to collect the full payment of principal \nand interest on the instrument when due, the ACL is measured \non an individual basis. The Firm generally applies a \ndiscounted cash flow method for instruments that are \nindividually assessed.\nThe Firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the \nfair value of the collateral when measuring the ACL if the \nloan is collateral dependent ( i.e., repayment of the loan is \nexpected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation \nof the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing \nfinancial difficulty).\nAdditionally, the Firm can elect to use an approach to \nmeasure the ACL using the fair value of collateral where the \nborrower is required to, and reasonably expected to, \ncontinually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral \nsecuring the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of \nsuch collateral.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4902, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7546f9cc-90d9-4531-8e4b-62420998342a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7546f9cc-90d9-4531-8e4b-62420998342a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f17505b2-09b9-4728-9f04-766743529621", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f97821e2b1a86b5de4d13b01d2b5781716845ca5817a9340f50338a4f05828fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02adbfd5-8e16-467f-888e-b2e5d659fb6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0e1fbdd64166c8d2a618530b32d6b738fcc65ae2358c314b291074c7c210f999", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f61ff928-1da3-4fc4-9897-8edaa0c6dc64", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e25bd19a8f6ab7072e702fc9bc83cc9e7e3bb8ee4041344b9735124a242714af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0bd7f32e44f763debbca640c80397ddc6e54517be4fc42af79ea20c9df587eda", "text": "The Firm generally applies a \ndiscounted cash flow method for instruments that are \nindividually assessed.\nThe Firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the \nfair value of the collateral when measuring the ACL if the \nloan is collateral dependent ( i.e., repayment of the loan is \nexpected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation \nof the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing \nfinancial difficulty).\nAdditionally, the Firm can elect to use an approach to \nmeasure the ACL using the fair value of collateral where the \nborrower is required to, and reasonably expected to, \ncontinually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral \nsecuring the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of \nsuch collateral.

A loan that has been \nmodified in a TDR is generally considered to be impaired and \nis evaluated individually.

For \nborrowers impacted by COVID-19, see \u201cModifications and \nNonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19\u201d \nherein for additional considerations. \nFor any instrument  placed on nonaccrual status, the Firm \nreverses any unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting \nreduction to Interest income. Principal and interest payments \nreceived on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if \nthere is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of \nprincipal. If collection of the principal is not in doubt, interest \nincome is realized on a cash basis.

Diluted EPS reflects \nthe assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.\nShare-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to \nvesting are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive) \nunder the treasury stock method.\nThe Firm has granted PSUs that vest and convert to shares of \ncommon stock only if predetermined performance and market \ngoals are satisfied.

The Firm determines the fair value of \nRSUs (including PSUs with non-market performance \nconditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common \nstock, measured as the volume-weighted average price on the \ndate of grant (\u201cVWAP\u201d). The fair value of RSUs not entitled \nto dividends until conversion is measured at VWAP reduced \nby the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the \nunderlying shares prior to scheduled conversion date. PSUs \nthat contain market-based conditions are valued using a \nMonte Carlo valuation model.\nCompensation expense is recognized over the  vesting period \nrelevant to each separately vesting portion of the award. \nCompensation expense for awards with performance \nconditions is recognized based on the probable outcome of the \nperformance condition at each reporting date. Compensation \nexpense for awards with market-based conditions is \nrecognized irrespective of the probability of the market \ncondition being achieved and is not reversed if the market \ncondition is not met. The Firm accounts for forfeitures as they \noccur.\nStock-based awards generally contain claw back and \ncancellation provisions. Certain awards provide the Firm \ndiscretion to claw back or cancel all or a portion of the award \nunder specified circumstances. Compensation expense for \nthose awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the \nFirm\u2019s common stock or the relevant model valuation, as \nappropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration.\nEmployee Stock Trusts\nIn connection with certain stock-based compensation plans, \nthe Firm has established employee stock trusts to provide, at \nits discretion, common stock voting rights  to certain  RSU \nholders. Following an RSU award, when a stock trust is \nutilized, the Firm contributes shares to be held in the stock trust until the RSUs convert to common shares.  The assets of \nthe employee stock trusts are consolidated with those of the \nFirm and are generally accounted for in a manner similar to \ntreasury stock, where the shares of common stock outstanding \nreported in Common stock issued to employee stock trusts are \noffset by an equal amount reported in Employee stock trusts \nin the balance sheets.\nThe Firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based \ncompensation as the basis for recording the movement of the \nassets to or from the employee stock trusts. Changes in the \nfair value are not recognized as the Firm\u2019s stock-based \ncompensation must be settled by delivery of a fixed number \nof shares of the Firm\u2019s common stock.\nDeferred Cash-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation \nawards is calculated based on the notional value of the award \ngranted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the \nreferenced investments that employees select.

The effect of a change in tax rates on \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax \nexpense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment \ndate. Such effects are recorded in income tax expense \n(benefit) from continuing operations regardless of where \ndeferred taxes were originally recorded.\nThe Firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that \nit believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. \nIn making such a determination, the Firm considers all \navailable positive and negative evidence, including future \nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected \nfuture taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of \nrecent operations. When performing the assessment, the Firm \nconsiders all types of deferred tax assets in combination with \neach other, regardless of the origin of the underlying \ntemporary difference. If a deferred tax asset is determined to \nbe unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. If the \nFirm subsequently determines that it would be able to realize \ndeferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, it \nwould make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation \nallowance, which would reduce the provision for income \ntaxes.\nThe Firm recognizes tax expense associated with Global \nIntangible Low-Taxed Income as it i s incurred as part of the \ncurrent income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current \nperiod.\nUncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step \nprocess, whereby (i) the Firm determines whether it is more \nlikely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the \nbasis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those \ntax positions that meet this threshold, the Firm recognizes the \nlargest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be \nrealized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax \nauthority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax \nbenefits are recognized as a component of the provision for \nincome taxes.\nForeign Currencies\nAssets and liabilities of operations with non-U.S. dollar \nfunctional currencies are translated at year-end rates of \nexchange. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign \ncurrency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and \nrelated tax effects, are reflected in AOCI in the balance \nsheets. Gains or losses resulting from remeasurement of \nforeign currency transactions are included in net income, and \namounts recognized in the income statement are translated at \nthe rate of exchange on the respective date of recognition for \neach amount.Accounting Updates Adopted in 20 20\nReference Rate Reform\nThe Firm has adopted the Reference Rate Reform accounting \nupdate. There was no impact to the Firm\u2019s financial \nstatements upon initial adoption. \nThis accounting update provides optional accounting relief to \nentities with contracts, hedge accounting relationships or \nother transactions that reference LIBOR or other interest rate \nbenchmarks for which the referenced rate is expected to be \ndiscontinued or replaced. The Firm is applying the accounting \nrelief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship \nmodifications are made during the course of the reference rate \nreform transition period. The optional relief generally allows \nfor contract modifications solely related to the replacement of \nthe reference rate to be accounted for as a continuation of the \nexisting contract instead of as an extinguishment of the \ncontr act and would therefore not trigger certain accounting \nimpacts that would otherwise be required. It also allows \nentities to change certain critical terms of existing hedge \naccounting relationships that are affected by reference rate \nreform, and these changes would not require de-designating \nthe hedge accounting relationship. The optional relief ends \nDecember 31, 2022.\nFinancial Instruments \u2014Credit  Losses\nThe Firm has adopted the Financial Instruments\u2014Credit \nLosses. \nThis accounting update impacted the impairment model for \ncertain financial assets measured at amortized cost by \nrequiring a CECL methodology to estimate expected credit \nlosses over the entire life of the financial asset, recorded at \ninception or purchase.

The \nadoption resulted in an increase to Retained earnings of \napproximately $63 million , net of tax, related to deferred \nrevenue from previously recorded sale-leaseback transactions. \nAt transition on January 1, 2019, the adoption also resulted in \na balance sheet gross-up of approximately $4 billion  reflected \nin Other assets and Other liabilities and accrued expenses. See \nNote 10 for lease disclosures, including amounts reflected in \nthe December 31, 2019 balance sheet. Prior period amounts \nwere not restated.\nAs allowed by the guidance, the Firm elected not to reassess \nthe following at transition: whether existing contracts are or \ncontain leases; and for existing leases, lease classification and \ninitial direct costs. In addition, the Firm continues to account \nfor existing land easements as service contracts.\nBoth at transition and for new leases thereafter, ROU assets \nand lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the \npresent value of the future minimum lease payments over the \nlease term, including non-lease components such as fixed \ncommon area maintenance costs and other fixed costs such as \nreal estate taxes and insurance.\nThe discount rates used in determining the present value of \nleases are the Firm\u2019s incremental borrowing rates, developed \nbased upon each lease\u2019s term and currency of payment. The \nlease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease \nwhen it is reasonably certain that the Firm will exercise that \noption. For operating leases, the ROU assets also include any \nprepaid lease payments and initial direct costs incurred and \nare reduced by lease incentives. For these leases, lease \nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease \nterm if the ROU asset has not been impaired or abandoned.\nDerivatives and Hedging (ASU 2018-16)\nThe amendments in this update permit use of the OIS rate \nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S. \nbenchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. The \nFirm adopted this update on a prospective basis for qualifying \nnew or redesignated hedging relationships. This update did \nnot impact the Firm\u2019s pre-existing hedges.\n3. Acquisitions\nAcquisition of E* TRADE\nOn October 2, 2020 , the Firm completed the acquisition of \n100%  of E*TRADE Financial Corporation (\u201cE*TRADE\u201d) in \na stock-for-stock transaction, which increase s the scale and \nbreadth of the Wealth Management business segment. Total \nconsideration for the transaction was approximately  $11.9 billion , which principally consists of the $11 billion  fair value \nof 233 million  common shares issued from Common stock \nheld in treasury, at an exchange ratio of 1.0432  per \nE*TRADE common share. In addition, the Firm issued Series \nM and Series N preferred shares with a fair value of \napproximately $0.7 billion  in exchange for E*TRADE\u2019s \nexisting preferred stock.\nUpon acquisition , the assets and liabilities of E*TRADE were \nadjusted to their respective fair values as of the closing date of \nthe transaction, including the identifiable intangible assets \nacquired.

Many pricing models do not entail material \nsubjectivity as the methodologies employed do not \nnecessitate significant judgment since  model inputs may \nbe observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case \nfor generic interest rate swaps, many  equity, commodity \nand foreign currency option contracts, and certain CDS. In \nthe case of more established derivative products, the \npricing models used by the Firm are widely accepted by \nthe financial services industry. \n\u2022More complex OTC  derivative products  are typically less \nliquid and require  more  judgment  in the implementation of \nthe valuation technique since direct trading activity or \nquotes are unobservable. This includes certain types of \ninterest rate derivatives with both volatility and correlation \nexposure, equity, commodity or foreign currency \nderivatives that are either longer-dated or include exposure \nto multiple underlyings, and credit derivatives, including \nCDS on certain mortgage- or asset-backed securities and \nbasket CDS. Where required inputs are unobservable, \nrelationships to observable data points, based on historical \nand/or implied observations, may be employed as a \ntechnique to estimate the model input values.

These investments are included in the Fund \nInterests table in the \"Net Asset Value Measurements\" \nsection herein. \u2022For non-exchange-traded investments either held directly \nor held within internally managed funds, fair value after \ninitial recognition is based on an assessment of each \nunderlying investment, considering rounds of financing \nand third-party transactions, discounted cash flow analyses \nand market-based information, including comparable Firm \ntransactions, trading multiples and changes in market \noutlook, among other factors. \nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\u2022Level 1\u2014if actively traded\n\u2022Level 2\u2014when not actively traded and valued based on \nrounds of financing or third-party transactions\n\u2022Level 3\u2014when not actively traded and rounds of \nfinancing or third-party transactions are not available \nPhysical Commodities\nValuation Techniques:\n\u2022The Firm trades various physical commodities, including \nnatural gas and precious metals. \n\u2022Fair value is determined using observable inputs, \nincluding broker quotations and published indices. \nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\u2022Level 2 \u2014valued  using observable inputs\nInvestment Securities\u2014AFS Securities\nValuation Techniques:\n\u2022AFS securities are composed of U.S. government and \nagency securities ( e.g., U.S. Treasury securities, agency-\nissued debt, agency mortgage pass-through securities and \nCMOs), CMBS, ABS, state and municipal securities, and \ncorporate bonds.

For margin loans, the margin loan rate is \nthe annualized rate that reflects the possibility of losses as a \nresult of movements in the price of the underlying margin \nloan collateral. The rate is calibrated from the previously \ndisclosed discount rate, credit spread and/or volatility \nmeasures.\nAn increase (decrease) to the following significant \nunobservable inputs would generally result in a higher (lower) \nfair value.\n\u2022Comparable bond or loan price: A pricing input used when \nprices for the identical instrument are not available. \nSignificant subjectivity may be involved when fair value is \ndetermined using pricing data available for comparable \ninstruments. Valuation using comparable instruments can \nbe done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a \nliquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond or \nloan, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value \nfor the bond or loan. The adjustment to yield (or spread) \nshould account for relevant differences in the bonds or \nloans such as maturity or credit quality. Alternatively, a \nprice-to-price basis can be assumed between the \ncomparable instrument and the bond or loan being valued in \norder to establish the value of the bond or loan.\n\u2022Comparable equity price:  A price derived from equity \nraises, share buybacks and external bid levels, etc. A \ndiscount or premium may be included in the fair value \nestimate.\n\u2022Contingency probability:  Probability associated with the \nrealization of an underlying event upon which the value of \nan asset is contingent.\n\u2022EBITDA multiple / Exit multiple: The ratio of Enterprise \nValue to EBITDA, where Enterprise Value is the aggregate \nvalue of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. \nThe EBITDA multiple reflects the value of the company in \nterms of its full-year EBITDA, whereas the exit multiple \nreflects the value of the company in terms of its full-year \nexpected EBITDA at exit. Either multiple allows \ncomparison between companies from an operational \nperspective as the effect of capital structure, taxation and \ndepreciation/amortization is excluded.\n\u2022Recovery rat e: Amount expressed as a percentage of par \nthat is expected to be received when a credit event occurs.Table of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 2020 Form 10-K 106", "start_char_idx": 2185, "end_char_idx": 5494, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42964497-b7d1-4155-ac8f-cce9b7250979": {"__data__": {"id_": "42964497-b7d1-4155-ac8f-cce9b7250979", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d231b375-102b-4564-9f96-5c23dfd7ca94", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "dd6b78ae832823043209df6ac672f67d1191255224d237ffb562620d337d8dc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "842f9438-c3c1-45de-87f2-7ab902301318", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5dc38ce38b6dfac59a278345d096e1d735dcb8080cb0d26e60ef84773bb58076", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41e07fcf-55d9-4873-884e-ceb26eeac801", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a978269c9209751d5844d1764df3c13bee36232dbe8922c9cbb9266eafa0dde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "28b12d635ba4d6fa9e979d763e885d184eb4100781f7b3f99e7d0939cfd106c4", "text": "An increase (decrease) to the following significant \nunobservable inputs would generally result in a lower (higher) \nfair value.\n\u2022Cash-synthetic basis: The measure of the price differential \nbetween cash financial instruments and their synthetic \nderivative-based equivalents.

The credit spread of \na particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield \non a credit risk-free benchmark security or reference rate, \ntypically either U.S. Treasury or LIBOR.\n\u2022Interest rate curve:  The term structure of interest rates \n(relationship between interest rates and the time to \nmaturity) and a market\u2019s measure of future interest rates at \nthe time of observation. An interest rate curve is used to set \ninterest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and \nis a pricing input used in the discounting of any OTC \nderivative cash flow.\n\u2022Volatility:  The measure of variability in possible returns for \nan instrument given how much that instrument changes in \nvalue over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options and, generally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the \noption. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a \nparticular option depends on a number of factors, including \nthe nature of the risk underlying that option, the tenor and \nthe strike price of the option.\n\u2022Volatility skew:  The measure of the difference in implied \nvolatility for options with identical underliers and expiry \ndates but with different strikes.\nNet Asset Value Measurements  \nFund Interests  \n At December 31, 2020 At December 31, 2019\n$ in millionsCarrying\nValue CommitmentCarrying\nValue Commitment\nPrivate equity $ 2,367 $ 644 $ 2,078 $ 450 \nReal estate  1,403  136  1,349  150 \nHedge1 59  \u2014  94  4 \nTotal $ 3,829 $ 780 $ 3,521 $ 604 \n1.Investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate \nprovisions, which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a \ncertain initial period or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, \nrespectively.  \nAmounts in the previous table represent the Firm\u2019s carrying \nvalue of general and limited partnership interests in fund \ninvestments, as well as any related performance-based fees in \nthe form of carried interest.

The Firm manages its exposure to these \nderivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation \nstrategies, which include managing the credit and correlation \nrisk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, \ntranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. Aggregate \nmarket risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, \nand market risk measures are routinely monitored against \nthese limits. The Firm may also recover amounts on the \nunderlying reference obligation delivered to the Firm under \nCDS where credit protection was sold.\nSingle-Name CDS.     A CDS protects the buyer against the \nloss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the \nissuer. The protection buyer pays a periodic premium \n(generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is \nprotected for the period. The Firm, in turn, performs under a \nCDS if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. \nTypical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or \ninsolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and \nrestructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.\nIndex and Basket CDS.    Index and basket CDS are products \nwhere credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-\nname CDS. Generally, in the event of a default on one of the \nunderlying names, the Firm pays a pro rata portion of the total \nnotional amount of the CDS.\nThe Firm also enters into tranched index and basket CDS \nwhere credit protection is provided on a particular portion of \nthe portfolio loss distribution.

Increases in collateral margin \ncalls on secured financing due to market value declines may \nbe mitigated by increases in collateral margin calls on \nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell and securities \nborrowed transactions with similar quality collateral. \nAdditionally, the Firm may request lower quality collateral \npledged be replaced with higher quality collateral through \ncollateral substitution rights in the underlying agreements.\nThe Firm actively manages its secured financings in a manner \nthat reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured \nfinancings of less liquid assets and also considers the quality \nof collateral when negotiating collateral eligibility with \ncounterparties.

For these transactions, adherence to the \nFirm\u2019s collateral policies significantly limits its credit \nexposure in the event of a customer default.

The provision was \nprimarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset \nquality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the \noutlook for the sectors in focus due to COVID-19. Charge-\noffs in 2020 were primarily related to certain Commercial real \nestate and Corporate loans in the Institutional Securities \nbusiness segment.  The base scenario used in our ACL models \nas of December 31, 2020 was generated using a combination \nof industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and \ninternally developed and validated models. Given the nature \nof our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is \nU.S. GDP. The base scenario, among other things, assumes a \ncontinued recovery through 2021, supported by fiscal \nstimulus and monetary policy measures.  \nSee Note 2  for a description of the ACL calculated under the \nCECL methodology, including credit quality indicators, used \nfor HFI loans beginning in 2020 and for a summary of the \ndifferences compared with the Firm\u2019s ACL methodology \nunder the prior incurred los s model .

The Firm may be required to \nreturn all or a portion of such distributions to the limited \npartners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a \ncertain return as specified in the various partnership \nagreements, subject to certain limitations.\nClient Clearing Guarantees.  In 2019, the Firm became a \nsponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of \nthe FICC's Sponsored Clearing Model. Clients of the Firm, as \nsponsored members, can transact in overnight securities \nrepurchase and resale agreements, which are cleared through \nthe FICC. As sponsoring member, the Firm guarantees to the \nFICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its \nclients\u2019 obligations. In 2020, the FICC\u2019s sponsored clearing \nmodel was updated such that the Firm could be responsible \nfor liquidation of a sponsored member\u2019s account and \nguarantees any resulting loss to the FICC in the event the \nsponsored member fails to fully pay any net liquidation \namount due from the sponsored member to the F ICC. \nAccordingly, the Firm\u2019s maximum potential payout amount \nreflects the total of the estimated net liquidation amounts for \nsponsored member accounts. The Firm minimizes credit \nexposure under this guarantee by obtaining a security interest \nin its sponsored member clients\u2019 collateral and their \ncontractual rights under sponsored member transactions. \nTherefore, the Firm's exposure is estimated to be an amount \nsubstantially lower than the maximum potential payout \namount. The collateral amount in which the Firm has a \nsecurity interest is approximately equal to the maximum \npotential payout amount of the guarantee.Other Guarantees and Indemnities\nIn the normal course of business, the Firm provides \nguarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. \nThese provisions generally are standard contractual terms. \nCertain of these guarantees and indemnifications are \ndescribed below:\n\u2022Indemnities . The Firm provides standard indemnities to \ncounterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, \nincluding U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest \nand other payments made on derivatives, securities and \nstock lending transactions, certain annuity products and \nother financial arrangements. These indemnity payments \ncould be required based on a change in the tax laws, a \nchange in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a \nchange in factual circumstances. Certain contracts contain \nprovisions that enable the Firm to terminate the agreement \nupon the occurrence of such events. The maximum \npotential amount of future payments that the Firm could be \nrequired to make under these indemnifications cannot be \nestimated.\n\u2022Exchange/ Clearinghouse  Member Guarantees.  The Firm is \na member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that \ntrade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. \nAssociated with its membership, the Firm may be required \nto pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or \nthe clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members \nor pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of \nanother member that may default on its obligations to the \nexchange or the clearinghouse.

Certain of the actual \nor threatened legal actions include claims for substantial \ncompensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for \nindeterminate amounts of damages.

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization \nActivities  \nOverview\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course \nof business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be \nVIEs.\nThe Firm\u2019s variable interests in VIEs include debt and equity \ninterests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments \nand certain fees. The Firm\u2019s involvement with VIEs arises \nprimarily from:\n\u2022Interests purchased in connection with market-making \nactivities, securities held in its Investment securities \nportfolio and retained interests held as a result of \nsecuritization activities, including re-securitization \ntransactions.\n\u2022Guarantees issued and residual interests retained in \nconnection with municipal bond securitizations.\n\u2022Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, \nequity, real estate or other assets.\n\u2022Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n\u2022Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackag ing notes \ndesigned to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n\u2022Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-\nefficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a \nVIE upon its initial involvement with the VIE and reassesses \nwhether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as \nlong as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This \ndetermination is based upon an analysis of the design of the \nVIE, including the VIE\u2019s structure and activities, the power to \nmake significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by \nother parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and \nother parties.\nThe power to make the most significant economic decisions \nmay take a number of different forms in different types of \nVIEs. The Firm considers servicing or collateral management \ndecisions as representing the power to make the most \nsignificant economic decisions in transactions such as \nsecuritizations or CDOs. As a result, the Firm does not \nconsolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act \nas the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain \nother rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to \nrequire the liquidation of the entity. If the Firm serves as \nservicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights \ndescribed in the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the \ninterests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates only those \nVIEs for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the \nVIE.\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, \nCLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no \nsignificant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In \nthese cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the \ntermination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of \nthese transactions that decisions made prior to the initial \nclosing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors \nbased upon the nature of the assets, including whether the \nassets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the Firm and \nthe extent of the information available to the Firm and to \ninvestors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, \nother rights held by the Firm and investors, the \nstandardization of the legal documentation and the level of \ncontinuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount \nand type of interests owned by the Firm and by other \ninvestors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right \nheld by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the \nVIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other \nasset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.\nConsolidated VIE Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\n At December 31, 2020 At December 31, 2019\n$ in millions VIE Assets VIE Liabilities VIE Assets VIE Liabilities\nOSF $ 551 $ 350 $ 696 $ 391 \nMABS1 590  17  265  4 \nOther2 977  47  987  66 \nTotal $ 2,118 $ 414 $ 1,948 $ 461 \nOSF\u2014Other structured financings\n1.Amounts include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial \nmortgage loans and other types of assets, including consumer or commercial \nassets and may be in loan or security form.

See Note 7  \nfor further information on derivative instruments and hedging \nactivities.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Firm holds securities issued by VIEs within the \nInvestment securities portfolio. These securities are composed \nof those related to transactions sponsored by the federal \nmortgage agencies and predominantly the most senior \nsecurities issued by VIEs backed by student loans and \ncommercial mortgage loans. Transactions sponsored by the \nfederal mortgage agencies include an explicit or implicit \nguarantee provided by the U.S. government. Additionally, the \nFirm holds certain commercial mortgage-backed securities \nissued by VIEs retained as a result of the Firm's securitization \nactivities. See Note 8  for further information on the \nInvestment securities portfolio.\nMunicipal Tender Option Bond Trusts\nIn a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client \ntransfers a municipal bond to a trust. The trust issues short-\nterm securities that the Firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to \ninvestors. The client generally retains a residual interest. The \nshort-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility \npursuant to which the investors may put their short-term \ninterests. In most programs, a third-party provider will \nprovide such liquidity facility; in some programs, the Firm \nprovides this liquidity facility.\nThe Firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for \nremarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. \nThe client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. \nThe liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction \nupon the occurrence of certain events. When the transaction is \nterminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to \nthe client. Any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon \nthe sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. This \nobligation is generally collateralized. Liquidity facilities \nprovided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified \nas derivatives. The Firm consolidates any municipal tender \noption bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.\nCredit Protection Purchased through Credit-Linked Notes\nCLN transactions are designed to provide investors with \nexposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. In these \ntransactions, the Firm transfers assets (generally high-quality \nsecurities or money market investments) to an SPE, enters \ninto a derivative transaction in which the SPE sells protection \non an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a \ncredit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the SPE to \ninvestors. In some transactions, the Firm may also enter into \ninterest rate or currency swaps with the SPE. Depending on \nthe structure, the assets and liabilities of the SPE may be \nconsolidated and recognized in the Firm\u2019s balance sheets or \naccounted for as a sale of assets.Upon the occurrence of a credit event related to the referenced \nasset, the SPE will deliver securities collateral as payment to \nthe Firm, which exposes the Firm to changes in the \ncollateral\u2019s value.\nDerivative payments by the SPE are collateralized. The risks \nassociated with these and similar derivatives with SPEs are \nessentially the same as those with non-SPE counterparties and \nare managed as part of the Firm\u2019s overall exposure.\nOther Structured Financings\nThe Firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop \nand own low-income communities (including low-income \nhousing projects) and entities that construct and own facilities \nthat will generate energy from renewable resources. The \ninterests entitle the Firm to a share of tax credits and tax \nlosses generated by these projects. In addition, the Firm has \nissued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housing \nfunds. The guarantees are designed to return an investor\u2019s \ncontribution to a fund and the investor\u2019s share of tax losses \nand tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. The \nFirm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-\nefficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\nCollateralized Loan and Debt Obligations\nCLOs and CDOs are SPEs that purchase a pool of assets \nconsisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, ABS or \nsynthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives,  and \nissue multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to \ninvestors. The Firm underwrites the securities issued in \ncertain CLO transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors \nand provides advisory services to these unaffiliated sponsors. \nThe Firm sells corporate loans to many of these SPEs, in \nsome cases representing a significant portion of the total \nassets purchased. Although not obligated, the Firm generally \nmakes a market in the securities issued by SPEs in these \ntransactions and may retain unsold securities.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4861, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7410b8d8-f14f-4d0b-ab56-15fcdbc4b8b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "7410b8d8-f14f-4d0b-ab56-15fcdbc4b8b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "87a1e1eb-d15a-4257-8a22-eafc37a69403", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "def801df74bf01ec5073acb996a718e6288836e606683946f392f8f652282d57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29e322f0-b162-4e89-87e1-b0da9b6cc18f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f1058432d40a5644038f15196f49aed4c017b099c5a45d7e5f509c514f6e4df7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "520375d4-515d-4be6-a19e-e04d72a35dfc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "08eada7e98ed5953b7ac514abe06701b094e6f57ea08daa0651511589e95e688", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6fcc8b425c0f626c9f9e613c37436354f84b5ebb008aea2c12db77fdc1eb5895", "text": "The \nFirm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-\nefficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\nCollateralized Loan and Debt Obligations\nCLOs and CDOs are SPEs that purchase a pool of assets \nconsisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, ABS or \nsynthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives,  and \nissue multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to \ninvestors.

The regulatory capital requirements are largely \nbased on the Basel III capital standards established by the \nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision and also implement \ncertain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and \nleverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital \nrequirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory \ncapital and RWA follows.\nMinimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to \nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total \ncapital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Capital standards \nrequire certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital \nfor purposes of determining these ratios.\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule, \nconsistent with an interim final rule  that was effective March \n31, 2020 , altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital rules, \nthe required adoption time period for CECL. As of December \n31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts \nand ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and \nsupplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the \neffect of the adoption of CECL based on the Firm\u2019s  election \nto defer this effect over a five-year transition period in \naccordance with the interim final rule. \nRisk-Based Regulatory Capital Ratio Requirements\nAt\nDecember 31,\n2020At\nDecember 31,\n2019\nStandardized AdvancedStandardized \nand Advanced\nCapital buffers\nCapital conservation buffer  \u2014  2.5%  2.5% \nStress capital buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d)  5.7% N/A N/A\nG-SIB capital surcharge  3.0%  3.0%  3.0% \nCCyB10% 0% 0%\nCapital buffer requirement2 8.7%  5.5%  5.5% At\nDecember 31,\n2020At\nDecember 31,\n2019\nRegulatory \nMinimum Standardized AdvancedStandardized \nand Advanced\nRequired ratios3\nCommon Equity Tier 1 \ncapital ratio  4.5%  13.2%  10.0%  10.0% \nTier 1 capital ratio  6.0%  14.7%  11.5%  11.5% \nTotal capital ratio  8.0%  16.7%  13.5%  13.5% \n1.The CCyB can be set up to 2.5% , but is currently set by the U.S. banking agencies \nat zero.\n2.The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital the Firm must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements \nin order to avoid restrictions on the Firm\u2019s ability to make capital distributions, \nincluding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay \ndiscretionary bonuses to executive officers.

The U.S. Qualified Plan uses a \ncombination of active and risk-controlled fixed income \ninvestment strategies. The fixed income asset allocation \nconsists primarily of fixed income securities and related \nderivative instruments designed to approximate the expected \ncash flows of the plan\u2019s liabilities in order to help reduce plan \nexposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets \nwith the obligation. The longer-duration fixed income \nallocation is expected to help protect the plan\u2019s funded status \nand maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long \nrun. The investment portfolio performance is assessed by \ncomparing actual investment performance with changes in the \nestimated present value of the U.S. Qualified Plan\u2019s benefit \nobligation.\nDerivative instruments are permitted in the U.S. Qualified \nPlan\u2019s investment portfolio only to the extent that they \ncomply with all of the plan\u2019s investment policy guidelines and \nare consistent with the plan\u2019s risk and return objectives.\nAs a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the \nunderlying assets apply to the  respective  derivative product. \nThis includes percentage allocations and credit quality. \nDerivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancing investment  returns  in the underlying assets and not to \ncircumvent portfolio restrictions.\nPlan assets are measured at fair value using valuation \ntechniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques \napplied to the Firm\u2019s major categories of assets and liabilities \nas described in Notes 2 and 5. OTC derivative contracts \nconsist of investments in interest rate swaps and total return \nswaps. Other investments consist of pledged insurance \nannuity contracts held by non-U.S.-based plans. The pledged \ninsurance annuity contracts are valued based on the premium \nreserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer has \ngiven to the employee benefit plan that approximates fair \nvalue. The pledged insurance annuity contracts are \ncategorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nCommingled trust funds are privately offered funds regulated, \nsupervised and subject to periodic examination by a U.S. \nfederal or state agency and available to institutional clients. \nThe trust must be maintained for the collective investment or \nreinvestment of assets contributed to it from U.S. tax-\nqualified employee benefit plans maintained by more than one \nemployer or controlled group of corporations. The sponsor of \nthe commingled trust funds values the funds based on the fair \nvalue of the underlying securities.

A company\u2019s \ninternal control over financial reporting includes those \npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of \nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect \nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; \n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company \nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of \nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide \nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection \nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the \ncompany\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over \nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future \nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the \ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate.\n \n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 26, 2021\n Table of Contents\nDecember 2020 Form 10-K 158", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4114, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f105c60-9451-46ef-b5be-724737999f34": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f105c60-9451-46ef-b5be-724737999f34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed01b38e-cfd6-4aa3-996f-43038470fe1e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c4976cabc5dcbac703f647f3e058c3079528f2ef1c54671e6c3d2772c26e2d05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f883e6a3-bff5-4f6a-8aa5-4a3c123c270e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "97149391f4da8bc20be2123bb3dbe83af0b359fa10ec302d4bd3d99b4a7e78ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "37eb91a4-1c5c-43dc-bcf6-9a25a2ccb5fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3db7ceaa0f96fe6e2bd84ca3a56aabd77ad972a7aab6a9b5be77b1ad69a5f21a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "91cfc51d6cf6373b2b0d77a689cc7c5f87a6cc50f9889916b5c4ee07dba3ae6e", "text": "Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo change in the Firm\u2019s internal control over financial \nreporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule \n13a-15(f)) occurred during the quarter ended December 31, \n2020  that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to \nmaterially affect, the Firm\u2019s internal control over financial \nreporting.\nOther Information\nNone .\nUnresolved Staff Comments\nThe Firm, like other well-known seasoned issuers, from time \nto time receives written comments from the staff of the SEC \nregarding its periodic or current reports under the Exchange \nAct.

Our current facilities are adequate for our present \nand future operations for each of our business segments, \nalthough we may add regional offices, depending upon our \nfuture operations.\nLegal  Proceedings\nIn addition to the matters described below, in the normal \ncourse of business, the Firm has been named, from time to \ntime, as a defendant in various legal actions, including \narbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in \nconnection with its activities as a global diversified financial \nservices institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal \nactions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or \npunitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of \ndamages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be \nthe primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in \nfinancial distress.\nThe Firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, \ninvestigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by \ngovernmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the \nFirm\u2019s business, and involving, among other matters, sales \nand trading activities, financial products or offerings \nsponsored, underwritten or sold by the Firm, and accounting \nand operational matters, certain of which may result in \nadverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or \nother relief.The Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as \nappropriate in each pending matter. Where available \ninformation indicates that it is probable a liability had been \nincurred at the date of the financial statements and the Firm \ncan reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm \naccrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. The Firm\u2019s \nfuture legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, \ngiven the current environment regarding government \ninvestigations and private litigation affecting global financial \nservices firms, including the Firm.\nIn many proceedings and investigations, however, it is \ninherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable \nor even possible, or to estimate the amount of any loss. The \nFirm cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such \nproceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the \neventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may \nbe, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the \nfactual record is being developed or contested or where \nplaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or \nindeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. \nNumerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or \nadditional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can \nbe reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, \nincluding through potentially lengthy discovery and \ndetermination of important factual matters, determination of \nissues related to class certification and the calculation of \ndamages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled \nlegal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in \nquestion. Subject to the foregoing, the Firm believes, based \non current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that \nthe outcome of such proceedings and investigations will not \nhave a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the \nFirm, although the outcome of such proceedings or \ninvestigations could be material to the Firm\u2019s operating \nresults and cash flows for a particular period depending on, \namong other things, the level of the Firm\u2019s revenues or \nincome for such period.\nWhile the Firm has identified below certain proceedings that \nthe Firm believes to be material, individually or collectively, \nthere can be no assurance that additional material losses will \nnot be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or \nare not yet determined to be material.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4913, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37eb91a4-1c5c-43dc-bcf6-9a25a2ccb5fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "37eb91a4-1c5c-43dc-bcf6-9a25a2ccb5fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed01b38e-cfd6-4aa3-996f-43038470fe1e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c4976cabc5dcbac703f647f3e058c3079528f2ef1c54671e6c3d2772c26e2d05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f105c60-9451-46ef-b5be-724737999f34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "MS2020.pdf", "file_path": "data\\MS\\MS2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6890037, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "91cfc51d6cf6373b2b0d77a689cc7c5f87a6cc50f9889916b5c4ee07dba3ae6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe23b171-43d3-45b1-9c4c-52185269644c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "23e0243eb625573667856c24e7fbc12ef59b952cfa8300ef6762b52d64cd7835", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3db7ceaa0f96fe6e2bd84ca3a56aabd77ad972a7aab6a9b5be77b1ad69a5f21a", "text": "Subject to the foregoing, the Firm believes, based \non current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that \nthe outcome of such proceedings and investigations will not \nhave a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the \nFirm, although the outcome of such proceedings or \ninvestigations could be material to the Firm\u2019s operating \nresults and cash flows for a particular period depending on, \namong other things, the level of the Firm\u2019s revenues or \nincome for such period.\nWhile the Firm has identified below certain proceedings that \nthe Firm believes to be material, individually or collectively, \nthere can be no assurance that additional material losses will \nnot be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or \nare not yet determined to be material.\nResidential Mortgage and Credit Crisis Related Matters\nOn July 15, 2010, China Development Industrial Bank \n(\u201cCDIB\u201d) filed a complaint against the Firm, styled China \nDevelopment Industrial Bank v.
