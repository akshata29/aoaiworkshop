Theirimportance has been highlighted by numerous highlypublicized events in recent years, including (i) cyber attacksagainst financial institutions, governmental agencies, largeconsumer-based companies and other organizations thatresulted in the unauthorized disclosure of personalinformation of clients and customers and other sensitive orconfidential information, the theft and destruction ofcorporate information and requests for ransom payments,and (ii) extreme weather events.\nOur Business Continuity & Technology Resilience Program\nhas been developed to provide reasonable assurance ofbusiness continuity in the event of disruptions at our criticalfacilities or systems and to comply with regulatoryrequirements, including those of FINRA. Because we are aBHC, our Business Continuity & Technology ResilienceProgram is also subject to review by the FRB. The keyelements of the program are crisis management, businesscontinuity, technology resilience, business recovery,assurance and verification, and process improvement. Inthe area of information security, we have developed andimplemented a framework of principles, policies andtechnology designed to protect the information provided tous by our clients and our own information from cyberattacks and other misappropriation, corruption or loss.Safeguards are designed to maintain the confidentiality,integrity and availability of information.\nEmployees\nManagement believes that a major strength and principalreason for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality anddedication of our people and the shared sense of being partof a team. We strive to maintain a work environment thatfosters professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperationamong our employees worldwide and high standards ofbusiness ethics.\nInstilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a\ncontinuous process, in which training plays an importantpart. All employees are offered the opportunity to participatein education and periodic seminars that we sponsor atvarious locations throughout the world. Another importantpart of instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employeereview process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors,co-workers and employees they supervise in a 360-degreereview process that is integral to our team approach, andwhich includes an evaluation of an employee\u2019s performancewith respect to risk management, compliance and diversity.As of December 2018, we had headcount of 36,600.Competition\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses areintensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so.Our competitors are other entities that provide investmentbanking, market-making and investment managementservices, and commercial and/or consumer lending anddeposit-taking products, as well as those entities that makeinvestments in securities, commodities, derivatives, realestate, loans and other financial assets. These entitiesinclude brokers and dealers, investment banking firms,commercial banks, insurance companies, investmentadvisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds,merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financialtechnology and other internet-based companies. Wecompete with some entities globally and with others on aregional, product or niche basis. We compete based on anumber of factors, including transaction execution,products and services, innovation, reputation and price.\nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to\nretain market share by committing capital to businesses ortransactions on terms that offer returns that may not becommensurate with their risks. In particular, corporateclients seek such commitments (such as agreements toparticipate in their loan facilities) from financial servicesfirms in connection with investment banking and otherassignments.\nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased\nthe capital base and geographic reach of some of ourcompetitors, and have also hastened the globalization of thesecurities and other financial services markets. As a result,we have had to commit capital to support our internationaloperations and to execute large global transactions. To takeadvantage of some of our most significant opportunities,we will have to compete successfully with financialinstitutions that are larger and have more capital and thatmay have a stronger local presence and longer operatinghistory outside the U.S.\nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more\ntargeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Someclients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible topotential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as describedbelow, our ability to effectively compete with them could beaffected by regulations and limitations on activities thatapply to us but may not apply to them.\nGoldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K 5", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5014, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d589457f-ad86-4743-87b1-e9af1a6ea10d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d589457f-ad86-4743-87b1-e9af1a6ea10d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b2c365c-eb22-4937-b4da-31a0501e9767", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "255150af32806793ccaf6189848174642333abdfb11bd72a9266196a45291ce4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "51b7f389-d7e7-42a6-8435-4c41a889b590", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "96a21399153e21db8a814709a44c1ef5c4d51b9261a4bafdb95097e78aeefc58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee42b731-e680-47c7-87a4-f964eecd6a30", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "79d488a0c9fcab4896d9671224c3def761220be0e6b6ec60b527a62dc5dc8a1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "944c03a48168ae03cea3e0f94280bd485fc0db9a640d7bd5536713c8a241d9dc", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nA number of our businesses are subject to intense price\ncompetition. Efforts by our competitors to gain marketshare have resulted in pricing pressure in our investmentbanking and market-making businesses, and could result inpricing pressure in other of our businesses. For example, theincreasing volume of trades executed electronically,through the internet and through alternative tradingsystems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions,in that commissions for electronic trading are generallylower than for non-electronic trading. It appears that thistrend toward low-commission trading will continue. Pricecompetition has also led to compression in the differencebetween the price at which a market participant is willing tosell an instrument and the price at which another marketparticipant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), whichhas affected our market-making businesses. In addition, webelieve that we will continue to experience competitivepressures in these and other areas in the future as some ofour competitors seek to obtain market share by furtherreducing prices, and as we enter into or expand ourpresence in markets that may rely more heavily onelectronic trading and execution.\nWe also compete on the basis of the types of financial\nproducts that we and our competitors offer. In somecircumstances, our competitors may offer financialproducts that we do not offer and that our clients mayprefer.\nThe provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\nand Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), therequirements promulgated by the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financialregulation could affect our competitive position to theextent that limitations on activities, increased fees andcompliance costs or other regulatory requirements do notapply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors orare not implemented uniformly across differentjurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrictinvestments in certain hedge and private equity fundsdifferentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-basedbanking organizations and give non-U.S.-based bankingorganizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S.and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S.\nLikewise, the obligations with respect to derivative\ntransactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend,in part, on the location of the counterparties to thetransaction. The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and otherregulatory developments on our competitive position willdepend to a large extent on the manner in which therequired rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, theextent of international convergence, and the developmentof market practice and structures under the new regulatoryregimes as described further in \u201cRegulation\u201d below.We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining\nqualified employees. Our ability to continue to competeeffectively will depend upon our ability to attract newemployees, retain and motivate our existing employees andto continue to compensate employees competitively amidintense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensationpractices of large financial institutions. Our pay practicesand those of certain of our competitors are subject toreview by, and the standards of, the FRB and otherregulators inside and outside the U.S., including thePrudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the FinancialConduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We also compete foremployees with institutions whose pay practices are notsubject to regulatory oversight. See \u201cRegulation \u2014Compensation Practices\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Ourbusinesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hireand retain qualified employees\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of thisForm 10-K for further information about such regulation.\nRegulation\nAs a participant in the global financial services industry, we aresubject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide.The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules thereunder, significantlyaltered the U.S. financial regulatory regime within which weoperate and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulationand Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (collectively,MiFID II) have significantly revised the regulatory regime forour European operations. The Basel Committee\u2019s frameworkfor strengthening the regulation, supervision and riskmanagement of banks (Basel III), is implemented by the FRB,the PRA and other national regulators. The Basel Committeeis the primary global standard setter for prudential bankregulation. However, its standards are not effective in anyjurisdiction until rules implementing such standards have beenimplemented by the relevant regulators. The implications ofsuch regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent ontheir implementation by the relevant regulators globally, andthe market practices and structures that develop.\nIn 2017 and 2018, the U.S.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4989, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee42b731-e680-47c7-87a4-f964eecd6a30": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee42b731-e680-47c7-87a4-f964eecd6a30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b2c365c-eb22-4937-b4da-31a0501e9767", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "255150af32806793ccaf6189848174642333abdfb11bd72a9266196a45291ce4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d589457f-ad86-4743-87b1-e9af1a6ea10d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "944c03a48168ae03cea3e0f94280bd485fc0db9a640d7bd5536713c8a241d9dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd02d819-d28f-4679-83ec-57b89ec05911", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea52f604422c1ec72a70e0c11b042b4bcaaf87b21e9c8624c74e0376a1b068cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "79d488a0c9fcab4896d9671224c3def761220be0e6b6ec60b527a62dc5dc8a1f", "text": "financial regulatory regime within which weoperate and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulationand Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (collectively,MiFID II) have significantly revised the regulatory regime forour European operations.

GSI provides broker-dealer services in and from the U.K., and GSIB acts as aprimary dealer for European government bonds and isinvolved in market making in European government bonds,lending (including securities lending) and deposit-takingactivities. GSIB\u2019s consumer-oriented deposit-takingactivities are subject to U.K. consumer protectionregulations. Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (\u201cGSBE,\u201dformerly Goldman Sachs AG), our German banksubsidiary, is regulated by the BaFin and DeutscheBundesbank within the context of the European SingleSupervisory Mechanism. In addition, in December 2018,our German subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Europe SE, wasapproved by BaFin as an authorized investment firm, whichwill allow it to conduct certain activities (such as activitiesrelated to physical commodities) which GSBE may beprevented from undertaking.\nCapital and Li quidity Re quirements. We and GS Bank\nUSA are subject to regulatory risk-based capital andleverage requirements that are calculated in accordancewith the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). TheCapital Framework is largely based on Basel III and alsoimplements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are\u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking organizations. We havealso been designated as a global systemically importantbank (G-SIB). Under the FRB\u2019s capital adequacyrequirements, we and GS Bank USA must meet specificregulatory capital requirements that involve quantitativemeasures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheetitems. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject toqualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USAare also subject to liquidity requirements established by theU.S. federal bank regulatory agencies.In October 2018, the FRB released two proposals that\nwould generally make the applicable capital and liquidityrequirements less stringent for large U.S. bankingorganizations other than those that are U.S. G-SIBs, such asus.\nGSI and GSIB are subject to capital requirements prescribed\nin the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and theE.U. Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV). GSIand GSIB are subject to liquidity requirements establishedby U.K. regulatory authorities that are similar to thoseapplicable to GS Bank USA and us.\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios. The Capital Framework\nprovides for an additional capital ratio requirement thatconsists of three components: (i) for capital conservation(capital conservation buffer), (ii) for countercyclicality(countercyclical capital buffer) and (iii) as a consequence ofour designation as a G-SIB (G-SIB buffer). The additionalcapital ratio requirement must be satisfied entirely withcapital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1). GSBank USA is subject to the first two components of theadditional capital ratio requirement discussed above.\nThe capital conservation buffer and G-SIB buffer began to\nphase in on January 1, 2016 and continued to do sothrough January 1, 2019. In April 2018, the FRB proposeda rule that would, among other things, replace the capitalconservation buffer with a stress capital buffer (SCB)requirement for large BHCs subject to the FRB\u2019sComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). See\u201cRegulation \u2014 Banking Supervision and Regulation \u2014Stress Tests\u201d for further information about this proposedrule.\nThe countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract\nsystemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to\u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking organizations. Severalother national supervisors also require countercyclicalcapital buffers. The G-SIB and countercyclical capitalbuffers applicable to us could change in the future and, as aresult, the minimum capital ratios to which we are subjectcould change.\nIn December 2018, the U.S. federal bank regulatory\nagencies issued a final rule that would provide an optionalthree-year phase-in period for the day-one regulatorycapital effects of the adoption of the Current ExpectedCredit Losses (CECL) accounting standard.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4535, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d9a395b-21d8-494b-9146-4b2a3ae9db8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d9a395b-21d8-494b-9146-4b2a3ae9db8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ea5b54f-1489-4a69-85e1-562f8d4c3a08", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ecd30c44d870d508ba6a780afd5a952eacc4441701b8f2dccbc6491431850202", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0363522a-e889-4a8b-b7d7-421a426135a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8b24847660189e43e051d803508bb1595b58d1a8fd32aa6164e0bf1673df8e02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc58ad43-86c8-4b0a-8fd6-479690187899", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "78ac39cc5470de64546cfaedd258105b7dcec075f5cdd0db34687d12adc11f3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "34e535fc02386670b7a4383557eeb59eb9bdbb681ab83c4f7cac4ea94973e565", "text": "See\u201cRegulation \u2014 Banking Supervision and Regulation \u2014Stress Tests\u201d for further information about this proposedrule.\nThe countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract\nsystemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to\u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking organizations.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn October 2018, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies\nissued a proposed rule that would implement the BaselCommittee\u2019s standardized approach for measuringcounterparty credit risk exposures in connection withderivative contracts (SA-CCR). Under the proposal,\u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking organizations would berequired to use SA-CCR for purposes of calculating theirstandardized risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and, with someadjustments, for purposes of determining theirsupplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) discussed below.\nThe Basel Committee has published final guidelines for\ncalculating incremental capital ratio requirements forbanking institutions that are systemically significant from adomestic but not global perspective (D-SIBs). If theseguidelines are implemented by national regulators, they willapply, among others, to certain subsidiaries of G-SIBs.These guidelines are in addition to the framework forG-SIBs, but are more principles-based. CRD IV and theCRR provide that institutions that are systemicallyimportant at the E.U. or member state level, known as othersystemically important institutions (O-SIIs), may be subjectto additional capital ratio requirements of up to 2% ofCET1, according to their degree of systemic importance(O-SII buffers). O-SIIs are identified annually, along withtheir applicable buffers. The PRA has identified GoldmanSachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company ofGSI and GSIB, as an O-SII. GSG UK\u2019s O-SII buffer iscurrently set at zero percent.\nIn January 2019, the Basel Committee finalized revisions to\nthe framework for calculating capital requirements formarket risk, which is expected to increase market riskcapital requirements for most banking organizations,although to a lesser degree than the version of theframework issued in January 2016. The revised framework,among other things, revises the standardized approach andinternal models to calculate market risk requirements andclarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capitalrequirements. The Basel Committee has proposed thatnational regulators implement the revised frameworkbeginning January 1, 2022. The U.S. federal bankregulatory agencies and the European Commission havenot yet proposed rules implementing the 2019 version ofthe revised market risk framework for the U.S. and E.U.financial institutions, respectively.In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards\nthat it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisisregulatory reforms. These standards set a floor on internallymodeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capitalrequirements under the standardized approach. They alsorevise the Basel Committee\u2019s standardized and model-basedapproaches for credit risk, provide a new standardizedapproach for operational risk capital and revise theframeworks for credit valuation adjustment risk. The BaselCommittee has proposed that national regulators implementthese standards beginning January 1, 2022, and that the newfloor be phased in through January 1, 2027.\nThe Basel Committee has also published updated\nframeworks relating to Pillar 3 disclosure requirements andthe regulatory capital treatment of securitization exposuresand a revised G-SIB assessment methodology. The U.S.federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rulesimplementing the December 2017 standards for purposes ofrisk-based capital ratios or the Basel Committee frameworks.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations \u2014 Equity CapitalManagement and Regulatory Capital\u201d in Part II, Item 7 ofthis Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financialstatements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K forinformation about the capital ratios of the firm, GS BankUSA and GSI.\nAs described in \u201cOther Restrictions\u201d below, in\nSeptember 2016, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would,among other things, require FHCs to hold additional capitalin connection with covered physical commodity activities.\nLeverage Ratios.

This proposal and the proposal to useSA-CCR for purposes of calculating the SLR wouldimplement certain of the revisions to the leverage ratioframework published by the Basel Committee inDecember 2017.\nThe Basel Committee has also issued consultation papers\non, among other matters, changes to leverage ratiotreatment of client cleared derivatives and the publicdisclosure of daily average balances for certain componentsof leverage ratio calculations.\nThe European Commission\u2019s November 2016 proposal to\namend the CRR would implement the Basel III leverageratio framework by establishing a 3% minimum leverageratio requirement for certain E.U. financial institutions,including GSI and GSIB, but it has not been enacted.\nGoldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K 9", "start_char_idx": 3813, "end_char_idx": 5140, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c94e578-c355-4459-9586-f4d3aef7d0c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c94e578-c355-4459-9586-f4d3aef7d0c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3cef488d-149d-4b93-a968-acdc3e93778f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "300b2cf5bda5e4898d2a5980dd4621b8486b2f799c807d510856924bf55d6380", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "459a1a27-a2e9-4f50-a460-7efd67ba25dd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "384f9863a4b0beaf3ad79df97eb23d2c8ecfe698a540b7e196594d071b6857e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1faa8d69-55b4-454b-8165-0fc3a9f9390d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "912622ef1fce816f5fa766e79c73477a04c3faf3770b9551c9699fed78ce78cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1fcb8f201fa2d66283b4da1f43d59d3d58dcaa502010032eac2bfbc3096640a9", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The Basel Committee\u2019s framework for\nliquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoringrequires banking organizations to measure their liquidityagainst two specific liquidity tests: the Liquidity CoverageRatio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).\nThe LCR rule issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory\nagencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank USA isgenerally consistent with the Basel Committee\u2019s frameworkand is designed to ensure that a banking organizationmaintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-qualityliquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cashoutflows under an acute short-term liquidity stressscenario. The LCR rule issued by the EuropeanCommission and applicable to GSI and GSIB is alsogenerally consistent with the Basel Committee\u2019sframework. We are required to maintain a minimum LCRof 100%. We disclose, on a quarterly basis, our averagedaily LCR over the quarter. See \u201cAvailable Information.\u201d\nThe NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term\nstable funding of the assets and off-balance-sheet activitiesof banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. TheBasel Committee\u2019s NSFR framework requires bankingorganizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%.\nIn May 2016, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies\nissued a proposed rule that would implement the NSFR forlarge U.S. banking organizations, including us and GS BankUSA. The European Commission\u2019s November 2016proposal to amend the CRR would implement the NSFRfor certain E.U. financial institutions. Neither the U.S.federal bank regulatory agencies nor the EuropeanCommission have released a final rule.\nThe FRB\u2019s enhanced prudential standards require BHCs,\nincluding Group Inc., with $100 billion or more in totalconsolidated assets, to comply with enhanced liquidity andoverall risk management standards, which includemaintaining a level of highly liquid assets based onprojected funding needs for 30 days, and increasedinvolvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overallrisk management. Although the liquidity requirement underthese rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a separaterequirement.See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations \u2014 Risk Management \u2014Overview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d and\u201c\u2014 Liquidity Risk Management\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of thisForm 10-K for information about the LCR and NSFR, as wellas our risk management practices and liquidity.\nStress Tests. As required by the FRB\u2019s annual CCAR rules,\nwe submit a capital plan for review by the FRB. In addition,we are required to perform company-run stress tests on asemi-annual basis, although the FRB has recently proposedto reduce the required frequency of these tests to annually.We publish summaries of our stress tests results on ourwebsite as described in \u201cAvailable Information\u201d below.\nOur annual stress test submission is incorporated into theannual capital plans that we submit to the FRB as part of theCCAR process for large BHCs, which is designed to ensurethat capital planning processes will permit continuedoperations by such institutions during times of economic andfinancial stress. As part of CCAR, the FRB evaluates aninstitution\u2019s plan to make capital distributions, such as byrepurchasing or redeeming stock or making dividendpayments, across a range of macroeconomic and firm-specificassumptions based on the institution\u2019s and the FRB\u2019s stresstests. If the FRB objects to an institution\u2019s capital plan, theinstitution is generally prohibited from making capitaldistributions other than those to which the FRB has notobjected. In addition, an institution faces limitations oncapital distributions to the extent that actual capital issuancesare less than the amounts indicated in its capital plan.\nIn April 2018, the FRB issued a proposed rule to establishstress buffer requirements. Under the proposal, the SCBwould replace the component of the capital conservationbuffer. The SCB, subject to a minimum, would reflectstressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenarioof the FRB\u2019s CCAR stress tests and would also include fourquarters of planned common stock dividends.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4594, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1faa8d69-55b4-454b-8165-0fc3a9f9390d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1faa8d69-55b4-454b-8165-0fc3a9f9390d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3cef488d-149d-4b93-a968-acdc3e93778f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "300b2cf5bda5e4898d2a5980dd4621b8486b2f799c807d510856924bf55d6380", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c94e578-c355-4459-9586-f4d3aef7d0c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1fcb8f201fa2d66283b4da1f43d59d3d58dcaa502010032eac2bfbc3096640a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "06b7ee27-17c3-4738-8380-6dac3d815474", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3876891f9207f77f19a0df1a3f9732f3e4efb992771b4824f03597a4890fe8fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "912622ef1fce816f5fa766e79c73477a04c3faf3770b9551c9699fed78ce78cb", "text": "If the FRB objects to an institution\u2019s capital plan, theinstitution is generally prohibited from making capitaldistributions other than those to which the FRB has notobjected.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDividends and Stock Repurchases. Dividend payments\nby Group Inc. to its shareholders and stock repurchases byGroup Inc. are subject to the oversight of the FRB.\nU.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the\npayment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, suchas GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of dividends thatmay be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of theamounts calculated under a \u201crecent earnings\u201d test and an\u201cundivided profits\u201d test. Under the recent earnings test, adividend may not be paid if the total of all dividendsdeclared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of thecurrent year\u2019s net income combined with the retained netincome of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtainsprior regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test,a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity\u2019s\u201cundivided profits\u201d (generally, accumulated net profits thathave not been paid out as dividends or transferred tosurplus).\nThe applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to\nprohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the bankingregulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend wouldconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of thefinancial condition of the banking organization.\nSource of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs\nto act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries andto commit capital and financial resources to support thosesubsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB attimes when we might otherwise determine not to provide it.Capital loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank aresubordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certainother indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if aBHC commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it willmaintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether inresponse to the FRB\u2019s invoking its source-of-strengthauthority or in response to other regulatory measures, thatcommitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee forthe BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority paymentin respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors ofthe BHC.Transactions between Affiliates. Transactions between\nGS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, on the one hand, andGroup Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates, on theother hand, are regulated by the FRB. These regulationsgenerally limit the types and amounts of transactions(including credit extensions from GS Bank USA or itssubsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries andaffiliates) that may take place and generally require thosetransactions to be on market terms or better to GS BankUSA or its subsidiaries. These regulations generally do notapply to transactions between GS Bank USA and itssubsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverageand scope of these regulations, including by applying themto the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions,repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, andsecurities borrowing and lending transactions.\nThe BHC Act prohibits the FRB from requiring a payment\nby a BHC subsidiary to a depository institution if thefunctional regulator of that subsidiary objects to suchpayment. In such a case, the FRB could instead require thedivestiture of the depository institution and imposeoperating restrictions pending the divestiture.\nResolution and Recovery. Group Inc. is required by the\nFRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for its rapidand orderly resolution in the event of material financialdistress or failure (resolution plan). If the regulators jointlydetermine that an institution has failed to remediateidentified shortcomings in its resolution plan and that itsresolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is notcredible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution underthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the regulators may jointlyimpose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidityrequirements or restrictions on growth, activities oroperations or may jointly order the institutions to divestassets or operations in order to facilitate orderly resolutionin the event of failure.

Ourresolution plan for GS Bank USA must, among other things,demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risksarising from our other entities.\nThe federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted final\nrules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts(QFCs) entered into by G-SIBs. The rules began to phase inon January 1, 2019 and will be fully effective onJanuary 1, 2020. The rules are intended to facilitate theorderly resolution of a failed G-SIB by limiting the ability ofthe G-SIB to enter into a QFC unless (i) the counterpartywaives certain default rights in such contract arising uponthe entry of the G-SIB or one of its affiliates into resolution,(ii) the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitionson the transfer of such contract and/or any related creditenhancement, and (iii) the counterparty agrees that thecontract will be subject to the special resolution regimes setforth in the Dodd-Frank Act orderly liquidation authority(OLA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950(FDIA), described below. Compliance can be achieved byadhering to the ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDAProtocol described below.\nCertain Group Inc. subsidiaries, along with those of a\nnumber of other major global banking organizations,adhere to the International Swaps and DerivativesAssociation Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDAUniversal Protocol), which was developed and updated incoordination with the Financial Stability Board (FSB), aninternational body that sets standards and coordinates thework of national financial authorities and internationalstandard-setting bodies. The ISDA Universal Protocolimposes a stay on certain cross-default and earlytermination rights within standard ISDA derivativecontracts and securities financing transactions betweenadhering parties in the event that one of them is subject toresolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolutionunder the OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. In addition, certainGroup Inc. subsidiaries adhere to the International Swapsand Derivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution StayProtocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol), which was based on theISDA Universal Protocol and was created to allow marketparticipants to comply with the final QFC rules adopted bythe federal bank regulatory agencies.The E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)\nestablishes a framework for the recovery and resolution offinancial institutions in the E.U., such as GSI and GSIB. TheBRRD provides national supervisory authorities with toolsand powers to pre-emptively address potential financialcrises in order to promote financial stability and minimizetaxpayers\u2019 exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U.member states to grant \u201cbail-in\u201d powers to E.U. resolutionauthorities to recapitalize a failing entity by writing downits unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt intoequity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide thatcontracts enable such actions.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe BRRD subjects institutions to a minimum requirement\nfor own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), which isgenerally consistent with the FSB\u2019s TLAC standard. InJune 2018, the Bank of England published a statement ofpolicy on internal MREL, which requires a material U.K.subsidiary of an overseas banking group, such as GSI, tomeet a minimum internal MREL requirement to facilitatethe transfer of losses to its resolution entity, which for GSIis Group Inc. The transitional minimum internal MRELrequirement began to phase in from January 1, 2019 andwill become fully effective on January 1, 2022. In order tocomply with the MREL statement of policy, bail-in triggershave been provided to the Bank of England over certainintercompany regulatory capital and senior debtinstruments issued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bankof England to write down such instruments or convert suchinstruments to equity. The triggers can be exercised by theBank of England if it determines that GSI has reached thepoint of non-viability and the FRB and the FDIC have notobjected to the bail-in or if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy orsimilar proceedings.\nThe European Commission\u2019s November 2016 proposed\namendments to the CRR and the BRRD include provisionsthat are designed to implement the FSB\u2019s minimum TLACrequirement for G-SIBs. The proposal would requiresubsidiaries of a non-E.U. G-SIB that account for more than5% of its RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure,such as GSI, to meet 90% of the requirement applicable toE.U. G-SIBs.\nIn November 2016, the European Commission also\nproposed to amend CRD IV to require a non-E.U. G-SIB,such as us, to establish an E.U. intermediate holdingcompany (E.U. IHC) if a firm has two or more of certaintypes of E.U. financial institution subsidiaries, includingbroker-dealers and banks. The European Commission alsoproposed amendments to the CRR that would require E.U.IHCs to satisfy MREL requirements and certain otherprudential requirements. These proposals are subject toadoption at the E.U. level and, for the directives,implementing rulemakings by E.U. member states, whichhave not yet occurred.Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a\nBank Holding Company. Under the FDIA, if the FDIC is\nappointed as conservator or receiver for an insureddepository institution such as GS Bank USA, upon itsinsolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broadpowers, including the power:\n\u2030To transfer any of the depository institution\u2019s assets and\nliabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed\u201cbridge\u201d bank, without the approval of the depositoryinstitution\u2019s creditors;\n\u2030To enforce the depository institution\u2019s contracts pursuant\nto their terms without regard to any provisions triggeredby the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or\n\u2030To repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which\nthe depository institution is a party, the performance ofwhich is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome andthe disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determinedby the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of thedepository institution.\nIn addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit\nliabilities and certain claims for administrative expensesagainst an insured depository institution would be affordeda priority over other general unsecured claims, includingdeposits at non-U.S. branches and claims of debtholders ofthe institution, in the \u201cliquidation or other resolution\u201d ofsuch an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether ornot the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligationsof GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors)would be treated differently from, and could receive, ifanything, substantially less than, the depositors of GS BankUSA.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime\n(known as OLA) for BHCs and their affiliates that aresystemically important and certain non-bank financialcompanies. Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed asreceiver for the systemically important institution and itsfailed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon the recommendationof applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasurydetermines, among other things, that the institution is indefault or in danger of default, that the institution\u2019s failurewould have serious adverse effects on the U.S.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4328, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "909a1afc-6637-4ad7-acb4-b690e7c2a415": {"__data__": {"id_": "909a1afc-6637-4ad7-acb4-b690e7c2a415", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d173583-53d5-428b-80df-e854aaa40e30", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d0923c708b1be2e81acf0cd23723d32ccd09d1cc808532b8020a2e645d01e5e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed0b7abf-1c3a-4532-9e33-da1f3a27dca3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "52f3346918702220a69eca1ea2bd00139ce928329c0ef5c947e534249172293e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "81295b39-f08a-40f2-ba24-3c0eedfd2306", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7005cf462b5e32523bd31739624df80cc98be2f10bb2bbfa6f279fbba738e6be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d191238b18ce6b099326ae7dad07178d8f79ff972572694dcb4d56d81f2cfbce", "text": "As a result, whether ornot the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligationsof GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors)would be treated differently from, and could receive, ifanything, substantially less than, the depositors of GS BankUSA.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime\n(known as OLA) for BHCs and their affiliates that aresystemically important and certain non-bank financialcompanies.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSubstantial differences in the rights of creditors exist\nbetween OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including theright of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priorityof creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of anadministrative claims procedure to determine creditors\u2019claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized inbankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC totransfer claims to a \u201cbridge\u201d entity. In addition, OLA limitsthe ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership.The FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve afailed FHC by transferring its assets to a \u201cbridge\u201d holdingcompany under its \u201csingle point of entry\u201d or \u201cSPOE\u201dstrategy pursuant to OLA.\nDeposit Insurance. Deposits at GS Bank USA have the\nbenefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. TheFDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments oninsured depository institutions. GS Bank USA\u2019s assessment(subject to adjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on itsaverage total consolidated assets less its average tangibleequity during the assessment period, its supervisory ratingsand specified forward-looking financial measures used tocalculate the assessment rate. In addition, deposits at GSIBare covered by the Financial Services Compensation Schemeup to the applicable limits.\nPrompt Corrective Action. The U.S. Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA)requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take\u201cprompt corrective action\u201d in respect of depositoryinstitutions that do not meet specified capital requirements.FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insuredbanks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequatelycapitalized, undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized\nand critically undercapitalized.\nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a\ncapital category that is lower than is indicated by its capitalratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsoundcondition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examinationrating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposesprogressively more restrictive constraints on operations,management and capital distributions, as the capitalcategory of an institution declines. Failure to meet thecapital requirements could also require a depositoryinstitution to raise capital. Ultimately, criticallyundercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointmentof a receiver or conservator, as described in \u201cInsolvency ofan Insured Depository Institution or a Bank HoldingCompany\u201d above.The prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to\nBHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriateaction at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalizedstatus of the BHC\u2019s depository institution subsidiaries. Incertain instances relating to an undercapitalized depositoryinstitution subsidiary, the BHC would be required toguarantee the performance of the undercapitalizedsubsidiary\u2019s capital restoration plan and might be liable forcivil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitmentson that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of thebankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priorityover the BHC\u2019s general unsecured creditors, as described in\u201cSource of Strength\u201d above.\nVolcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities. As a\nBHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of businessactivities we may engage in.\nVolcker Rule. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act\nreferred to as the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d became effective inJuly 2015. The Volcker Rule prohibits \u201cproprietarytrading,\u201d but permits activities such as underwriting,market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires anextensive compliance program and includes additionalreporting and record-keeping requirements.\nIn addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and\ninvestment in, \u201ccovered funds\u201d (as defined in the rule) bybanking entities, including us. It also limits certain types oftransactions between us and our sponsored funds, similarto the limitations on transactions between depositoryinstitutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include ourprivate equity funds, certain of our credit and real estatefunds, our hedge funds and certain other investmentstructures. The limitation on investments in covered fundsrequires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3%or less of the fund\u2019s net asset value, and to limit ouraggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of ourTier 1 capital.\nThe FRB has extended the conformance period to July 2022\nfor our investments in, and relationships with, certainlegacy \u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as defined in the Volcker Rule) thatwere in place prior to December 2013.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4776, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18bccfc6-e511-4ac9-8ace-3e07003052b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "18bccfc6-e511-4ac9-8ace-3e07003052b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9bbc0bbe-9732-4cd3-b563-ecfa140e2f23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "14f89f964dd71683b7ead0092967407d048b3806b5eb427c78c81ef38c389be8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "81295b39-f08a-40f2-ba24-3c0eedfd2306", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "7005cf462b5e32523bd31739624df80cc98be2f10bb2bbfa6f279fbba738e6be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b4d4112-3500-4c2c-a938-fd111b330cec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5732c1a68160721f243f9f7053f1d9c25cbd0826d1e82611476bf4b6f1f45ec6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1ff92f3bd054980bef56e62495064683b30ba5f26ca2b58546ef0b940af69d6c", "text": "It also limits certain types oftransactions between us and our sponsored funds, similarto the limitations on transactions between depositoryinstitutions and their affiliates.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn July 2018, the FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFTC and SEC issued\na notice of proposed rulemaking intended to amend theapplication of the Volcker Rule based on the size and scopeof a banking entity\u2019s trading activities and to clarify andamend certain definitions, requirements and exemptions.The ultimate impact of any amendments to the VolckerRule will depend on, among other things, furtherrulemaking and implementation guidance from the relevantU.S. federal regulatory agencies and the development ofmarket practices and standards.\nOther Restrictions. FHCs generally can engage in a\nbroader range of financial and related activities than areotherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue tomeet the eligibility requirements for FHCs. The broaderrange of permissible activities for FHCs includesunderwriting, dealing and making markets in securities andmaking investments in non-FHCs (merchant bankingactivities). In addition, certain FHCs are permitted toengage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. thatmay otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as theassets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% ormore of their consolidated assets.\nThe FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC\u2019s\nability to conduct activities that would otherwise bepermissible, and will likely do so if the FHC does notsatisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. Forexample, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institutionsubsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalizedor well-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capitaland/or managerial requirements, as well as additionallimitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHCmay be required to divest its U.S. depository institutionsubsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than thebusiness of banking and certain closely related activities.\nIf any insured depository institution subsidiary of an FHC\nfails to maintain at least a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating under theCommunity Reinvestment Act, the FHC would be subjectto restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions.\nIn addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval\nbefore engaging in certain banking and other financialactivities both within and outside the U.S.In September 2016, the FRB issued a proposed rule which,\nif adopted, would impose new requirements on the physicalcommodity activities and certain merchant bankingactivities of FHCs. The proposed rule would, among otherthings, (i) require FHCs to hold additional capital inconnection with covered physical commodity activities,including merchant banking investments in companiesengaged in physical commodity activities; (ii) tighten thequantitative limits on permissible physical trading activity;and (iii) establish new public reporting requirements on thenature and extent of an FHC\u2019s physical commodityholdings and activities. In addition, in a September 2016report, the FRB recommended that Congress repeal (i) theauthority of FHCs to engage in merchant banking activities;and (ii) the authority described above for certain FHCs toengage in certain otherwise permissible commoditiesactivities.\nIn June 2018, the FRB issued a final rule regarding single\ncounterparty credit limits, which imposes more stringentrequirements for credit exposures among major financialinstitutions. The final rule requires U.S. G-SIBs, such as us,to comply by January 1, 2020. In addition, the FRB hasproposed early remediation requirements, which aremodeled on the prompt corrective action regime, describedin \u201cPrompt Corrective Action\u201d above, but are designed torequire action to begin in earlier stages of a company\u2019sfinancial distress, based on a range of triggers, includingcapital and leverage, stress test results, liquidity and riskmanagement.\nIn addition, New York State banking law imposes lending\nlimits (which take into account credit exposure fromderivative transactions) and other requirements that couldimpact the manner and scope of GS Bank USA\u2019s activities.\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued\nguidance that focuses on transaction structures and riskmanagement frameworks and that outlines high-levelprinciples for safe-and-sound leveraged lending, includingunderwriting standards, valuation and stress testing.

InDecember 2016, the CFTC proposed revised capitalregulations for swap dealers that are not subject to thecapital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB, aswell as a liquidity requirement for those swap dealers.\nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-\nbased swap dealers but compliance with such rules is notcurrently required.

The rules for variation margin have becomeeffective, and those for initial margin will phase in throughSeptember 2020 depending on certain activity levels of theswap dealer and the relevant counterparty. In contrast tothe FRB margin rules, inter-affiliate transactions under theCFTC margin rules are generally exempt from initialmargin requirements.\nThe CFTC has proposed position limit rules that will limit\nthe size of positions in physical commodity derivatives thatcan be held by any entity, or any group of affiliates or otherparties trading under common control, subject to certainexemptions, such as for bona fide hedging positions. Theseproposed rules would apply to positions in swaps, as well asfutures and options on futures.\nSimilar types of swap regulation have been proposed or\nadopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in theE.U. and Japan.

Thescope and content of compensation regulation in thefinancial industry are continuing to develop, and we expectthat these regulations and resulting market practices willevolve over a number of years.The FSB has released standards for local regulators to\nimplement certain compensation principles for banks andother financial companies designed to encourage soundcompensation practices. The U.S. federal bank regulatoryagencies have provided guidance designed to ensure thatincentive compensation arrangements at bankingorganizations take into account risk and are consistent withsafe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth thefollowing three key principles with respect to incentivecompensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements shouldprovide employees with incentives that appropriatelybalance risk and financial results in a manner that does notencourage employees to expose their organizations toimprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatiblewith effective controls and risk management; and (iii) thearrangements should be supported by strong corporategovernance. The guidance provides that supervisoryfindings with respect to incentive compensation will beincorporated, as appropriate, into the organization\u2019ssupervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to makeacquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance alsoprovides that enforcement actions may be taken against abanking organization if its incentive compensationarrangements or related risk management, control orgovernance processes pose a risk to the organization\u2019ssafety and soundness.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators,\nincluding the FRB and SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entitieshaving at least $1 billion in total assets (including GroupInc. and some of its depository institution, broker-dealerand investment adviser subsidiaries). The U.S. financialregulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have notbeen finalized.\nIn October 2016, the NYDFS issued guidance emphasizing\nthat its regulated banking institutions, including GS BankUSA, must ensure that any incentive compensationarrangements tied to employee performance indicators aresubject to effective risk management, oversight and control.\nIn the E.U., the CRR and CRD IV include compensation\nprovisions designed to implement the FSB\u2019s compensationstandards. These rules have been implemented by E.U.member states and, among other things, limit the ratio ofvariable to fixed compensation of certain employees,including those identified as having a material impact onthe risk profile of E.U.-regulated entities, including GSI.\nThe E.U. has also introduced rules regulating compensation\nfor certain persons providing services to certain investmentfunds. These requirements are in addition to the guidanceissued by U.S. financial regulators described above and theDodd-Frank Act provision described above.\n18 Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5236, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5470cb79-53d1-4b78-a4fd-1b2315d5620d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5470cb79-53d1-4b78-a4fd-1b2315d5620d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a2bc4b8-cfb7-4b8a-a335-38aac2963bd8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "43b6d0c81ee87559f779ac2c23cbc0033b6765f5b4a2b521821d3d0a8d9ee560", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "83d328f5-89f0-4b55-bb8b-a01da1854a77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9b4ef234777987de7aa4aa5287722a8898c20ca774075fe773a9768f9b4df7c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "40be9d09-175c-4aeb-abe7-a4104360beef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "86b14d550d8661bbfc409c76d0f2b0e049859e257eaa9224e391c73425565a9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e3636350062aa6fc3e6b7b928cc7a5c9cca20bc10cb8d324788b78d4bc113aed", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Through these and other provisions,the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to promote theidentification of parties that may be involved in terrorism,money laundering or other suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the U.S. contain somesimilar provisions.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws and regulations\nworldwide, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt PracticesAct (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corruptand illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to,government officials and others. The scope of the types ofpayments or other benefits covered by these laws is verybroad and regulators are frequently using enforcementproceedings to define the scope of these laws. Theobligation of financial institutions, including GoldmanSachs, to identify their clients, to monitor for and reportsuspicious transactions, to monitor direct and indirectpayments to government officials, to respond to requestsfor information by regulatory authorities and lawenforcement agencies, and to share information with otherfinancial institutions, has required the implementation andmaintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.\nPrivacy and Cyber Security Regulation\nCertain of our businesses are subject to laws andregulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments,the E.U. or other non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or enacted byvarious regulatory organizations or exchanges relating tothe privacy of the information of clients, employees orothers, including the GLB Act, the E.U.\u2019s General DataProtection Regulation (GDPR) which took effect onMay 25, 2018, the Japanese Personal InformationProtection Act, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy)Ordinance, the Australian Privacy Act and the BrazilianBank Secrecy Law. The GDPR has heightened our privacycompliance obligations, impacted our businesses\u2019collection, processing and retention of personal data andimposed strict standards for reporting data breaches. TheGDPR also provides for significant penalties fornon-compliance. In addition, the California ConsumerPrivacy Act (CCPA) was enacted in June 2018 and isscheduled to take effect on January 1, 2020 and will imposeprivacy compliance obligations with regard to the personalinformation of California residents.The NYDFS also requires financial institutions regulated by\nthe NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, to, among otherthings, (i) establish and maintain a cyber security programdesigned to ensure the confidentiality, integrity andavailability of their information systems; (ii) implement andmaintain a written cyber security policy setting forthpolicies and procedures for the protection of theirinformation systems and nonpublic information; and(iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer. Inaddition, in October 2016, the U.S. federal bank regulatoryagencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemakingon potential enhanced cyber risk management standards forlarge financial institutions.\nOther Regulation\nU.S. and non-U.S. government agencies, regulatory bodiesand self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securitiescommissions and other state regulators in the U.S., areempowered to conduct administrative proceedings that canresult in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desistorders, or the suspension or expulsion of a regulated entityor its directors, officers or employees.

Risk Factors\nWe face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherentin our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit,operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risks. Thefollowing are some of the more important factors thatcould affect our businesses.\nOur businesses have been and may continue to be\nadversely affected by conditions in the globalfinancial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable\nearnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected byconditions in the global financial markets and economicconditions generally, both directly and through their impacton client activity levels. These conditions can changesuddenly and negatively.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the\nenvironment in which our businesses operate. A favorablebusiness environment is generally characterized by, amongother factors, high global gross domestic product growth,regulatory and market conditions which result intransparent, liquid and efficient capital markets, lowinflation, high business and investor confidence, stablegeopolitical conditions, clear regulations and strongbusiness earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic andmarket conditions can be caused by: concerns aboutsovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal ormonetary policy, government shutdowns, debt ceilings orfunding; the extent of and uncertainty about tax and otherregulatory changes; declines in economic growth, businessactivity or investor or business confidence; limitations onthe availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital;illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates,exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or defaultrates; the imposition of tariffs or other limitations oninternational trade and travel; outbreaks of domestic orinternational tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclearproliferation, cybersecurity threats or attacks and otherforms of disruption to or curtailment of globalcommunication, energy transmission or transportationnetworks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty,such as Brexit; corporate, political or other scandals thatreduce investor confidence in capital markets; extremeweather events or other natural disasters or pandemics; or acombination of these or other factors.\n22 Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5190, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9ab40d6-a198-4969-9c26-63c91789ef6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9ab40d6-a198-4969-9c26-63c91789ef6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "661a82c2-90f8-494b-bcef-03e3b56af64f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "df4e2471bd7abcf56fb4aa225acdf111946270cbbb23e3025549fcd0cc39f1be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "41f122e8-d628-48a9-b16a-3719e024e2ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c3a1e5db1c65f1237f10eee847cf825f35b2cb04f3c847f3619c03fe4154ff34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "899170d3-51a0-4e0b-a34b-1ff8acfc9e2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b01b54fba0ffbd8954c00fcb65c708b209c6e2fa1201187fbf6898af7766b783", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0de30da0f2cd50e1c885b2e998f4cf1a55c1e970b227fe9371c6cce00022c1de", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition, concernsabout European sovereign debt risk and its impact on theEuropean banking system, the impact of Brexit, theimposition of tariffs by the U.S. and by other countries inresponse thereto, and changes in interest rates and othermarket conditions or actual changes in interest rates andother market conditions, have resulted, at times, insignificant volatility while negatively impacting the levels ofclient activity.\nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market\nactivities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatoryreform, as well as weak consumer, investor and CEOconfidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty,continues to negatively impact client activity, whichadversely affects many of our businesses. Periods of lowvolatility and periods of high volatility combined with alack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable impacton our market-making businesses.\nFinancial institution returns in many countries may be\nnegatively impacted by increased funding costs due in partto the lack of perceived government support of suchinstitutions in the event of future financial crises relative tofinancial institutions in countries in which governmentalsupport is maintained. In addition, liquidity in the financialmarkets has also been negatively impacted as marketparticipants and market practices and structures continueto adjust to new regulations.\nOur revenues and profitability and those of our competitors\nhave been and will continue to be impacted by requirementsrelating to capital, additional loss-absorbing capacity,leverage, minimum liquidity and long-term funding levels,requirements related to resolution and recovery planning,derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels ofregulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, ifpermitted, how certain business activities may be carriedout by financial institutions.The degree to which these and other changes since the\nfinancial crisis continue to have an impact on theprofitability of financial institutions will depend on theeffect of regulations adopted after 2008 and newregulations, the manner in which markets, marketparticipants and financial institutions have continued toadapt to these regulations, and the prevailing economic andfinancial market conditions. However, there is a significantrisk that such changes will negatively impact the absolutelevel of revenues, profitability and return on equity for usand other financial institutions.\nOur businesses and those of our clients are subject to\nextensive and pervasive regulation around the world.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry and a\nsystemically important financial institution, we are subjectto extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world.We face the risk of significant intervention by lawenforcement, regulatory and taxing authorities, as well asprivate litigation, in all jurisdictions in which we conductour businesses. In many cases, our activities may be subjectto overlapping and divergent regulation in differentjurisdictions.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIncreasingly, regulators and courts have sought to hold\nfinancial institutions liable for the misconduct of theirclients where such regulators and courts have determinedthat the financial institution should have detected that theclient was engaged in wrongdoing, even though thefinancial institution had no direct knowledge of theactivities engaged in by its client. Regulators and courtshave also increasingly found liability as a \u201ccontrol person\u201dfor activities of entities in which financial institutions orfunds controlled by financial institutions have aninvestment, but which they do not actively manage. Inaddition, regulators and courts continue to seek to establish\u201cfiduciary\u201d obligations to counterparties to which no suchduty had been assumed to exist. To the extent that suchefforts are successful, the cost of, and liabilities associatedwith, engaging in brokerage, clearing, market-making,prime brokerage, investing and other similar activitiescould increase significantly. To the extent that we havefiduciary obligations in connection with acting as afinancial adviser, investment adviser or in other roles forindividual, institutional, sovereign or investment fundclients, any breach, or even an alleged breach, of suchobligations could have materially negative legal, regulatoryand reputational consequences.\nFor information about the extensive regulation to which\nour businesses are subject, see \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d inPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nOur businesses have been and may be adversely\naffected by declining asset values. This is particularlytrue for those businesses in which we have net \u201clong\u201dpositions, receive fees based on the value of assetsmanaged, or receive or post collateral.\nMany of our businesses have net \u201clong\u201d positions in debt\nsecurities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities (includingprivate equity and real estate) and most other asset classes.These include positions we take when we act as a principalto facilitate our clients\u2019 activities, including our exchange-based market-making activities, or commit large amountsof capital to maintain positions in interest rate and creditproducts, as well as through our currencies, commodities,equities and mortgage-related activities. In addition, weinvest in similar asset classes. Substantially all of ourinvesting and market-making positions and a portion of ourloans are marked-to-market on a daily basis and declines inasset values directly and immediately impact our earnings,unless we have effectively \u201chedged\u201d our exposures to suchdeclines.In certain circumstances (particularly in the case of credit\nproducts, including leveraged loans, and private equities orother securities that are not freely tradable or lackestablished and liquid trading markets), it may not bepossible or economic to hedge such exposures and to theextent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or maygreatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in thevalues of the assets. Sudden declines and significantvolatility in the prices of assets may substantially curtail oreliminate the trading markets for certain assets, which maymake it difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. Theinability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our abilityto limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuingassets may negatively affect our capital, liquidity or leverageratios, increase our funding costs and generally require us tomaintain additional capital.\nIn our exchange-based market-making activities, we are\nobligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderlymarket, including by purchasing securities in a decliningmarket. In markets where asset values are declining and involatile markets, this results in losses and an increased needfor liquidity.\nWe receive asset-based management fees based on the value\nof our clients\u2019 portfolios or investment in funds managed byus and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees basedon increases in the value of such investments. Declines inasset values reduce the value of our clients\u2019 portfolios orfund assets, which in turn reduce the fees we earn formanaging such assets.\nWe post collateral to support our obligations and receive\ncollateral to support the obligations of our clients andcounterparties in connection with our client executionbusinesses. When the value of the assets posted as collateralor the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline,the party posting the collateral may need to provideadditional collateral or, if possible, reduce its tradingposition. An example of such a situation is a \u201cmargin call\u201din connection with a brokerage account. Therefore, declinesin the value of asset classes used as collateral mean thateither the cost of funding positions is increased or the size ofpositions is decreased.\nIf we are the party providing collateral, this can increase our\ncosts and reduce our profitability and if we are the partyreceiving collateral, this can also reduce our profitability byreducing the level of business done with our clients andcounterparties.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5099, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96f4828b-77f2-4b5b-beea-e21ea75edb7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "96f4828b-77f2-4b5b-beea-e21ea75edb7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0592f12a-606c-441f-a65e-88131187bd72", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "40733cd8cca3f9fdcd9504bf7d4a802b98ea3d4e44a3a9cc116762c206c74f6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9610a5dc-b9c6-42de-a721-e50fc271bab7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b003aa1380f726b90fcb6290a957e531a28767f7860ba51bc7c856c925b87cd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d8b9c6b-bb14-4c0f-8744-36986f579ebb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "abe63cb208ef2f4fae67eec6d4798cf757ac314abe8c582e1be8f1ad95cd1e87", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "59e859b8a14a87767dfda4471864cf2d879b48ec307f70fdbdc20f6c9d5864f4", "text": "We post collateral to support our obligations and receive\ncollateral to support the obligations of our clients andcounterparties in connection with our client executionbusinesses.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn cases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in\nthe value or liquidity of such collateral may, despite creditmonitoring, over-collateralization, the ability to call foradditional collateral or the ability to force repayment of theunderlying obligation, result in significant losses to us,especially where there is a single type of collateralsupporting the obligation. In addition, we have been, andmay in the future be, subject to claims that the foreclosurewas not permitted under the legal documents, wasconducted in an improper manner or caused a client orcounterparty to go out of business.\nOur businesses have been and may be adversely\naffected by disruptions in the credit markets,including reduced access to credit and higher costs ofobtaining credit.\nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in\nthe availability of credit, have in the past adversely affectedour ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis andmay do so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecuredbasis by issuing long-term debt, by accepting deposits at ourbank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instrumentsor by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial orother banking entities. We seek to finance many of ourassets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the creditmarkets may make it harder and more expensive to obtainfunding for our businesses. If our available funding islimited or we are forced to fund our operations at a highercost, these conditions may require us to curtail our businessactivities and increase our cost of funding, both of whichcould reduce our profitability, particularly in our businessesthat involve investing, lending and market making.\nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other\ntypes of strategic transactions often rely on access to thesecured and unsecured credit markets to finance theirtransactions. A lack of available credit or an increased costof credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing ofour clients\u2019 merger and acquisition transactions,particularly large transactions, and adversely affect ourfinancial advisory and underwriting businesses.\nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be\nnegatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. Alack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases pricevolatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all ofwhich can increase transaction risk or decrease theprofitability of such businesses.Our market-making activities have been and may be\naffected by changes in the levels of market volatility.\nCertain of our market-making activities depend on market\nvolatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities toour clients, and decreases in volatility have reduced andmay in the future reduce these opportunities and the level ofclient activity associated with them and adversely affect theresults of these activities. On the other hand, increasedvolatility, while it can increase trading volumes andspreads, also increases risk as measured by Value-at-Risk(VaR) and may expose us to increased risks in connectionwith our market-making activities or cause us to reduce ourmarket-making inventory in order to avoid increasing ourVaR. Limiting the size of our market-making positions canadversely affect our profitability. In periods when volatilityis increasing, but asset values are declining significantly, itmay not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only bepossible to do so at steep discounts. In such circumstanceswe may be forced to either take on additional risk or torealize losses in order to decrease our VaR.

This could affect themanagement and incentive fees that we earn on assets undersupervision or the commissions and net spreads that weearn for selling other investment products, such asstructured notes or derivatives. To the extent that ourclients choose to invest in products that we do not currentlyoffer, we will suffer outflows and a loss of managementfees. Further, if, due to changes in investor sentiment or therelative performance of certain asset classes or otherwise,clients invest in products that generate lower fees, ourinvestment management business could be adverselyaffected.\nWe may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk\nmanagement processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through\na risk and control framework encompassing a variety ofseparate but complementary financial, credit, operational,compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls,management review processes and other mechanisms. Ourrisk management process seeks to balance our ability toprofit from market-making, investing or lending positions,and underwriting activities, with our exposure to potentiallosses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of riskmonitoring and risk mitigation techniques, thosetechniques and the judgments that accompany theirapplication cannot anticipate every economic and financialoutcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes.Thus, we may, in the course of our activities, incur losses.Market conditions in recent years have involvedunprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitationsinherent in using historical data to manage risk.The models that we use to assess and control our risk\nexposures reflect assumptions about the degrees ofcorrelation or lack thereof among prices of various assetclasses or other market indicators. In times of market stressor other unforeseen circumstances, such as those thatoccurred during 2008 and early 2009, and to some extentsince 2011, previously uncorrelated indicators may becomecorrelated, or conversely previously correlated indicatorsmay move in different directions. These types of marketmovements have at times limited the effectiveness of ourhedging strategies and have caused us to incur significantlosses, and they may do so in the future. These changes incorrelation can be exacerbated where other marketparticipants are using risk or trading models withassumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In theseand other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our riskpositions due to the activity of other market participants orwidespread market dislocations, including circumstanceswhere asset values are declining significantly or no marketexists for certain assets.\nIn addition, the use of models in connection with risk\nmanagement and numerous other critical activities presentsrisks that such models may be ineffective, either because ofpoor design or ineffective testing, improper or flawedinputs, as well as unpermitted access to such modelsresulting in unapproved or malicious changes to the modelor its inputs.\nTo the extent that we have positions through our market-\nmaking or origination activities or we make investmentsdirectly through our investing activities, including privateequity, that do not have an established liquid tradingmarket or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale orhedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions andtherefore reduce our risk associated with such positions.

It is of critical\nimportance to us, as most of the failures of financialinstitutions have occurred in large part due to insufficientliquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability toaccess secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inabilityto access funds from our subsidiaries or otherwise allocateliquidity optimally, an inability to sell assets or redeem ourinvestments, or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral.This situation may arise due to circumstances that we maybe unable to control, such as a general market disruption oran operational problem that affects third parties or us, oreven by the perception among market participants that we,or other market participants, are experiencing greaterliquidity risk.\nWe employ structured products to benefit our clients and\nhedge our own risks. The financial instruments that wehold and the contracts to which we are a party are oftencomplex, and these complex structured products often donot have readily available markets to access in times ofliquidity stress. Our investing and lending activities maylead to situations where the holdings from these activitiesrepresent a significant portion of specific markets, whichcould restrict liquidity for our positions.\nFurther, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is\nnot generally a liquid market for such assets, as well as incircumstances where other market participants are seekingto sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the sametime, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisisor in response to changes to rules or regulations. Inaddition, financial institutions with which we interact mayexercise set-off rights or the right to require additionalcollateral, including in difficult market conditions, whichcould further impair our liquidity.Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A\nreduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect ourliquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowingcosts, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger ourobligations under certain provisions in some of our tradingand collateralized financing contracts. Under theseprovisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminatecontracts with us or require us to post additional collateral.Termination of our trading and collateralized financingcontracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair ourliquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financingor to make significant cash payments or securitiesmovements.\nAs of December 2018, our counterparties could have called\nfor additional collateral or termination payments related toour net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in anaggregate amount of $262 million in the event of aone-notch downgrade of our credit ratings and$959 million in the event of a two-notch downgrade of ourcredit ratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency,depending on the agency\u2019s relative ratings of us at the timeof the downgrade, may have an impact which iscomparable to the impact of a downgrade by all ratingagencies. For further information about our credit ratings,see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations \u2014 RiskManagement \u2014 Liquidity Risk Management \u2014 CreditRatings\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nOur cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is\ndirectly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excessof the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities (or otherbenchmark securities) of the same maturity that we need topay to our debt investors). Increases in our credit spreadscan significantly increase our cost of this funding. Changesin credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subjectat times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements.Our credit spreads are also influenced by marketperceptions of our creditworthiness. In addition, our creditspreads may be influenced by movements in the costs topurchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEnhancements and updates to systems, as well as the\nrequisite training, including in connection with theintegration of new businesses, entail significant costs andcreate risks associated with implementing new systems andintegrating them with existing ones.\nThe use of computing devices and phones is critical to the\nwork done by our employees and the operation of oursystems and businesses and those of our clients and ourthird-party service providers and vendors. Fundamentalsecurity flaws in computer chips found in many types ofthese computing devices and phones have been reported inthe past and may be discovered in the future. Addressingthis and similar issues could be costly and affect theperformance of these businesses and systems, andoperational risks may be incurred in applying fixes andthere may still be residual security risks.\nAdditionally, although the prevalence and scope of\napplications of distributed ledger technology and similartechnologies is growing, the technology is also nascent andmay be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other inherentweaknesses. We may be, or may become, exposed to risksrelated to distributed ledger technology through ourfacilitation of clients\u2019 activities involving financial productslinked to distributed ledger technology, such as blockchainor cryptocurrencies, our investments in companies that seekto develop platforms based on distributed ledgertechnology, and the use of distributed ledger technology bythird-party vendors, clients, counterparties, clearing housesand other financial intermediaries.\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of technology and\ntechnology-based risk and control systems, our businessesultimately rely on people as our greatest resource, and,from time-to-time, they make mistakes or engage inviolations of applicable policies, laws, rules or proceduresthat are not always caught immediately by ourtechnological processes or by our controls and otherprocedures, which are intended to prevent and detect sucherrors or violations. These can include calculation errors,mistakes in addressing emails, errors in software or modeldevelopment or implementation, or simple errors injudgment, as well as intentional efforts to ignore orcircumvent applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures.Human errors and malfeasance, even if promptlydiscovered and remediated, can result in material losses andliabilities for us.\nIn addition, we face the risk of operational failure or\nsignificant operational delay, termination or capacityconstraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitateour securities and derivatives transactions, and as ourinterconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly facethe risk of operational failure or significant operational delaywith respect to our clients\u2019 systems.In recent years, there has been significant consolidation\namong clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses andan increasing number of derivative transactions are now orin the near future will be cleared on exchanges, which hasincreased our exposure to operational failure or significantoperational delay, termination or capacity constraints ofthe particular financial intermediaries that we use andcould affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effectivealternatives in the event of any such failure, delay,termination or constraint. Industry consolidation, whetheramong market participants or financial intermediaries,increases the risk of operational failure or significantoperational delay as disparate complex systems need to beintegrated, often on an accelerated basis.\nFurthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial\ninstitutions with central agents, exchanges and clearinghouses, and the increased centrality of these entities,increases the risk that an operational failure at oneinstitution or entity may cause an industry-wideoperational failure that could materially impact our abilityto conduct business. Any such failure, termination orconstraint could adversely affect our ability to effecttransactions, service our clients, manage our exposure torisk or expand our businesses or result in financial loss orliability to our clients, impairment of our liquidity,disruption of our businesses, regulatory intervention orreputational damage.\nDespite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place,\nour ability to conduct business may be adversely impactedby a disruption in the infrastructure that supports ourbusinesses and the communities in which we are located.This may include a disruption involving electrical, satellite,undersea cable or other communications, internet,transportation or other services facilities used by us, ouremployees or third parties with which we conduct business,including cloud service providers.

It is possible that the applicationof the single point of entry strategy under OLA, in whichGroup Inc. would be the only entity to enter resolutionproceedings (and its material broker-dealer, bank and otheroperating entities would not enter resolution proceedings),would result in greater losses to Group Inc.\u2019s securityholders (including holders of our fixed rate, floating rateand indexed debt securities), than the losses that wouldresult from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or adifferent resolution strategy, such as a multiple point ofentry resolution strategy for Group Inc. and certain of itsmaterial subsidiaries.\nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution proceedings and\nthat support from Group Inc. to its subsidiaries wassufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent, lossesat the subsidiary level would be transferred to Group Inc.and ultimately borne by Group Inc.\u2019s security holders,third-party creditors of Group Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries wouldreceive full recoveries on their claims, and Group Inc.\u2019ssecurity holders (including our shareholders, debtholdersand other unsecured creditors) could face significant andpossibly complete losses.

In exchange for an unsecuredsubordinated funding note and equity interest, Group Inc.transferred certain intercompany receivables andsubstantially all of its global core liquid assets (GCLA) toFunding IHC, and agreed to transfer additional GCLAabove prescribed thresholds.We also put in place a Capital and Liquidity Support\nAgreement (CLSA) among Group Inc., Funding IHC andour major subsidiaries.

Inall cases, any payments to debtholders are dependent onour ability to make such payments and are therefore subjectto our credit risk.\nAs a result of our recovery and resolution planning\nprocesses, including incorporating feedback from ourregulators, we may incur increased operational, funding orother costs and face limitations on our ability to structureour internal organization or engage in internal or externalactivities in a manner that we may otherwise deem mostoperationally efficient.\nOur businesses, profitability and liquidity may be\nadversely affected by Brexit.\nIn March 2017, the U.K. notified the European Council of\nits decision to leave the E.U. (Brexit). As discussed in\u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of thisForm 10-K there is considerable uncertainty as to theregulatory framework that will govern transactions andbusiness undertaken by our U.K. subsidiaries in the E.U.,both in the near term and the long term. As a result, we facenumerous risks that could adversely affect how we conductour businesses or our profitability and liquidity.\nOur principal E.U. operating subsidiaries, GSI, GSIB and\nGSAMI, are incorporated and headquartered in the U.K.They all currently benefit from non-discriminatory accessto E.U. clients and infrastructure based on E.U. treaties andE.U. legislation, including arrangements for cross-border\u201cpassporting\u201d and the establishment of E.U. branches.Because the Withdrawal Agreement has not been ratified bythe U.K. and E.U. Parliaments, it is uncertain whether GSI,GSIB and GSAMI will continue to benefit from the existingaccess arrangements for financial services followingMarch 29, 2019, the date on which the U.K. is scheduled toleave the E.U. Further, even if the Withdrawal Agreement isratified, there is uncertainty regarding the terms of the long-term trading relationship between the E.U. and the U.K.,including the terms of access to each other\u2019s financialmarkets.In a hard Brexit scenario or as otherwise necessary, our\nGerman bank subsidiary, GSBE, will act as our mainoperating subsidiary in the E.U. and will assume certainfunctions that can no longer be efficiently and effectivelyperformed by our U.K. operating subsidiaries, includingGSI, GSIB and GSAMI. Implementing this strategy couldmaterially adversely affect the manner in which we operatecertain businesses in Europe, require us to restructurecertain of our operations and expose us to higheroperational, regulatory and compliance costs, higher taxes,higher subsidiary-level capital and liquidity requirements,additional restrictions on intercompany transactions, andnew restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to sharepersonal data, including client data, all of which couldadversely affect our liquidity and profitability.\nGSBE has not been one of our main operating subsidiaries\nin the E.U. Depending on the outcome, Brexit couldnecessitate a rapid and significant expansion in the scope ofGSBE\u2019s activities, as well as its headcount, balance sheet,and capital and funding needs. Although we have investedsignificant resources to plan for and address Brexit, therecan be no assurance that we will be able to successfullyexecute our strategy. In addition, even if we are able tosuccessfully execute our strategy, we face the risk thatBrexit could have a disproportionately adverse effect on ourE.U operations compared to some of our competitors whohave more extensive pre-existing operations in the E.U.outside of the U.K.\nIn addition, Brexit has created an uncertain political and\neconomic environment in the U.K., and may create suchenvironments in other E.U. member states.

While in many cases we are permitted to requireadditional collateral from counterparties that experiencefinancial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount ofcollateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledgedassets. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure oncollateral may subject us to claims for the improper exerciseof our rights.

The number and size of such transactionsmay affect our results of operations in a given period.Moreover, because of concentration of risk, we may sufferlosses even when economic and market conditions aregenerally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in thecredit markets can make it difficult to hedge these creditexposures effectively or economically. In addition, weextend large commitments as part of our credit originationactivities.Rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar rules\nadopted in other jurisdictions, require issuers of certainasset-backed securities and any person who organizes andinitiates certain asset-backed securities transactions toretain economic exposure to the asset, which has affectedthe cost of and structures used in connection with thesesecuritization activities. Our inability to reduce our creditrisk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions,including during periods of market stress, could negativelyaffect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fairvalue of the positions, including due to the insolvency orbankruptcy of the borrower, as well as the loss of revenuesassociated with selling such securities or loans.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a\nconcentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,borrower, issuer, including sovereign issuers, or geographicarea or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and afailure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity couldnegatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, andthe systems by which we set limits and monitor the level ofour credit exposure to individual entities, industries andcountries may not function as we have anticipated.Regulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, has ledto increased centralization of trading activity throughparticular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges,which has significantly increased our concentration of riskwith respect to these entities. While our activities expose usto many different industries, counterparties and countries,we routinely execute a high volume of transactions withcounterparties engaged in financial services activities,including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, clearinghouses, exchanges and investment funds. This has resultedin significant credit concentration with respect to thesecounterparties.\nThe financial services industry is both highly\ncompetitive and interrelated.\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are\nintensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Wecompete on the basis of a number of factors, includingtransaction execution, our products and services,innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price. Therehas been substantial consolidation and convergence amongcompanies in the financial services industry. Thisconsolidation and convergence has hastened theglobalization of the securities and other financial servicesmarkets.

For example, we have a smallercorporate client base in our market-making businesses thanmany of our peers and therefore such competitors maybenefit more from increased activity by corporate clients.\nDerivative transactions and delayed settlements may\nexpose us to unexpected risk and potential losses.\nWe are party to a large number of derivative transactions,\nincluding credit derivatives. Many of these derivativeinstruments are individually negotiated andnon-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring orsettling positions difficult. Many credit derivatives requirethat we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security,loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In anumber of cases, we do not hold the underlying security,loan or other obligation and may not be able to obtain theunderlying security, loan or other obligation. This couldcause us to forfeit the payments due to us under thesecontracts or result in settlement delays with the attendantcredit and operational risk, as well as increased costs to us.\nDerivative transactions may also involve the risk that\ndocumentation has not been properly executed, thatexecuted agreements may not be enforceable against thecounterparty, or that obligations under such agreementsmay not be able to be \u201cnetted\u201d against other obligationswith such counterparty. In addition, counterparties mayclaim that such transactions were not appropriate orauthorized.\nAs a signatory to the ISDA Protocols and being subject to the\nFRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s rules on QFCs and similar rules in otherjurisdictions, we may not be able to exercise remedies againstcounterparties and, as this new regime has not yet beentested, we may suffer risks or losses that we would not haveexpected to suffer if we could immediately close outtransactions upon a termination event. Various non-U.S.regulators have also proposed regulations contemplated bythe ISDA Universal Protocol, and those implementingregulations may result in additional limitations on our abilityto exercise remedies against counterparties. The impact ofthe ISDA Protocols and these rules and regulations willdepend on the development of market practices andstructures, and they extend to repurchase agreements andother instruments that are not derivative contracts.Derivative contracts and other transactions, includingsecondary bank loan purchases and sales, entered into withthird parties are not always confirmed by the counterpartiesor settled on a timely basis. While the transaction remainsunconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subjectto heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of adefault may find it more difficult to enforce our rights.\nIn addition, as new complex derivative products arecreated, covering a wider array of underlying credit andother instruments, disputes about the terms of theunderlying contracts could arise, which could impair ourability to effectively manage our risk exposures from theseproducts and subject us to increased costs. The provisionsof the Dodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing of creditderivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a market shifttoward standardized derivatives, could reduce the riskassociated with such transactions, but under certaincircumstances could also limit our ability to developderivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and tohedge our own risks, and could adversely affect ourprofitability and increase our credit exposure to centralclearing platforms.\nCertain of our businesses, our funding and financial\nproducts may be adversely affected by changes in orthe discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates(IBORs), in particular LIBOR.\nThe FCA, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it\nwill not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after2021. It is likely that banks will not continue to providesubmissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 andpossibly prior to then. Similarly, it is not possible to knowwhether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptablemarket benchmark, what rate or rates may becomeaccepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of anysuch changes in views or alternatives may have on thefinancial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.Similar statements have been made with respect to otherIBORs.\n38 Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4706, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c909acb-2079-400d-930d-4baae26f36c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c909acb-2079-400d-930d-4baae26f36c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "396552b1-fe61-4fe1-8d2e-2c17b6364233", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8f3807f8f35e7e40e479e2be3d3f25ac316c887de0f77e882b1de03a75615a56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "73ebb751-c1e9-4a00-a2f7-d7823c17cac3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e52d831f4da3780310b2dffe1ebf67134c1a55fa3152a5fc03ecadc4b5b769d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1bdc957-5f2b-4729-a3ab-194dca55e154", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "17e1a4434d0b91443520da8714bf811ef216f40ced1115611b9c335ca1f3bed4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3ea8618f41ec9f64f9bdc13fa4f32b28d4cb869bbf206419f6be3b0650bb269a", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition,uncertainty relating to IBORs could result in increasedcapital requirements for the firm given potential lowtransaction volumes, a lack of liquidity or limitedobservability for exposures linked to IBORs or anyemerging successor rates and operational incidentsassociated with changes in and the discontinuance ofIBORs.\nThe language in our contracts and financial instruments\nthat define IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have developedover time and may have various events that trigger when asuccessor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If atrigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments maygive the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion overthe successor rate or benchmark to be selected. As a result,there is considerable uncertainty as to how the financialservices industry will address the discontinuance ofdesignated rates in contracts and financial instruments orsuch designated rates ceasing to be acceptable referencerates. This uncertainty could ultimately result in clientdisputes and litigation surrounding the properinterpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and financialinstruments.\nFurther, the discontinuation of an IBOR, changes in an\nIBOR or changes in market acceptance of any IBOR as areference rate may also adversely affect the yield on loans orsecurities held by us, amounts paid on securities we haveissued, amounts received and paid on derivativeinstruments we have entered into, the value of such loans,securities or derivative instruments, the trading market forsecurities, the terms of new loans being made usingdifferent or modified reference rates, our ability toeffectively use derivative instruments to manage risk, or theavailability or cost of our floating-rate funding and ourexposure to fluctuations in interest rates.Certain of our businesses and our funding may be\nadversely affected by changes in other referencerates, currencies, indexes, baskets or ETFs to whichproducts we offer or funding that we raise are linked.\nAll of our floating rate funding pays interest by reference to\nrates, such as LIBOR or Federal Funds. In addition, many ofthe products that we own or that we offer, such as structurednotes, warrants, swaps or security-based swaps, pay interestor determine the principal amount to be paid at maturity orin the event of default by reference to rates or by reference toan index, currency, basket, ETF or other financial metric (theunderlier). In the event that the composition of the underlieris significantly changed, by reference to rules governing suchunderlier or otherwise, the underlier ceases to exist (forexample, in the event that a country withdraws from theEuro or links its currency to or delinks its currency fromanother currency or benchmark, or an index or ETF sponsormaterially alters the composition of an index or ETF) or theunderlier ceases to be recognized as an acceptable marketbenchmark, we may experience adverse effects consistentwith those described above for IBORs.\nOur businesses may be adversely affected if we are\nunable to hire and retain qualified employees.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and\nefforts of highly skilled people; therefore, our continuedability to compete effectively in our businesses, to manageour businesses effectively and to expand into newbusinesses and geographic areas depends on our ability toattract new talented and diverse employees and to retainand motivate our existing employees. Factors that affectour ability to attract and retain such employees include thelevel and composition of our compensation and benefits,and our reputation as a successful business with a culture offairly hiring, training and promoting qualified employees.As a significant portion of the compensation that we pay toour employees is in the form of year-end discretionarycompensation, a significant portion of which is in the formof deferred equity-related awards, declines in ourprofitability, or in the outlook for our future profitability,as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels andterms, can negatively impact our ability to hire and retainhighly qualified employees.\nCompetition from within the financial services industry and\nfrom businesses outside the financial services industry,including the technology industry, for qualified employeeshas often been intense.

As a large globalfinancial and banking institution, we are subject tolimitations on compensation practices (which may or maynot affect our competitors) by the FRB, the PRA, the FCA,the FDIC and other regulators worldwide. Theselimitations, including any imposed by or as a result offuture legislation or regulation, may require us to alter ourcompensation practices in ways that could adversely affectour ability to attract and retain talented employees.\nWe may be adversely affected by increased\ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny or negativepublicity.\nGovernmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies\nand law enforcement agencies with respect to mattersrelating to compensation, our business practices, our pastactions and other matters has increased dramatically in thepast several years. The financial crisis and the currentpolitical and public sentiment regarding financialinstitutions has resulted in a significant amount of adversepress coverage, as well as adverse statements or charges byregulators or other government officials. Press coverage andother public statements that assert some form ofwrongdoing (including, in some cases, press coverage andpublic statements that do not directly involve us) oftenresult in some type of investigation by regulators, legislatorsand law enforcement officials or in lawsuits.\nResponding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless\nof the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effortof our senior management from our business. Penalties andfines sought by regulatory authorities have increasedsubstantially over the last several years, and certainregulators have been more likely in recent years tocommence enforcement actions or to advance or supportlegislation targeted at the financial services industry.Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and legal andenforcement proceedings can also have a negative impacton our reputation and on the morale and performance ofour employees, which could adversely affect our businessesand results of operations.Substantial civil or criminal liability or significant\nregulatory action against us could have materialadverse financial effects or cause us significantreputational harm, which in turn could seriously harmour business prospects.\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the\nvolume of claims and amount of damages and penaltiesclaimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings againstfinancial institutions remain high. See Notes 18 and 27 tothe consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 ofthis Form 10-K for information about certain legal andregulatory proceedings and investigations in which we areinvolved. Our experience has been that legal claims bycustomers and clients increase in a market downturn andthat employment-related claims increase following periodsin which we have reduced our headcount. Additionally,governmental entities have been and are plaintiffs in certainof the legal proceedings in which we are involved, and wemay face future civil or criminal actions or claims by thesame or other governmental entities, as well as follow-oncivil litigation that is often commenced after regulatorysettlements.\nSignificant settlements by several large financial\ninstitutions, including, in some cases, us, withgovernmental entities have been publicly announced. Thetrend of large settlements with governmental entities mayadversely affect the outcomes for other financialinstitutions in similar actions, especially wheregovernmental officials have announced that the largesettlements will be used as the basis or a template for othersettlements. The uncertain regulatory enforcementenvironment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses,which can lead to substantial disparities between legalreserves and subsequent actual settlements or penalties.\nRecently, claims of collusion or anti-competitive conduct\nhave become more common. Civil cases have been broughtagainst financial institutions (including us) alleging bidrigging, group boycotts or other anti-competitive practices.Antitrust laws generally provide for joint and severalliability and treble damages. These claims have in the past,and may in the future, result in significant settlements.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide,\nincluding the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating tocorrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices withregard to, government officials and others.

In addition,we rely on third-party suppliers or service providers toperform their contractual obligations and any failure ontheir part, including the failure to obtain raw materials atreasonable prices or to safely transport or storecommodities, could expose us to costs or losses. Also, whilewe seek to insure against potential risks, we may not be ableto obtain insurance to cover some of these risks and theinsurance that we have may be inadequate to cover ourlosses.\nThe occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from\nperforming under our agreements with clients, may impairour operations or financial results and may result inlitigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or otherreputational harm.\nWe may also be required to divest or discontinue certain of\nthese activities for regulatory or legal reasons. For example,the FRB has proposed regulations that could imposesignificant additional capital requirements on certaincommodity-related activities. If that occurs, we may receivea value that is less than the then carrying value, as we maybe unable to exit these activities in an orderly transaction.In conducting our businesses around the world, we\nare subject to political, economic, legal, operationaland other risks that are inherent in operating in manycountries.\nIn conducting our businesses and maintaining and\nsupporting our global operations, we are subject to risks ofpossible nationalization, expropriation, price controls,capital controls, exchange controls and other restrictivegovernmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilitiesor acts of terrorism. For example, sanctions have beenimposed by the U.S. and the E.U. on certain individuals andcompanies in Russia. In many countries, the laws andregulations applicable to the securities and financialservices industries and many of the transactions in whichwe are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may bedifficult for us to determine the exact requirements of locallaws in every market. Any determination by local regulatorsthat we have not acted in compliance with the applicationof local laws in a particular market or our failure to developeffective working relationships with local regulators couldhave a significant and negative effect not only on ourbusinesses in that market, but also on our reputationgenerally. Further, in some jurisdictions a failure to complywith laws and regulations may subject us and our personnelnot only to civil actions, but also criminal actions. We arealso subject to the enhanced risk that transactions westructure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.\nOur businesses and operations are increasingly expanding\nthroughout the world, including in emerging and growthmarkets, and we expect this trend to continue. Variousemerging and growth market countries have experiencedsevere economic and financial disruptions, includingsignificant devaluations of their currencies, defaults orthreatened defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currencyexchange controls, and low or negative growth rates intheir economies, as well as military activity, civil unrest oracts of terrorism. The possible effects of any of theseconditions include an adverse impact on our businesses andincreased volatility in financial markets generally.\n42 Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3909, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96944054-8099-4330-b15d-bba10ecf2ff4": {"__data__": {"id_": "96944054-8099-4330-b15d-bba10ecf2ff4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bcb368bf-1f4c-47e4-8d73-bcb1cca60744", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "08bce162e9cfc3092b96ebd1af9aa0d0b770ca64c790dd2cda8d1ec891668687", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f7b2ee4-a9de-4a34-b0fc-30261cb158dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "909358b3a66b3e74d38b31e915dc940aa1b0288772b154e00c13baeeb37a0ffb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cdf16e7e-dda5-4e2e-8982-aa9b3072c96d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d653a16331ffcbe11d2e3dfb4250493f8c8448f03f3bcdba7e0b9c8370ab84d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "be94cf3d0b0e31bc9ce9fc1cfcb4a0c18f146081d226aaa1c47563d55bb13612", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Global asset markets experienced significantperiods of volatility in the first and fourth quarters of 2018driven by concerns about the prospect of slowing globalgrowth and tighter monetary policy. The U.S. presidentialadministration implemented and proposed new tariffs onimports from China, which prompted retaliatory measures,and rising global trade tensions remained a meaningfulsource of uncertainty affecting asset prices throughout 2018.Political uncertainty in Europe increased as a new coalitiongovernment formed in Italy in May 2018 and the future ofthe relationship between the U.K. and E.U. remaineduncertain.

Financial instruments owned and\nfinancial instruments sold, but not yet purchased (i.e.,inventory), and certain other financial assets and financialliabilities, are included in our consolidated statements offinancial condition at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market),with related gains or losses generally recognized in ourconsolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value tomeasure financial instruments is fundamental to our riskmanagement practices and is our most critical accountingpolicy.\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer aliability in an orderly transaction between marketparticipants at the measurement date. We measure certainfinancial assets and financial liabilities as a portfolio (i.e.,based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). Indetermining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generallyaccepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) thehighest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in activemarkets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities(level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other thanlevel 1 inputs that are observable, either directly orindirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority toinputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input,we consider, among other factors, a portfolio\u2019s net riskexposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified intheir entirety based on the lowest level of input that issignificant to their fair value measurement.The fair values for substantially all of our financial assets\nand financial liabilities are based on observable prices andinputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair valuehierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets andfinancial liabilities may require appropriate valuationadjustments that a market participant would require toarrive at fair value for factors such as counterparty and ourcredit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidityand bid/offer spreads.\nInstruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\nare those which require one or more significant inputs thatare not observable. Level 3 financial assets represented2.4% as of December 2018 and 2.1% as ofDecember 2017, of our total assets. See Notes 5 through 8to the consolidated financial statements for furtherinformation about level 3 financial assets, includingchanges in level 3 financial assets and related fair valuemeasurements. Absent evidence to the contrary,instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchyare initially valued at transaction price, which is consideredto be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to thetransaction date, we use other methodologies to determinefair value, which vary based on the type of instrument.Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instrumentsrequires judgments to be made. These judgments include:\n\u2030Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/\nor model for each type of level 3 financial instrument;\n\u2030Determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all\nrelevant empirical market data, including pricesevidenced by market transactions, interest rates, creditspreads, volatilities and correlations; and\n\u2030Determining appropriate valuation adjustments,\nincluding those related to illiquidity or counterpartycredit quality.\nRegardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and\nassumptions are only changed when corroborated bysubstantive evidence.\nControls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments.\nMarket makers and investment professionals in ourrevenue-producing units are responsible for pricing ourfinancial instruments.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4520, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3e060c0-f4fc-44ed-b485-6431b7ab6914": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3e060c0-f4fc-44ed-b485-6431b7ab6914", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb341094-b3f5-497e-a955-b85d00d09ff2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "37a8f5c687109ca82593b58f5aa7cbd1b1159bce9a4b31b73ba870a8807e5df0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d91384f-cfdb-4338-8622-b81aa4a907de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c66596f9a6fa0a2b7a601e675050b5fa7fe0852650918a4e2334815898b33217", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c121cd7-050a-459d-bf98-9cb48cb19dcc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "119cf92cafaf36d614f6da867b040e3c7f898da95360bc627489e7339a167d6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "67085a316d8360241043d0c5edd2b86d22a76762ba791d8a498e8eaf1422cb73", "text": "Subsequent to thetransaction date, we use other methodologies to determinefair value, which vary based on the type of instrument.Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instrumentsrequires judgments to be made.

All financial instruments at fair value\nclassified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy aresubject to our independent price verification process. Theobjective of price verification is to have an informed andindependent opinion with regard to the valuation offinancial instruments under review. Instruments that haveone or more significant inputs which cannot becorroborated by external market data are classified inlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verificationstrategies utilized by our independent risk oversight andcontrol functions include:\n\u2030Trade Comparison. Analysis of trade data (both internal\nand external, where available) is used to determine themost relevant pricing inputs and valuations.\n\u2030External Price Comparison. Valuations and prices are\ncompared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g.,brokers or dealers, Markit, Bloomberg, IDC, TRACE).Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensureconsistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotationsor third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation orprice verification, greater priority is generally given toexecutable quotations.\n\u2030Calibration to Market Comparables. Market-based\ntransactions are used to corroborate the valuation ofpositions with similar characteristics, risks andcomponents.\n\u2030Relative Value Analyses. Market-based transactions\nare analyzed to determine the similarity, measured interms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrumentrelative to another or, for a given instrument, of onematurity relative to another.\n\u2030Collateral Analyses. Margin calls on derivatives are\nanalyzed to determine implied values, which are used tocorroborate our valuations.\n\u2030Execution of Trades. Where appropriate, trading desks\nare instructed to execute trades in order to provideevidence of market-clearing levels.\n\u2030Backtesting. Valuations are corroborated by\ncomparison to values realized upon sales.\nSee Notes 5 through 8 to the consolidated financial\nstatements for further information about fair valuemeasurements.\nReview of Net Revenues. Independent risk oversight and\ncontrol functions ensure adherence to our pricing policythrough a combination of daily procedures, including theexplanation and attribution of net revenues based on theunderlying factors. Through this process, we independentlyvalidate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair valueor trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensurethat risks are being properly categorized and quantified.Review of Valuation Models. Our independent model\nrisk management group (Model Risk Management),consisting of quantitative professionals who are separatefrom model developers, performs an independent modelreview and validation process of our valuation models.New or changed models are reviewed and approved priorto being put into use. Models are evaluated andre-approved annually to assess the impact of any changes inthe product or market and any market developments inpricing theories. See \u201cRisk Management \u2014 Model RiskManagement\u201d for further information about the reviewand validation of our valuation models.\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets\nGoodwill. Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in\nexcess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiableintangible assets, at the acquisition date.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth\nquarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstanceschange that indicate an impairment may exist. Whenassessing goodwill for impairment, first, qualitative factorsare assessed to determine whether it is more likely than notthat the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less thanits estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitativeassessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill testis performed by comparing the estimated fair value of eachreporting unit with its estimated carrying value.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we assessed goodwill for\nimpairment for each of our reporting units by performing aqualitative assessment. The qualitative assessment requiredmanagement to make judgments and to evaluate severalfactors, which included, but were not limited to,performance indicators, firm and industry events,macroeconomic indicators and fair value indicators. Basedon our evaluation of these factors, we determined that itwas more likely than not that the estimated fair value ofeach of the reporting units exceeded its respective estimatedcarrying value.

We amortize our\nidentifiable intangible assets over their estimated usefullives generally using the straight-line method. Identifiableintangible assets are tested for impairment whenever eventsor changes in circumstances suggest that an asset\u2019s or assetgroup\u2019s carrying value may not be fully recoverable.\nA prolonged or severe period of market weakness, or\nsignificant changes in regulation, could adversely impactour businesses and impair the value of our identifiableintangible assets. In addition, certain events could indicate apotential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets,including weaker business performance resulting in adecrease in our customer base and decreases in revenuesfrom customer contracts and relationships. Managementjudgment is required to evaluate whether indications ofpotential impairment have occurred, and to test intangibleassets for impairment, if required.\nAn impairment, generally calculated as the difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and the carrying value ofan asset or asset group, is recognized if the total of theestimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset orasset group is less than the corresponding carrying value.\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for\nfurther information about our identifiable intangible assets.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements forinformation about Recent Accounting Developments.\nUse of Estimates\nU.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimatesand assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make inconnection with fair value measurements and theaccounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets,the use of estimates and assumptions is also important indetermining the allowance for credit losses on loansreceivable and lending commitments held for investment,provisions for losses that may arise from litigation andregulatory proceedings (including governmentalinvestigations), and provisions for losses that may arisefrom tax audits.We estimate and record an allowance for credit losses\nrelated to our loans receivable and lending commitmentsheld for investment. Management\u2019s estimate of credit lossesentails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates,and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. SeeNote 9 to the consolidated financial statements for furtherinformation about the allowance for credit losses.\nWe also estimate and provide for potential losses that may\narise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to theextent that such losses are probable and can be reasonablyestimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of therange of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of therelated reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedingswhere we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. SeeNotes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statementsfor information about certain judicial, litigation andregulatory proceedings.\nSignificant judgment is required in making these estimates\nand our final liabilities may ultimately be materiallydifferent. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigationand regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-casebasis and represents an estimate of probable losses afterconsidering, among other factors, the progress of each case,proceeding or investigation, our experience and theexperience of others in similar cases, proceedings orinvestigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\nIn accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions\nin the financial statements only when it is more likely thannot that the position will be sustained on examination bythe relevant taxing authority based on the technical meritsof the position. See Note 24 to the consolidated financialstatements for further information about income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe composition of our net revenues has varied over time asfinancial markets and the scope of our operations havechanged.

During 2018, our market-\nmaking activities reflected generally higher levels of volatilityand improved client activity, compared with a low volatilityenvironment in 2017. In investment banking, industry-widemergers and acquisitions volumes increased compared with2017, while industry-wide underwriting transactionsdecreased. Our other principal transactions revenuesbenefited from company-specific events, including sales, andstrong corporate performance, while investments in publicequities reflected losses, as global equity prices generallydecreased in 2018, particularly towards the end of the year.In investment management, our assets under supervisionincreased reflecting net inflows in liquidity products, fixedincome assets and equity assets, partially offset bydepreciation in client assets, primarily in equity assets.\nIf market-making or investment banking activity levels decline,\nor assets under supervision decline, or asset prices continue todecline, net revenues would likely be negatively impacted. See\u201cSegment Operating Results\u201d for further information aboutthe operating environment and material trends anduncertainties that may impact our results of operations.\nDuring 2017, generally higher asset prices and tighter credit\nspreads were supportive of industry-wide underwritingactivities, investment management performance and otherprincipal transactions. However, low levels of volatility inequity, fixed income, currency and commodity marketscontinued to negatively affect our market-making activities.\n2018 versus 2017\nNet revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were$36.62 billion for 2018, 12% higher than 2017, primarilydue to significantly higher market making revenues and netinterest income, as well as higher investment managementrevenues and investment banking revenues.\nNon-Interest Revenues.

Additionally, the decreasecompared with 2017 reflected the impact of the lower U.S.corporate income tax rate in 2018. The estimated impact ofTax Legislation was an increase in income tax expense of$4.40 billion for 2017. During 2018, we finalized thisestimate to reflect the impact of updated information,including subsequent guidance issued by the IRS, resulting ina $487 million income tax benefit for 2018.\nThe effective income tax rate for 2017 was 61.5%, up from\n28.2% for 2016. The increase compared with 2016 wasprimarily due to the estimated impact of Tax Legislation,which was enacted on December 22, 2017, partially offsetby tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-basedawards in accordance with ASU No. 2016-09.\nEffective January 1, 2018, Tax Legislation reduced the U.S.\ncorporate tax rate to 21%, eliminated tax deductions forcertain expenses and enacted two new taxes, Base Erosionand Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) and Global Intangible LowTaxed Income (GILTI). BEAT is an alternative minimumtax that applies to banks that pay more than 2% of totaldeductible expenses to certain foreign subsidiaries. GILTI iseffectively a 10.5% tax, before allowable credits for foreigntaxes paid, on the annual taxable income of certain foreignsubsidiaries. Income tax expense associated with GILTI isrecognized as incurred. During 2018, the IRS issuedproposed regulations relating to BEAT and GILTI. Our2018 effective income tax rate includes estimates for BEATand GILTI that are based on our current interpretation ofthese proposed regulations. We do not expect that thefinalization of these proposed regulations will have amaterial impact on these estimates.\nBased on our current interpretations of the rules and\nlegislative guidance to date, we expect our 2019 tax rate tobe between 22% and 23%, excluding the impact of equity-based compensation.Segment Operating Results\nThe table below presents the net revenues, provision forcredit losses, operating expenses and pre-tax earnings bysegment.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2933, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9af7c1d5-5ef8-4a3f-b3cb-7b3698a7e6e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9af7c1d5-5ef8-4a3f-b3cb-7b3698a7e6e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "183cdfc1-5926-4cc2-a5a5-5d9c1255449e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "91e0896ee19c1ec6cb7334b9079955f11c4766058cbd450f96d5fee50696edbf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd6af63d-4028-4bfe-b4a5-18002c675915", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c0d5224761d4da9fdc402de96ae1b67bd7aed963c9701fa16ff0d4c30ada0606", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5bdc3916-1e54-4e75-bd31-71eafd215b78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "59157233e05870ef32542dd1dce28fd79a8980c7be615e6eae7914e03a7836a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b723e1970bc7272d9c942b62201e8046ee246ab3acd9d6fc03795d2c4124ea74", "text": "GILTI iseffectively a 10.5% tax, before allowable credits for foreigntaxes paid, on the annual taxable income of certain foreignsubsidiaries.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nMarket-Making Activities\nAs a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquidand less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients,such as corporations, financial institutions, investmentfunds and governments, to assist clients in meeting theirinvestment objectives and in managing their risks. In thisrole, we seek to earn the difference between the price atwhich a market participant is willing to sell an instrumentto us and the price at which another market participant iswilling to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offerspread). In addition, we maintain inventory, typically for ashort period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of,client demand. We also hold inventory to actively manageour risk exposures that arise from these market-makingactivities. Our market-making inventory is recorded infinancial instruments owned (long positions) or financialinstruments sold, but not yet purchased (short positions) inour consolidated statements of financial condition.\nOur results are influenced by a combination of\ninterconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels andtransactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity),and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory andinterest income and interest expense related to the holding,hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature ofour market-making activities, disaggregation of netrevenues into client activity and market-making inventorychanges is judgmental and has inherent complexities andlimitations.\nThe amount and composition of our net revenues vary over\ntime as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelatedfactors affecting economic and market conditions,including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes ininterest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads,equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence,and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties.\nIn general, assuming all other market-making conditions\nremain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, anddecreases tend to have the opposite effect. However,changes in market-making conditions can materially impactclient activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fairvalue of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidityin the market could have the impact of (i) increasing ourbid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence andthereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widercredit spreads on our inventory positions.The table below presents the operating results of our\nInstitutional Client Services segment.\nYear Ended December\n$ in millions 2018 2017 2016\nFICC Client Execution $ 5,882 $ 5,299 $ 7,556\nEquities client execution 2,835 2,046 2,194\nCommissions and fees 3,055 2,920 3,078\nSecurities services 1,710 1,637 1,639\nTotal Equities 7,600 6,603 6,911\nTotal net revenues 13,482 11,902 14,467\nOperating expenses 10,351 9,692 9,713\nPre-tax earnings $ 3,131 $ 2,210 $ 4,754\nThe table below presents the net revenues of our\nInstitutional Client Services segment by line item in theconsolidated statements of earnings.\n$ in millionsFICC Client\nExecutionTotal\nEquitiesInstitutional\nClient\nServices\nYear Ended December 2018\nMarket making $ 5,211 $ 4,240 $ 9,451\nCommissions and fees \u2013 3,055 3,055\nNet interest income 671 305 976\nTotal net revenues $ 5,882 $ 7,600 $13,482\nYear Ended December 2017\nMarket making $ 4,403 $ 3,257 $ 7,660\nCommissions and fees \u2013 2,920 2,920Net interest income 896 426 1,322\nTotal net revenues $ 5,299 $ 6,603 $11,902\nYear Ended December 2016\nMarket making $ 6,803 $ 3,130 $ 9,933\nCommissions and fees \u2013 3,078 3,078Net interest income 753 703 1,456\nTotal net revenues $ 7,556 $ 6,911 $14,467\nIn the table above:\n\u2030The difference between commissions and fees and those\nin the consolidated statements of earnings representscommissions and fees included in our InvestmentManagement segment.\n\u2030See \u201cNet Revenues\u201d for further information about\nmarket making revenues, commissions and fees, and netinterest income.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4201, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b632ddeb-354b-4748-91b8-b30faee20028": {"__data__": {"id_": "b632ddeb-354b-4748-91b8-b30faee20028", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bcea7bb2-9af8-431e-9b9d-00dce56c62ca", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c3a5c2c28a4c7233569504a38ca436371d5e769c2bd79e878904501d4b4a5245", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "847a7294-c1a4-4c41-b11d-893c6b51ca7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3c4383173ca1114cee6daee055e66b242cce06333f80c98a0bd8b3b689f23fda", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "42341df6-2735-4a0a-b046-956b9fb5fb71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "46f8848182ac26d644c97a259f689e64ceaf24c3750af5a7d93cfef418d0da2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "62873632c94b4e48d45aa2b3b11e823542ed52b24c6f0839b3f958e3de3b0f7a", "text": "\u2030See \u201cNet Revenues\u201d for further information about\nmarket making revenues, commissions and fees, and netinterest income.

During 2018, Institutional\nClient Services operated in an environment characterized bygenerally higher levels of volatility and improved clientactivity, compared with a low volatility environment in2017. The average daily VIX for 2018 increased to 17,reflecting periods of high volatility in the first and fourthquarters of 2018, compared with 11 for 2017. In 2018,global equity markets generally decreased (with the MSCIWorld Index down 11%) and in credit markets, spreadsgenerally widened (with U.S. high-yield credit spreadswider by 139 basis points), both particularly towards theend of the year. Oil prices decreased to $45 per barrel(WTI), while natural gas prices were essentially unchangedat $2.94 per million British thermal units compared to theend of 2017. If activity levels decline, net revenues inInstitutional Client Services would likely be negativelyimpacted. See \u201cBusiness Environment\u201d for furtherinformation about economic and market conditions in theglobal operating environment during the year.\nDuring 2017, low volatility levels in equity, fixed income,\ncurrency and commodity markets impacted the operatingenvironment for Institutional Client Services.

During 2018, our assets under\nsupervision increased reflecting net inflows in liquidityproducts, fixed income assets and equity assets. Thisincrease was partially offset by depreciation in our clientassets, primarily in equity assets, as global equity pricesgenerally decreased in 2018, particularly towards the end ofthe year. The mix of our average assets under supervisionbetween long-term assets under supervision and liquidityproducts during 2018 was essentially unchanged comparedwith 2017. In the future, if asset prices continue to decline,or investors continue to favor assets that typically generatelower fees or investors withdraw their assets, net revenuesin Investment Management would likely be negativelyimpacted.\nDuring 2017, Investment Management operated in an\nenvironment characterized by generally higher asset prices,resulting in appreciation in both equity and fixed incomeassets. Our long-term assets under supervision increasedfrom net inflows primarily in fixed income and alternativeinvestment assets. These increases were partially offset bynet outflows in liquidity products. As a result, the mix ofour average assets under supervision during 2017 shiftedslightly from liquidity products to long-term assets undersupervision compared to the mix at the end of 2016.2018 versus 2017. Net revenues in Investment\nManagement were $7.02 billion for 2018, 13% higher than2017, primarily due to significantly higher incentive fees, asa result of harvesting. Management and other fees were alsohigher, reflecting higher average assets under supervisionand the impact of the recently adopted revenue recognitionstandard, partially offset by shifts in the mix of client assetsand strategies. In addition, transaction revenues werehigher.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nBalance Sheet and Funding Sources\nBalance Sheet Management\nOne of our risk management disciplines is our ability tomanage the size and composition of our balance sheet.While our asset base changes due to client activity, marketfluctuations and business opportunities, the size andcomposition of our balance sheet also reflects factorsincluding (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount ofequity capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, amongother factors. See \u201cEquity Capital Management andRegulatory Capital \u2014 Equity Capital Management\u201d forinformation about our equity capital management process.\nAlthough our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day\nbasis, our total assets at quarter-end and year-end dates aregenerally not materially different from those occurringwithin our reporting periods.\nIn order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to\nmaintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and haveprocesses in place to dynamically manage our assets andliabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning,(ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and(iv) scenario analyses.\nBalance Sheet Planning. We prepare a balance sheet plan\nthat combines our projected total assets and composition ofassets with our expected funding sources over a three-yeartime horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may beadjusted in response to changing business needs or marketconditions. The objectives of this planning process are:\n\u2030To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into\naccount the general state of the financial markets andexpected business activity levels, as well as regulatoryrequirements;\n\u2030To allow Treasury and our independent risk oversight\nand control functions to objectively evaluate balancesheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units inthe context of our overall balance sheet constraints,including our liability profile and equity capital levels,and key metrics; and\n\u2030To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to\nraise, based on our projected assets and contractualmaturities.\nTreasury and our independent risk oversight and control\nfunctions, along with our revenue-producing units, reviewcurrent and prior period information and expectations forthe year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specificinformation reviewed includes asset and liability size andcomposition, limit utilization, risk and performancemeasures, and capital usage.Our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance\nsheets by business, funding projections and projected keymetrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide AssetLiability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee.See \u201cRisk Management \u2014 Overview and Structure of RiskManagement\u201d for an overview of our risk managementstructure.\nBalance Sheet Limits. The Firmwide Asset Liability\nCommittee and the Risk Governance Committee have theresponsibility of reviewing and approving balance sheetlimits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actualoperating levels, rather than at levels which reflect ourmaximum risk appetite, in order to ensure promptescalation and discussion among our revenue-producingunits, Treasury and our independent risk oversight andcontrol functions on a routine basis. The Firmwide AssetLiability Committee and the Risk Governance Committeereview and approve balance sheet limits. In addition, theRisk Governance Committee sets aged inventory limits forcertain financial instruments as a disincentive to holdinventory over longer periods of time. Requests for changesin limits are evaluated after giving consideration to theirimpact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits ismonitored by our revenue-producing units and Treasury, aswell as our independent risk oversight and controlfunctions.\nMonitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance\nsheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis,including asset and liability size and composition, limitutilization and risk measures. We allocate assets tobusinesses and review and analyze movements resultingfrom new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.\nScenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario analyses\nincluding as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysisand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests(DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning.See \u201cEquity Capital Management and RegulatoryCapital \u2014 Equity Capital Management\u201d for furtherinformation about these scenario analyses. These scenarioscover short-term and long-term time horizons using variousmacroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on arange of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assistus in developing our longer-term balance sheetmanagement strategy, including the level and compositionof assets, funding and equity capital. Additionally, theseanalyses help us develop approaches for maintainingappropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a varietyof situations, including a severely stressed environment.\nGoldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K 63", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5074, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc88dc11-d0c2-4528-a56d-6374f3f56c24": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc88dc11-d0c2-4528-a56d-6374f3f56c24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9afd06a4-aa8f-404f-9f9d-e7ac54a1ccba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "cc897819cfe539884bcbba7c5565a6e73df7a4273cc3b32df80be38e5ef6c141", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b485bf6-0702-4148-9f64-512657d1b017", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5dadb70632bea807b2083e285eefb91976411486963671701b526ea2a15ce5bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "73a093a7-254a-41d7-894d-8e33e704ff71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e82a29c317eaf1393bc57d6926ae33784119fd36c10de4b962c6e61601935bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e5a9c1ccdf5c9e0aebf1524de696740f475a3845078577c7d1f99cb8a172b8e2", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Theincrease in cash and cash equivalents reflected the impact ofour and clients\u2019 activities. The increase in financialinstruments owned primarily reflected higher client activityin government and agency obligations, partially offset bylower activity in equity securities by us and our clients. Theincrease in loans receivable primarily reflected an increasein corporate and commercial real estate loans. The netdecrease in collateralized agreements reflected the impact ofour and clients\u2019 activities.\nAs of December 2018, total liabilities in our consolidated\nstatements of financial condition were $841.61 billion, anincrease of $7.08 billion from December 2017, primarilyreflecting increases in deposits of $19.65 billion andunsecured long-term borrowings of $6.46 billion, partiallyoffset by decreases in collateralized financings of$12.34 billion and unsecured short term borrowings of$6.42 billion. The increase in deposits primarily reflectedan increase in consumer deposits. The increase in unsecuredlong-term borrowings was primarily due to net newissuances. The decrease in collateralized financings reflectedthe impact of our and clients\u2019 activities. The decrease inunsecured short term borrowings was primarily due tomaturities and early retirements.\nOur total repurchase agreements, accounted for as\ncollateralized financings, were $78.72 billion as ofDecember 2018 and $84.72 billion as of December 2017,which were 1% higher as of December 2018 and 2% loweras of December 2017 than the daily average amount ofrepurchase agreements over the respective quarters, and12% lower as of December 2018 and 1% lower as ofDecember 2017 than the daily average amount ofrepurchase agreements over the respective years. As ofDecember 2018, the increase in our repurchase agreementsrelative to the daily average during the quarter, anddecrease in our repurchase agreements relative to the dailyaverage during the year, resulted from client and ouractivity at the end of the period.\nThe level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between\nand within periods, primarily due to providing clients withaccess to highly liquid collateral, such as liquid governmentand agency obligations, through collateralized financingactivities.The table below presents information about the balance\nsheet and the leverage ratios.\nAs of December\n$ in millions 2018 2017\nTotal assets $931,796 $916,776\nUnsecured long-term borrowings $224,149 $217,687\nTotal shareholders\u2019 equity $ 90,185 $ 82,243\nLeverage ratio 10.3x 11.1x\nDebt to equity ratio 2.5x 2.6x\nIn the table above:\n\u2030The leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total\nshareholders\u2019 equity and measures the proportion ofequity and debt we use to finance assets.

We generally distribute ourfunding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in avariety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Webelieve that our relationships with our creditors are criticalto our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments,securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurancecompanies, mutual funds and individuals. We haveimposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditorconcentration across our funding programs.\nDeposits. Our deposits provide us with a diversified source\nof funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. Agrowing portion of our deposit base consists of consumerdeposits. Deposits are primarily used to finance lendingactivity, other inventory and a portion of our GCLA. Weraise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits,through internal and third-party broker-dealers, and fromconsumers and institutional clients, and primarily throughGoldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA) and GoldmanSachs International Bank (GSIB). In September 2018, welaunched Marcus: by Goldman Sachs in the U.K. to accept\ndeposits. See Note 14 to the consolidated financialstatements for further information about our deposits.Secured Funding. We fund a significant amount of\ninventory on a secured basis. Secured funding includescollateralized financings in the consolidated statements offinancial condition. We may also pledge our inventory ascollateral for securities borrowed under a securities lendingagreement. We also use our own inventory to covertransactions in which we or our clients have sold securitiesthat have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is lesssensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecuredfunding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders.Nonetheless, we continually analyze the refinancing risk ofour secured funding activities, taking into account tradetenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations,collateral eligibility and counterparty roll overprobabilities.

As part of\ncapital planning, we project sources and uses of capitalgiven a range of business environments, including stressedconditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identifyand measure material risks associated with our businessactivities, including market risk, credit risk and operationalrisk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.\nThe following is a description of our capital planning and\nstress testing process:\n\u2030Capital Planning. Our capital planning process\nincorporates an internal capital adequacy assessmentwith the objective of ensuring that we are appropriatelycapitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. Weincorporate stress scenarios into our capital planningprocess with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensurewe remain adequately capitalized after experiencing asevere stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy isviewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidityadequacy and is integrated into our overall riskmanagement structure, governance and policyframework.\nOur capital planning process also includes an internal\nrisk-based capital assessment. This assessmentincorporates market risk, credit risk and operational risk.Market risk is calculated by using Value-at-Risk (VaR)calculations supplemented by risk-based add-ons whichinclude risks related to rare events (tail risks). Credit riskutilizes assumptions about our counterparties\u2019probability of default and the size of our losses in theevent of a default. Operational risk is calculated based onscenarios incorporating multiple types of operationalfailures, as well as considering internal and externalactual loss experience. Backtesting for market risk andcredit risk is used to gauge the effectiveness of models atcapturing and measuring relevant risks.\n\u2030Stress Testing. Our stress tests incorporate our\ninternally designed stress scenarios, including ourinternally developed severely adverse scenario, and thoserequired under CCAR and DFAST, and are designed tocapture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We providefurther information about our stress test processes and asummary of the results on our website as described in\u201cBusiness \u2014 Available Information\u201d in Part I, Item 1 ofthis Form 10-K.\nAs required by the FRB\u2019s annual CCAR rules, we submit a\ncapital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of theFRB\u2019s review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for ourunique risks and that permits continued operation duringtimes of economic and financial stress.The FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have\nthe capital necessary to continue operating under thebaseline and stress scenarios provided by the FRB and thosedeveloped internally. This evaluation also takes intoaccount our process for identifying risk, our controls andgovernance for capital planning, and our guidelines formaking capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRBevaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e.,dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions ofstock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) andissue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenariosand firm-specific assumptions.\nIn addition, the DFAST rules currently require us to\nconduct stress tests on a semi-annual basis and publish asummary of results. The FRB also conducts its own annualstress tests and publishes a summary of certain results.\nWith respect to our 2018 CCAR submission, the FRB\ninformed us that it did not object to our capital plan,conditioned upon us returning not more than $6.30 billionof capital from the third quarter of 2018 through thesecond quarter of 2019. The capital plan provides for up to$5.00 billion in repurchases of outstanding common stockand $1.30 billion in total common stock dividends,including an increase in our common stock dividend of$0.05 from $0.80 to $0.85 per share in the second quarterof 2019, subject to the approval by the Board of Directorsof Group Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nContingency Capital Plan. As part of our comprehensive\ncapital management policy, we maintain a contingencycapital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides aframework for analyzing and responding to a perceived oractual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to,identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well asmitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriatecommunication procedures to follow during a crisis period,including internal dissemination of information, as well astimely communication with external stakeholders.\nCapital Attribution. We assess each of our businesses\u2019\ncapital usage based upon our internal assessment of risks,which incorporates an attribution of all of our relevantregulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capitalrequirements are allocated using our attributed equityframework, which takes into consideration our mostbinding capital constraints. Our most binding capitalconstraint is based on the results of the FRB\u2019s annual stresstest scenarios which include the Standardized risk-basedcapital and leverage ratios.\nWe also attribute risk-weighted assets (RWAs) to our\nbusiness segments. As of December 2018, approximately60% of RWAs calculated in accordance with theStandardized Capital Rules and approximately 50% ofRWAs calculated in accordance with the Basel III AdvancedRules, were attributed to our Institutional Client Servicessegment and substantially all of the remaining RWAs wereattributed to our Investing & Lending segment. We managethe levels of our capital usage based upon balance sheet andrisk limits, as well as capital return analyses of ourbusinesses based on our capital attribution.\nShare Repurchase Program. We use our share\nrepurchase program to help maintain the appropriate levelof common equity. The repurchase program is effectedprimarily through regular open-market purchases (whichmay include repurchase plans designed to comply withRule 10b5-1), the amounts and timing of which aredetermined primarily by our current and projected capitalposition and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as partof CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases mayalso be influenced by general market conditions and theprevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock.As of December 2018, the remaining share authorization\nunder our existing repurchase program was 33.7 millionshares; however, we are only permitted to makerepurchases to the extent that such repurchases have notbeen objected to by the FRB.

In connection with our\nresolution planning efforts, we have established aResolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework,which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GSBank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI,GSIB, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), GoldmanSachs Asset Management, L.P. and Goldman Sachs AssetManagement International (GSAMI)) have access tosufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity,subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that theyare able to wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcyfiling in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.\nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts\nframework, which is designed to provide the Board withinformation needed to make an informed decision onwhether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedingsfor Group Inc.\nRating Agency Guidelines\nThe credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to theobligations of Group Inc., which directly issues orguarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debtobligations. GS&Co. and GSI have been assigned long- andshort-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies.GS Bank USA and GSIB have also been assigned long- andshort-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long-and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit ratingagencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certainother subsidiaries of Group Inc.\nThe level and composition of our equity capital are among\nthe many factors considered in determining our creditratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligiblecapital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy,and assessments are generally based on a combination offactors rather than a single calculation.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nIn November 2016, the European Commission proposed\namendments to the CRR to implement a 3% minimumleverage ratio requirement for certain E.U. financialinstitutions. This leverage ratio compares the CRR\u2019sdefinition of Tier 1 capital to a measure of leverageexposure, defined as the sum of certain assets plus certainoff-balance-sheet exposures (which include a measure ofderivatives, securities financing transactions, commitmentsand guarantees), less Tier 1 capital deductions. Anyrequired minimum leverage ratio is expected to becomeeffective for GSI no earlier than January 1, 2021. GSI had aleverage ratio of 4.4% as of December 2018 and 4.1% as ofDecember 2017. Tier 1 capital as of December 2018included amounts which will be finalized upon the issuanceof GSI\u2019s 2018 annual audited financial statements and theseamounts contributed approximately 31 basis points to theleverage ratio. This leverage ratio is based on our currentinterpretation and understanding of this rule and mayevolve as we discuss the interpretation and application ofthis rule with GSI\u2019s regulators.\nGSJCL, our Japanese broker-dealer, is regulated by Japan\u2019s\nFinancial Services Agency.

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010,significantly altered the financial regulatory regime withinwhich we operate. In addition, other reforms have beenadopted or are being considered by regulators and policymakers worldwide. Given that many of the new andproposed rules are highly complex, the full impact ofregulatory reform will not be known until the rules areimplemented and market practices develop under the finalregulations.\nSee \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K for further information about the laws, rulesand regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulationsthat apply to us and our operations.Resolution and Recovery Plans.

In March 2017, the U.K. government commenced\nthe formal proceedings to end the U.K.\u2019s membership in theE.U. There is a two year window during which the terms ofthe U.K.\u2019s exit from the E.U. may be negotiated. This periodexpires on March 29, 2019.\nThe E.U. and the U.K. had negotiated a withdrawal\nagreement which both the U.K. and the E.U. Parliamentsmust ratify (the Withdrawal Agreement). The U.K.Parliament has not yet approved the WithdrawalAgreement. As a result, there is a possibility that the U.K.will leave the E.U. on March 29, 2019 without anytransitional arrangements in place and firms based in theU.K. will lose their existing access arrangements to the E.U.markets; such a scenario is referred to as a \u201chard\u201d Brexit.\nWe have been preparing for anticipated outcomes,\nincluding a hard Brexit, with the goal of ensuring that wemaintain access to E.U. markets and are able to continue toprovide products and services to our E.U. clients. In orderfor us to continue to serve our E.U. clients, clients may needto face an entity within one of the remaining E.U. memberstates, unless national laws in the applicable member statepermit cross-border services from non-E.U. entities (forexample, based on specific licenses or exemptions).\nOur plan to manage a hard Brexit scenario involves\ntransition of certain activities to new and/or different legalentities; working with clients and counterparties toredocument transactions so they face one of our E.U. legalentities; changes to our infrastructure; obtaining anddeveloping new real estate; and, in some cases, moving ourpeople to offices in the E.U.In a hard Brexit scenario or as otherwise necessary, our plan\nis to service our E.U. client base in the following manner:\n\u2030Our German bank subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank\nEurope SE (GSBE), will act as our main operatingsubsidiary in the E.U. and will assume certain functionsthat can no longer be efficiently and effectively performedby our U.K. operating subsidiaries, including GSI, GSIBand GSAMI.\n\u2030Consistent with our global approach of being closer to\nour clients, we are also setting up branches of GSBE in anumber of jurisdictions in the E.U. to enable InvestmentBanking, Institutional Client Services and PWMinvestment personnel to be situated in our offices in thosecountries.\n\u2030We have received approval from the German financial\nregulator, BaFin, for a licensed investment firm, GoldmanSachs Europe SE, which will be able to conduct certainactivities (such as activities related to physicalcommodities and related products) that GSBE may beprevented from undertaking.\n\u2030In order to service our Investment Management business,\nwe have received approval from the Irish FinancialRegulator, the Central Bank of Ireland, for a CollectiveInvestment Fund and Alternative Investment FundManager in Ireland, to replace the similar existingLondon-based Alternative Investment Fund Manager,which will lose its E.U. passport post-Brexit.\n\u2030A large portion of our Institutional Client Services and\nInvestment Banking clients are classified as professionalsor eligible counterparties in specific jurisdictions and maychoose to continue being serviced by, and to continue totransact with, the U.K. service providers and entitiesunder domestic arrangements provided by individualmember states (licenses or exemptions).

Central banks and regulators in a\nnumber of major jurisdictions (for example, U.S., U.K.,E.U., Switzerland and Japan) have convened workinggroups to find, and implement the transition to, suitablereplacements for IBORs. The U.K. FCA, which regulatesLIBOR, has announced that it will not compel panel banksto contribute to LIBOR after 2021. The E.U. BenchmarksRegulation imposed conditions under which onlycompliant benchmarks may be used in new contracts after2021.\nMarket-led working groups in major jurisdictions, noted\nabove, have already selected their preferred alternative risk-free reference rates and have published and will continue topublish consultations on issues, including methodologiesfor fallback provisions in contracts and financialinstruments linked to IBORs and the development of termstructures for alternative risk-free reference rates, whichwill be critical for financial markets to transition to the useof alternative risk-free reference rates in place of IBORs.\nWe have exposure to IBORs, including in financial\ninstruments and contracts that mature after 2021. Ourexposures arise from securities and loans we hold forinvestment or in connection with market-making activities,as well as derivatives we enter into to make markets for ourclients and hedge our risks. We also have exposure toIBORs in the floating-rate securities and other fundingproducts we issue.\nThe markets for alternative risk-free reference rates are\ndeveloping and as they develop we expect to transition tothese alternative risk-free reference rates.\nWe are seeking to facilitate an orderly transition from\nIBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates for us and ourclients. Accordingly, we have created a program thatfocuses on:\n\u2030Evaluating and monitoring the impacts across our\nbusinesses, including transactions and products;\u2030Identifying and evaluating the scope of existing financial\ninstruments and contracts that may be affected, and theextent to which those financial instruments and contractsalready contain appropriate fallback language or wouldrequire amendment, either through bilateral negotiationor using industry-wide tools, such as protocols;\n\u2030Enhancements to infrastructure (for example, models and\nsystems) to prepare for a smooth transition to alternativerisk-free reference rates;\n\u2030Active participation in central bank and sector working\ngroups, including responding to industry consultations;and\n\u2030Client education and communication.\nAs part of this program, we have sought to systematically\nidentify the risks inherent in this transition, includingfinancial risks (for example, earnings volatility under stressdue to widening swap spreads and the loss of fundingsources as a result of counterparties\u2019 reluctance toparticipate in transitioning their positions) andnonfinancial risks (for example, the inability to negotiatefallbacks with clients and/or counterparties and operationalimpediments to the transition). We are engaged with arange of industry and regulatory working groups (forexample, ISDA, the Bank of England\u2019s Working Group onSterling Risk Free Reference Rates and the FederalReserve\u2019s Alternative Reference Rates Committee) and willcontinue to engage with our clients and counterparties tofacilitate an orderly transition to alternative risk-freereference rates.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and\nContractual Obligations\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into varioustypes of off-balance-sheet arrangements.

Accordingly, we have established an enterprise riskmanagement framework that employs a comprehensive,integrated approach to risk management, and is designed toenable comprehensive risk management processes throughwhich we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks weassume in conducting our activities. These risks includeliquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal,compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational riskexposures. Our risk management structure is built aroundthree core components: governance, processes and people.Governance. Risk management governance starts with the\nBoard, which both directly and through its committees,including its Risk Committee, oversees our riskmanagement policies and practices implemented throughthe enterprise risk management framework. The Board isalso responsible for the annual review and approval of ourrisk appetite statement. The risk appetite statementdescribes the levels and types of risk we are willing to acceptor to avoid, in order to achieve our strategic businessobjectives, while remaining in compliance with regulatoryrequirements.\nThe Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks,\nincluding liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operationalrisk and model risk from our independent risk oversightand control functions, including the chief risk officer, andon compliance risk and conduct risk from the head ofCompliance, on legal and regulatory matters from thegeneral counsel, and on other matters impacting ourreputation from the chair of our Firmwide Client andBusiness Standards Committee and our FirmwideReputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reportsto our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee ofthe Board. As part of the review of the firmwide riskportfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the RiskCommittee of the Board of relevant risk metrics andmaterial exposures, including risk limits and thresholdsestablished in our risk appetite statement.\nThe Enterprise Risk Management department, which\nreports to our chief risk officer, oversees theimplementation of our risk governance structure and corerisk management processes and is responsible for ensuringthat our enterprise risk management framework providesthe Board, our risk committees and senior managementwith a consistent and integrated approach to managing ourvarious risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite.\nOur revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury,\nOperations and Technology, are our first line of defenseand are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generatingactivities, as well as for assessing and managing those riskswithin our risk appetite.\nOur independent risk oversight and control functions are\nconsidered our second line of defense and provideindependent assessment, oversight and challenge of therisks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead andparticipate in risk-oriented committees. Independent riskoversight and control functions include Compliance,Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Credit RiskManagement, Enterprise Risk Management, HumanCapital Management, Legal, Liquidity Risk Management,Market Risk Management, Model Risk Management,Operational Risk Management and Tax.\n76 Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d961fe97-e040-4b80-862d-d43d34b6fb18": {"__data__": {"id_": "d961fe97-e040-4b80-862d-d43d34b6fb18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f465154d-5633-4f80-abc1-e6a71cd2a313", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1fdeaf8dbe07897b2c11d3182aacce1992729d06d4dd5c61691515ce104ef605", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "86a090da-5149-440b-81b3-af1f7542b107", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "68c09ededf0e9414fd084bef0c07b9a90858c053a772eefe7d308352d031d028", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "05127c4d-c58a-47ef-9c75-5937bb18a3af", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "35a3957ae031dd82820572e8ba12df22b4beac84d37005ed252d40419776840d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9cca54f2ed0de47d02a18c377bc2a83eee691262263d6c2d91ac5813b418f517", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Internal Audit includesprofessionals with a broad range of audit and industryexperience, including risk management expertise. InternalAudit is responsible for independently assessing andvalidating the effectiveness of key controls, including thosewithin the risk management framework, and providingtimely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board,senior management and regulators.\nThe three lines of defense structure promotes the\naccountability of first line risk takers, provides aframework for effective challenge by the second line andempowers independent review from the third line.\nOur governance structure provides the protocol and\nresponsibility for decision-making on risk managementissues and ensures implementation of those decisions. Wemake extensive use of risk-related committees that meetregularly and serve as an important means to facilitate andfoster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks.\nWe maintain strong communication about risk and we have\na culture of collaboration in decision-making among ourfirst and second lines of defense, committees and seniormanagement. While our first line of defense is responsiblefor management of their risk, we dedicate extensiveresources to our second line of defense in order to ensure astrong oversight structure and an appropriate segregationof duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture ofescalation and accountability across all functions.\nProcesses. We maintain various processes that are critical\ncomponents of our risk management framework, includingidentifying, assessing, monitoring and limiting our risks.\nTo effectively assess and monitor our risks, we maintain a\ndaily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventoryto current market levels. We carry our inventory at fairvalue, with changes in valuation reflected immediately inour risk management systems and in net revenues. We do sobecause we believe this discipline is one of the most effectivetools for assessing and managing risk and that it providestransparent and realistic insight into our inventoryexposures.\nWe also apply a rigorous framework of limits and\nthresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions,products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly orindirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits andthresholds included in our risk appetite statement atfirmwide, business and product levels. In addition, theFirmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible forapproving our risk limits framework, subject to the overalllimits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, at avariety of levels and monitoring these limits on a daily basis.The Risk Governance Committee is responsible for\napproving limits at firmwide, business and product levels.Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodicadjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximumrisk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about riskamong our first and second lines of defense, committeesand senior management, as well as rapid escalation ofrisk-related matters. See \u201cLiquidity Risk Management,\u201d\u201cMarket Risk Management,\u201d \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201dand \u201cOperational Risk Management\u201d for furtherinformation.\nActive management of our positions is another important\nprocess. Proactive mitigation of our market and creditexposures minimizes the risk that we will be required totake outsized actions during periods of stress.\nEffective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends\non our ability to get the right information to the rightpeople at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor andeffectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective ofensuring that our risk management technology systems arecomprehensive, reliable and timely.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nLiquidity Risk Management\nOverview\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fundourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events.We have in place a comprehensive and conservative set ofliquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is tobe able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businessesto continue to serve clients and generate revenues, evenunder adverse circumstances.\nTreasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has\nprimary responsibility for developing, managing andexecuting our liquidity and funding strategy within our riskappetite.\nLiquidity Risk Management, which is independent of our\nrevenue-producing units and Treasury, and reports to ourchief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing,monitoring and managing our liquidity risk throughfirmwide oversight across our global businesses and theestablishment of stress testing and limits frameworks.\nLiquidity Risk Management Principles\nWe manage liquidity risk according to three principles:(i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA tocover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintainappropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintaina viable Contingency Funding Plan.\nGCLA. GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad\nrange of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in astressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is topre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needsduring a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form ofunencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believethat the securities held in our GCLA would be readilyconvertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation,by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturitiesof resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us tomeet immediate obligations without needing to sell otherassets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitivemarkets.\nOur GCLA reflects the following principles:\u2030The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most\ncritical to a company\u2019s survival;\n\u2030Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and\ncollateral outflows, not just disruptions to financingflows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needsare determined by many factors, including marketmovements, collateral requirements and clientcommitments, all of which can change dramatically in adifficult funding environment;\u2030During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured debt, certain deposits and some typesof secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, andthe terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions andtenor) or availability of other types of secured financingmay change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and\n\u2030As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we\nestimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold moreunencumbered securities and have larger debt balancesthan our businesses would otherwise require. We believethat our liquidity is stronger with greater balances ofhighly liquid unencumbered securities, even though itincreases our total assets and our funding costs.\nWe maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs\nFunding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.\u2019s majorbroker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types, andclearing agents to provide us with sufficient operatingliquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets,even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to theGCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in severalof our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies,entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediateaccess to parent company liquidity.\nWe believe that our GCLA provides us with a resilient\nsource of funds that would be available in advance ofpotential cash and collateral outflows and gives ussignificant flexibility in managing through a difficultfunding environment.\nAsset-Liability Management. Our liquidity risk\nmanagement policies are designed to ensure we have asufficient amount of financing, even when funding marketsexperience persistent stress. We manage the maturities anddiversity of our funding across markets, products andcounterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified fundingprofile with an appropriate tenor, taking into considerationthe characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.\nOur approach to asset-liability management includes:\u2030Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of\nour funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term,diversified sources of funding in excess of our currentrequirements.

We assess ourfunding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets ina stressed environment while appropriately managingrisk.

Thisreduces the risk that our liabilities will come due inadvance of our ability to generate liquidity from the saleof our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balancesheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may bematerially shorter than their contractual maturity dates.\nOur goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to\nfund our assets and meet our contractual and contingentobligations in normal times, as well as during periods ofmarket stress. Through our dynamic balance sheetmanagement process, we use actual and projected assetbalances to determine secured and unsecured fundingrequirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved bythe Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, ourindependent risk oversight and control functions analyze,and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, ourconsolidated total capital position (unsecured long-termborrowings plus total shareholders\u2019 equity) so that wemaintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient tomeet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquiditycrisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoidreliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, werecognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent ornecessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.\nSubsidiary Funding Policies\nThe majority of our unsecured funding is raised by GroupInc., which lends the necessary funds to Funding IHC andother subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meettheir asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. Inaddition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiarieswith the necessary capital to meet their regulatoryrequirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiaryfunding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meetthe funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding isalso raised at the subsidiary level through a variety ofproducts, including deposits, secured funding andunsecured borrowings.Our intercompany funding policies assume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or securities are not freely available to itsparent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legallyprovided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, taxor other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiariesare subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to blockor reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries toGroup Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kindcould impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to makepayments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume thatthe capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is notavailable to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any otherfinancing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is notavailable to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturityof such financing.\nGroup Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and\nsubordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to itsregulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2018,Group Inc. had $29.05 billion of equity and subordinatedindebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S.registered broker-dealer; $39.69 billion invested in GSI, aregulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.76 billion invested inGSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $31.98 billioninvested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; and $3.93 billion invested in GSIB, aregulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provided, directly orindirectly, $114.38 billion of unsubordinated loans(including secured loans of $28.72 billion), and$18.09 billion of collateral and cash deposits to theseentities, substantially all of which was to GS&Co., GSI,GSJCL and GS Bank USA, as of December 2018.

We also consider other factors, including,but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intradayliquidity needs through an additional internal liquiditymodel, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, theresults of our long-term stress testing models, ourresolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatoryrequirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition,as well as the financial markets. The results of the ModeledLiquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquiditymodels are reported to senior management on a regularbasis.

Our Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios thatinclude combinations of market-wide and firm-specificstress. These scenarios are characterized by the followingqualitative elements:\n\u2030Severely challenged market environments, including low\nconsumer and corporate confidence, financial andpolitical instability, adverse changes in market values,including potential declines in equity markets andwidening of credit spreads; and\n\u2030A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material\nlosses, reputational damage, litigation, executivedeparture, and/or a ratings downgrade.\nThe following are key modeling elements of the Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow:\n\u2030Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario;\n\u2030A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior\nunsecured credit ratings;\u2030A combination of contractual outflows, such as\nupcoming maturities of unsecured debt, and contingentoutflows (e.g., actions, though not contractually required,we may deem necessary in a crisis). We assume that mostcontingent outflows will occur within the initial days andweeks of a crisis;\n\u2030No issuance of equity or unsecured debt;\n\u2030No support from additional government funding\nfacilities. Although we have access to various central bankfunding programs, we do not assume reliance onadditional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and\n\u2030No asset liquidation, other than the GCLA.\nThe potential contractual and contingent cash and\ncollateral outflows covered in our Modeled LiquidityOutflow include:\nUnsecured Funding\n\u2030Contractual: All upcoming maturities of unsecured long-\nterm debt, commercial paper and other unsecuredfunding products.

We employa variety of risk measures, each described in the respectivesections below, to monitor market risk. We hold inventoryprimarily for market making for our clients and for ourinvesting and lending activities. Our inventory, therefore,changes based on client demands and our investmentopportunities. Our inventory is accounted for at fair valueand therefore fluctuates on a daily basis, with the relatedgains and losses included in market making and otherprincipal transactions. Categories of market risk include thefollowing:\n\u2030Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the\nlevel, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilitiesof interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;\n\u2030Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in\nprices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets ofequities and equity indices;\n\u2030Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in\nspot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currencyrates; and\n\u2030Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes\nin spot prices, forward prices and volatilities ofcommodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products,natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals.\nMarket Risk Management, which is independent of our\nrevenue-producing units and reports to our chief riskofficer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoringand managing our market risk through firmwide oversightacross our global businesses.\nManagers in revenue-producing units and Market Risk\nManagement discuss market information, positions andestimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers inrevenue-producing units are accountable for managing riskwithin prescribed limits. These managers have in-depthknowledge of their positions, markets and the instrumentsavailable to hedge their exposures.Market Risk Management Process\nOur process for managing market risk includes:\n\u2030Collecting complete, accurate and timely information;\n\u2030A dynamic limit-setting framework;\n\u2030Monitoring compliance with established market risk\nlimits and reporting our exposures;\n\u2030Diversifying exposures;\n\u2030Controlling position sizes;\n\u2030Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related\nsecurities or derivatives; and\n\u2030Proactive communication between our revenue-\nproducing units and our independent risk oversight andcontrol functions.\nOur market risk management systems enable us to perform\nan independent calculation of VaR and stress measures,capture risk measures at individual position levels, attributerisk measures to individual risk factors of each position,report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., bydesk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hocanalyses in a timely manner.\nRisk Measures\nMarket Risk Management produces risk measures andmonitors them against established market risk limits. Thesemeasures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and theresults are aggregated at product, business and firmwidelevels.\nWe use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of\npotential losses for both moderate and more extrememarket moves over both short-term and long-term timehorizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, which isused for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. Our riskreports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each deskand business, and are distributed daily to seniormanagement of both our revenue-producing units and ourindependent risk oversight and control functions.\n88 Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3742, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "916b0db4-5654-402f-94b5-94528514d11e": {"__data__": {"id_": "916b0db4-5654-402f-94b5-94528514d11e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6e054af2-bf8f-4350-a672-d12f4d346ff9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b298b0802a575206159e568a3bf2868dbd97172614422c0be8318f133860f39c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b99b256a-62dc-461e-b371-eb6044063e18", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "abd4aa5d4ed334574415074afac58fdb927a834ad40c90df81a08fde4f60cb9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4c24077-2a8a-43e6-ac60-687d5766ef19", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9475315bb31279c7282e8af5b375acacf2355518d8e979aaa64d9fb0fcb5e528", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c476aa5a34376ae5a854502039dd5b36ee0e9239d2974f4550be30ee87cb0e70", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nValue-at-Risk. VaR is the potential loss in value due to\nadverse market movements over a defined time horizonwith a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilitiesincluded in VaR, see \u201cFinancial Statement Linkages toMarket Risk Measures.\u201d We typically employ a one-daytime horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a singleVaR model, which captures risks including interest rates,equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. Assuch, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios ofdifferent risk characteristics. VaR also captures thediversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.\nWe are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and\ntherefore use a variety of risk measures in our market riskmanagement process. Inherent limitations to VaR include:\n\u2030VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time\nhorizons where moves may be extreme;\n\u2030VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of\ndifferent risk positions; and\n\u2030Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce\naccurate predictions of all future market moves.\nTo comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant\nrisks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulationswith full valuation of market factors at the position level bysimultaneously shocking the relevant market factors forthat position. These market factors include spot prices,credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility andcorrelation, and are updated periodically based on changesin the composition of positions, as well as variations inmarket conditions. We sample from five years of historicaldata to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. Thehistorical data is weighted so that the relative importance ofthe data reduces over time. This gives greater importance tomore recent observations and reflects current assetvolatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates ofpotential loss. As a result, even if our positions included inVaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase withincreasing market volatility and vice versa.\nGiven its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in\nestimating risk exposures in markets in which there are nosudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.Our VaR measure does not include:\n\u2030Positions that are best measured and monitored using\nsensitivity measures; and\n\u2030The impact of changes in counterparty and our own\ncredit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in ourown credit spreads on financial liabilities for which thefair value option was elected.\nWe perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e.,\ncomparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaRto the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day)at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses andmajor regulated subsidiaries.\nStress Testing. Stress testing is a method of determining\nthe effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We usestress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as wellas the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. Weuse a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate thepotential loss from a wide range of market moves on ourportfolios, including sensitivity analysis, scenario analysisand stress tests. The results of our various stress tests areanalyzed together for risk management purposes.\nSensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a\nmarket move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g.,equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of definedmarket shocks, ranging from those that could be expectedover a one-day time horizon up to those that could takemany months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis toquantify the impact of the default of any single entity,which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures.\nScenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a\nspecified event, including how the event impacts multiplerisk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereignstress testing we calculate potential direct exposureassociated with our sovereign inventory, as well as thecorresponding debt, equity and currency exposuresassociated with our non-sovereign inventory that may beimpacted by the sovereign distress. When conductingscenario analysis, we typically consider a number ofpossible outcomes for each scenario, ranging frommoderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition,these stress tests are constructed using both historical eventsand forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.\nGoldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K 89", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4568, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4c24077-2a8a-43e6-ac60-687d5766ef19": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4c24077-2a8a-43e6-ac60-687d5766ef19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f8f3907a-aa91-448d-be43-013cfda81360", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e9e8f94e66772fbbf6b0b60dbb1a803aae9f214ba05f541fa32cc0698ac9768b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "916b0db4-5654-402f-94b5-94528514d11e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c476aa5a34376ae5a854502039dd5b36ee0e9239d2974f4550be30ee87cb0e70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5921c604-fbdb-459c-a1de-666154d24f5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6fdf3fc7ba79ea586a2da30cd4bdb84c196cb976ab5675595eefc5d1554154ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9475315bb31279c7282e8af5b375acacf2355518d8e979aaa64d9fb0fcb5e528", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Stress tests are primarily used toassess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning andstress testing process; however, stress testing is alsointegrated into our risk governance framework. Thisincludes selecting appropriate scenarios to use for ourcapital planning and stress testing process. See \u201cEquityCapital Management and Regulatory Capital \u2014 EquityCapital Management\u201d for further information.\nUnlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability\nbecause they are calculated at a specified confidence level,there is generally no implied probability that our stress testscenarios will occur. Instead, stress tests are used to modelboth moderate and more extreme moves in underlyingmarket factors. When estimating potential loss, wegenerally assume that our positions cannot be reduced orhedged (although experience demonstrates that we aregenerally able to do so).\nStress test scenarios are conducted on a regular basis as part\nof our routine risk management process and on an ad hocbasis in response to market events or concerns. Stresstesting is an important part of our risk management processbecause it allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks,highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions.\nLimits\nWe use risk limits at various levels (including firmwide,business and product) to govern our risk appetite bycontrolling the size of our exposures to market risk. Limitsare set based on VaR and on a range of stress tests relevantto our exposures. Limits are reviewed frequently andamended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflectchanging market conditions, business conditions ortolerance for risk.\nThe Risk Committee of the Board and the Risk Governance\nCommittee approve market risk limits and sub-limits atfirmwide, business and product levels, consistent with ourrisk appetite statement. In addition, Market RiskManagement (through delegated authority from the RiskGovernance Committee) sets market risk limits andsub-limits at certain product and desk levels.The purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior\nmanagement in controlling our overall risk profile.Sub-limits are set below the approved level of risk limits.Sub-limits set the desired maximum amount of exposurethat may be managed by any particular business on aday-to-day basis without additional levels of seniormanagement approval, effectively leaving day-to-daydecisions to individual desk managers and traders.Accordingly, sub-limits are a management tool designed toensure appropriate escalation rather than to establishmaximum risk tolerance. Sub-limits also distribute riskamong various businesses in a manner that is consistentwith their level of activity and client demand, taking intoaccount the relative performance of each area.\nOur market risk limits are monitored by Market Risk\nManagement, which is responsible for identifying andescalating to senior management and/or the appropriaterisk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limitshave been exceeded. When a risk limit has been exceeded(e.g., due to positional changes or changes in marketconditions, such as increased volatilities or changes incorrelations), it is escalated to senior management and/orthe appropriate risk committee. Such instances areremediated by an inventory reduction and/or a temporaryor permanent increase to the risk limit.\nModel Review and Validation\nOur VaR and stress testing models are regularly reviewedby Market Risk Management and enhanced in order toincorporate changes in the composition of positionsincluded in our market risk measures, as well as variationsin market conditions. Prior to implementing significantchanges to our assumptions and/or models, Model RiskManagement performs model validations. Significantchanges to our VaR and stress testing models are reviewedwith our chief risk officer and chief financial officer, andapproved by the Risk Governance Committee.\nThese models are independently reviewed, validated and\napproved by Model Risk Management.

VaR excludes the impact of changes in\ncounterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, aswell as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuationadjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair valueoption was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basispoint increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own)on derivatives was a gain of $3 million (including hedges) asof both December 2018 and December 2017. In addition,the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in ourown credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fairvalue option was elected was a gain of $41 million as ofDecember 2018 and $35 million as of December 2017.However, the actual net impact of a change in our owncredit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration andconvexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes inyields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair valueoption was elected, as well as the relative performance ofany hedges undertaken.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. Loans receivable were\n$80.59 billion as of December 2018 and $65.93 billion asof December 2017, substantially all of which had floatinginterest rates. The estimated sensitivity to a 100 basis pointincrease in interest rates on such loans was $607 million asof December 2018 and $527 million as of December 2017,of additional interest income over a twelve-month period,which does not take into account the potential impact of anincrease in costs to fund such loans. See Note 9 to theconsolidated financial statem ents for further information\nabout loans receivable.\nOther Market Risk Considerations\nAs of both December 2018 and December 2017, we hadcommitments and held loans for which we have obtainedcredit loss protection from Sumitomo Mitsui FinancialGroup, Inc.

See Note 6 to the consolidated financialstatements for further information.\nWe also make investments accounted for under the equity\nmethod and we also make direct investments in real estate,both of which are included in other assets.

Ourexposure to credit risk comes mostly from clienttransactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lendingcommitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed withbanks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale andrepurchase agreements and securities borrowing andlending activities) and customer and other receivables.\nCredit Risk Management, which is independent of our\nrevenue-producing units and reports to our chief riskofficer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoringand managing our credit risk through firmwide oversightacross our global businesses. The Risk GovernanceCommittee reviews and approves credit policies andparameters. In addition, we hold other positions that giverise to credit risk (e.g., bonds held in our inventory andsecondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as acomponent of market risk measures, which are monitoredand managed by Market Risk Management, consistentwith other inventory positions. We also enter intoderivatives to manage market risk exposures. Suchderivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitoredand managed by Credit Risk Management.\nCredit Risk Management Process\nOur process for managing credit risk includes:\n\u2030Collecting complete, accurate and timely information;\n\u2030Approving transactions and setting and communicating\ncredit exposure limits;\n\u2030Monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits\nand reporting our exposure;\n\u2030Establishing or approving underwriting standards;\n\u2030Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default\non its payment obligations;\n\u2030Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and\nlosses resulting from counterparty default;\n\u2030Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and\nhedging;\n\u2030Maximizing recovery through active workout and\nrestructuring of claims; and\n\u2030Proactive communication between our revenue-\nproducing units and our independent risk oversight andcontrol functions.\nGoldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K 93", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3608, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26d226ea-41e7-494b-b437-3543842ac744": {"__data__": {"id_": "26d226ea-41e7-494b-b437-3543842ac744", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f78110e3-e04f-4dd2-85d4-45e4e18eda97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3219a4fc683cc62271083781b6f80a28f69c4ca5e8d57921417e04c44122441c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f848a71-83fa-4081-9bbd-3994fccd76f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1f15d81cf6fd94d50bd765b3e83156aac255539b9633e6a957d7740fb498df00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6017b94-ab06-4d7e-bceb-36576e62dfce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9594c495504de06fe2d945e3a91ef87febfd2f770908131d01cf42541db31ce9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bcf3c5591efbe8e71955474781837d54dabf2ba927ad0d0416c5a08da6864de2", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nAs part of the risk assessment process, Credit Risk\nManagement performs credit reviews, which include initialand ongoing analyses of our counterparties. Forsubstantially all of our credit exposures, the core of ourprocess is an annual counterparty credit review. A creditreview is an independent analysis of the capacity andwillingness of a counterparty to meet its financialobligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. Thedetermination of internal credit ratings also incorporatesassumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook forthe counterparty\u2019s industry, and the economicenvironment. Senior personnel within Credit RiskManagement, with expertise in specific industries, inspectand approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings.\nOur risk assessment process may also include, where\napplicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but notlimited to, delinquency status, collateral values, Fair IsaacCorporation credit scores and other risk factors.\nOur global credit risk management systems capture credit\nexposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregatebasis to counterparties and their subsidiaries (economicgroups). These systems also provide management withcomprehensive information about our aggregate credit riskby product, internal credit rating, industry, country andregion.\nRisk Measures and Limits\nWe measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in theevent of non-payment by a counterparty using current andpotential exposure. For derivatives and securities financingtransactions, current exposure represents the amountpresently owed to us after taking into account applicablenetting and collateral arrangements, while potentialexposure represents our estimate of the future exposurethat could arise over the life of a transaction based onmarket movements within a specified confidence level.Potential exposure also takes into account netting andcollateral arrangements. For loans and lendingcommitments, the primary measure is a function of thenotional amount of the position.\nThe Risk Committee of the Board and the Risk Governance\nCommittee approve credit risk limits at firmwide, businessand product levels, consistent with our risk appetitestatement. Credit Risk Management (through delegatedauthority from the Risk Governance Committee) sets creditlimits for individual counterparties, economic groups,industries and countries. Policies authorized by theFirmwide Enterprise Risk Committee and the RiskGovernance Committee prescribe the level of formalapproval required for us to assume credit exposure to acounterparty across all product areas, taking into accountany applicable netting provisions, collateral or other creditrisk mitigants.We use credit limits at various levels (e.g., counterparty,\neconomic group, industry and country), as well asunderwriting standards to control the size and nature of ourcredit exposures. Limits for counterparties and economicgroups are reviewed regularly and revised to reflectchanging risk appetites for a given counterparty or group ofcounterparties. Limits for industries and countries arebased on our risk appetite and are designed to allow forregular monitoring, review, escalation and management ofcredit risk concentrations.\nOur credit risk limits are monitored by Credit Risk\nManagement, which is responsible for identifying andescalating, on a timely basis, instances where limits havebeen exceeded. When a risk limit has been exceeded, it isescalated to senior management and/or the appropriate riskcommittee.\nStress Tests\nWe use regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures,including potential concentrations that would result fromapplying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit riskfactors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices).These shocks include a wide range of moderate and moreextreme market movements. Some of our stress testsinclude shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with theoccurrence of a severe market or economic event. In thecase of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact ofthe default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes toour credit exposures arising from potential market moves inresponse to the default, and the impact of credit marketdeterioration on corporate borrowers and counterpartiesthat may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potentialexposure, which is calculated within a specified confidencelevel, with a stress test there is generally no assumedprobability of these events occurring.\nWe perform stress tests on a regular basis as part of our\nroutine risk management processes and conduct tailoredstress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to marketdevelopments. We also perform stress tests that aredesigned to ensure a comprehensive analysis of ourvulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financialand nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit,market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance,strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a singlecombined scenario.\nModel Review and Validation\nOur potential credit exposure and stress testing models, andany changes to such models or assumptions, areindependently reviewed, validated and approved by ModelRisk Management.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nRisk Mitigants\nTo reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securitiesfinancing transactions, we may enter into nettingagreements with counterparties that permit us to offsetreceivables and payables with such counterparties. We mayalso reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering intoagreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them onan upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminatetransactions if the counterparty\u2019s credit rating falls below aspecified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral toensure that our credit exposures are appropriatelycollateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where thereis a significant positive correlation between thecreditworthiness of our counterparties and the marketvalue of collateral we receive.\nFor loans and lending commitments, depending on the\ncredit quality of the borrower and other characteristics ofthe transaction, we employ a variety of potential riskmitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions,guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loanclaims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions inthe legal documentation that allow us to adjust loanamounts, pricing, structure and other terms as marketconditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigantsemployed can significantly influence the degree of creditrisk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into a\ncounterparty\u2019s financial strength or when we believe acounterparty requires support from its parent, we mayobtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty\u2019sobligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk usingcredit derivatives or participation agreements.\nCredit Exposures\nAs of December 2018, our aggregate credit exposureincreased as compared with December 2017, primarilyreflecting an increase in cash deposits with central banksand loans and lending commitments, partially offset by adecrease in secured financing transactions. The percentageof our credit exposures arising from non-investment-gradecounterparties (based on our internally determined publicrating agency equivalents) increased as compared withDecember 2017, reflecting an increase in non-investment-grade loans and lending commitments. Our credit exposureto counterparties that defaulted during 2018 was lower ascompared with our credit exposure to counterparties thatdefaulted during the prior year, and substantially all of suchexposure was related to loans and lending commitments.Our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during2018 remained low, representing less than 0.5% of ourtotal credit exposure, and estimated losses compared withthe prior year were lower and not material. Our creditexposures are described further below.Cash and Cash E quivalents. Our credit exposure on cash\nand cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, andincludes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearingdeposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we placesubstantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks andcentral banks.\nThe table below presents credit exposure from unrestricted\ncash and cash equivalents, and the concentration byindustry, region and credit quality.\nAs of December\n$ in millions 2018 2017\nCash and Cash E quivalents $107,408 $91,609\nIndustry\nFinancial Institutions 16% 17%\nSovereign 84% 83%\nTotal 100% 100%\nRegion\nAmericas 36% 64%\nEurope, Middle East and Africa 41% 22%\nAsia 23% 14%\nTotal 100% 100%\nCredit Quality (Credit Rating E quivalent)\nAAA 62% 72%\nAA 10% 9%\nA 27% 18%\nBBB 1% 1%\nTotal 100% 100%\nThe table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory\nand other purposes of $23.14 billion as of December 2018and $18.44 billion as of December 2017.\nOTC Derivatives. Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives\narises primarily from our market-making activities. As amarket maker, we enter into derivative transactions toprovide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer andhedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives tomanage market risk exposures. We manage our creditexposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process,measures, limits and risk mitigants described above.\nWe generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under\nbilateral collateral arrangements that require the dailyexchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essentialcomponent of fair value, we include a credit valuationadjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflectcounterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to theconsolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of thepresent value of expected exposure, the probability ofcounterparty default and the assumed recovery upondefault.\nGoldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K 95", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4769, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee5ac25b-db35-4dba-b7d8-1b63c208c4e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee5ac25b-db35-4dba-b7d8-1b63c208c4e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "624d63bf-4f0c-444d-bbcf-8d72380621ee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8c9805e4ff380984d45cbb34b37d70e9ec9c1ca244f8a42b4050e90561805106", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6017b94-ab06-4d7e-bceb-36576e62dfce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9594c495504de06fe2d945e3a91ef87febfd2f770908131d01cf42541db31ce9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca65e57f-fba7-417e-b0a4-406f16546b5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "efe34e044a637ef5245c5f448e2b6aa4c81b46f2bf876424a0114bfbb44a3a6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b506a4a4c17a902e71a31961186cf1628ef4f2ba8084ddcd3a6b93d54c86a59b", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

From a top-downperspective, our senior management assesses firmwide andbusiness-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-upperspective, our first and second lines of defense areresponsible for risk identification and risk management ona day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks tosenior management.\nOur operational risk management framework is in part\ndesigned to comply with the operational risk measurementrules under the Capital Framework and has evolved basedon the changing needs of our businesses and regulatoryguidance.\nOur operational risk management framework consists of\nthe following practices:\n\u2030Risk identification and assessment;\n\u2030Risk measurement; and\n\u2030Risk monitoring and reporting.\nRisk Identification and Assessment\nThe core of our operational risk management framework isrisk identification and assessment. We have acomprehensive data collection process, including firmwidepolicies and procedures, for operational risk events.\nWe have established policies that require all employees to\nreport and escalate operational risk events. Whenoperational risk events are identified, our policies requirethat the events be documented and analyzed to determinewhether changes are required in our systems and/orprocesses to further mitigate the risk of future events.\nWe use operational risk management applications to capture\nand organize operational risk event data and key metrics.One of our key risk identification and assessment tools is anoperational risk and control self-assessment process, which isperformed by our managers. This process consists of theidentification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from thisprocess are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposuresand identify businesses, activities or products withheightened levels of operational risk.\nRisk Measurement\nWe measure our operational risk exposure using bothstatistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involvequalitative and quantitative assessments of internal andexternal operational risk event data and internal controlfactors for each of our businesses. Operational riskmeasurement also incorporates an assessment of businessenvironment factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2030Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities;\n\u2030The degree of automation in our processes;\u2030New activity information;\n\u2030The legal and regulatory environment; and\n\u2030Changes in the markets for our products and services,\nincluding the diversity and sophistication of ourcustomers and counterparties.\nThe results from these scenario analyses are used to\nmonitor changes in operational risk and to determinebusiness lines that may have heightened exposure tooperational risk. These analyses are used in thedetermination of the appropriate level of operational riskcapital to hold.\nStress Tests\nWe perform stress tests on a regular basis as part of ourroutine risk management processes. We also perform stresstests that are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysisof our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combiningfinancial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limitedto, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational andcompliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into asingle combined scenario.\nRisk Monitoring and Reporting\nWe evaluate changes in our operational risk profile and ourbusinesses, including changes in business mix orjurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring the factorsnoted above at a firmwide level. We have both preventiveand detective internal controls, which are designed toreduce the frequency and severity of operational risk lossesand the probability of operational risk events.

This reviewincludes an analysis of the model documentation,independent testing, an assessment of the appropriatenessof the methodology used, and verification of compliancewith model development and implementation standards.Model Risk Management reviews all existing models on anannual basis, and approves new models or significantchanges to models prior to implementation.The model validation process incorporates a review of\nmodels and trade and risk parameters across a broad rangeof scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order tocritically evaluate and verify:\n\u2030The model\u2019s conceptual soundness, including the\nreasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability forintended use;\n\u2030The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to\nensure that the models function as intended;\n\u2030The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated\nin the model;\n\u2030The model\u2019s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of\nthe related product and its significant risks;\n\u2030The model\u2019s consistency with models for similar\nproducts; and\n\u2030The model\u2019s sensitivity to input parameters and\nassumptions.\nSee \u201cCritical Accounting Policies \u2014 Fair Value \u2014 Review\nof Valuation Models,\u201d \u201cLiquidity Risk Management,\u201d\u201cMarket Risk Management,\u201d \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201dand \u201cOperational Risk Management\u201d for furtherinformation about our use of models within these areas.\nGoldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K 101", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2838, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37dd21e6-8542-4d53-84da-409740105ac1": {"__data__": {"id_": "37dd21e6-8542-4d53-84da-409740105ac1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ba98dde-a20b-4ecb-9349-0a1c1ce3551b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "165cb850cb5cf11b87404efcd118758c42e106ee755c1e7cab09cdc4716190c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c64804b5-244c-428a-a998-8e224a8d7383", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "73f1a063cca5b944bb8ca0eb0e32fd7398b701feff35c9642efea61a03b4905f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "79677576-9356-4c04-84c2-7b95081744d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "704d69018b978f66c65d3ff74ae5a7366a0b4e8309037fe79b61eb4569909433", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bd68bd01940928ab392231e0b501c661149f9c22167ed3e10dd2689190d03704", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm determines whetherit has a controlling financial interest in an entity by firstevaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or avariable interest entity (VIE).\nVoting Interest Entities. Voting interest entities are\nentities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk issufficient to enable the entity to finance its activitiesindependently and (ii) the equity holders have the power todirect the activities of the entity that most significantlyimpact its economic performance, the obligation to absorbthe losses of the entity and the right to receive the residualreturns of the entity. The usual condition for a controllingfinancial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of amajority voting interest. If the firm has a controllingmajority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entityis consolidated.\nVariable Interest Entities. A VIE is an entity that lacks\none or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE whenthe firm has a variable interest or interests that provide itwith (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE thatmost significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performanceand (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or theright to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentiallybe significant to the VIE. See Note 12 for furtherinformation about VIEs.\nEquity-Method Investments. When the firm does not\nhave a controlling financial interest in an entity but canexert significant influence over the entity\u2019s operating andfinancial policies, the investment is accounted for either(i) under the equity method of accounting or (ii) at fair valueby electing the fair value option available under U.S. GAAP.Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock or in-substancecommon stock.\nIn general, the firm accounts for investments acquired after\nthe fair value option became available, at fair value. Incertain cases, the firm applies the equity method ofaccounting to new investments that are strategic in natureor closely related to the firm\u2019s principal business activities,when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in thecash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed numerous\ninvestment funds with third-party investors. These fundsare typically organized as limited partnerships or limitedliability companies for which the firm acts as generalpartner or manager. Generally, the firm does not hold amajority of the economic interests in these funds. Thesefunds are usually voting interest entities and generally arenot consolidated because third-party investors typicallyhave rights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm asgeneral partner or manager. Investments in these funds aregenerally measured at net asset value (NAV) and areincluded in financial instruments owned. See Notes 6, 18and 22 for further information about investments in funds.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of these consolidated financial statementsrequires management to make certain estimates andassumptions, the most important of which relate to fairvalue measurements, accounting for goodwill andidentifiable intangible assets, the allowance for credit losseson loans receivable and lending commitments held forinvestment, provisions for losses that may arise fromlitigation and regulatory proceedings (includinggovernmental investigations), and provisions for losses thatmay arise from tax audits. These estimates and assumptionsare based on the best available information but actualresults could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Fair Value.Financial instruments owned and financial instrumentssold, but not yet purchased are recorded at fair value eitherunder the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S.GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account forcertain of its other financial assets and financial liabilities atfair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value ofa financial instrument is the amount that would be receivedto sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderlytransaction between market participants at themeasurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid pricesand financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fairvalue measurements do not include transaction costs. Fairvalue gains or losses are generally included in marketmaking for positions in Institutional Client Services andother principal transactions for positions in Investing &Lending. See Notes 5 through 8 for further informationabout fair value measurements.Revenue from Contracts with Clients.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInvestment Management\nThe firm earns management fees and incentive fees forinvestment management services, which are included ininvestment management revenues. The firm makespayments to brokers and advisors related to the placementof the firm\u2019s investment funds (distribution fees), which areincluded in brokerage, clearing, exchange and distributionfees.\nManagement Fees. Management fees for mutual funds\nare calculated as a percentage of daily net asset value andare received monthly. Management fees for hedge fundsand separately managed accounts are calculated as apercentage of month-end net asset value and are generallyreceived quarterly. Management fees for private equityfunds are calculated as a percentage of monthly investedcapital or committed capital and are received quarterly,semi-annually or annually, depending on the fund.Management fees are recognized over time in the period theinvestment management services are provided.\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on\neither a percentage of the management fee, the investmentfund\u2019s net asset value or the committed capital. Beginningin January 2018, the firm presents such fees in brokerage,clearing, exchange and distribution fees. Prior toJanuary 2018, where the firm was considered an agent tothe arrangement, such fees were presented on a net basis ininvestment management revenues.\nIncentive Fees. Incentive fees are calculated as a\npercentage of a fund\u2019s or separately managed account\u2019sreturn, or excess return above a specified benchmark orother performance target. Incentive fees are generally basedon investment performance over a twelve-month period orover the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performanceover a twelve-month period are subject to adjustment priorto the end of the measurement period. For fees that arebased on investment performance over the life of the fund,future investment underperformance may require feespreviously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund.\nBeginning in January 2018, incentive fees earned from a\nfund or separately managed account are recognized when itis probable that a significant reversal of such fees will notoccur, which is generally when such fees are no longersubject to fluctuations in the market value of investmentsheld by the fund or separately managed account. Therefore,incentive fees recognized during the period may relate toperformance obligations satisfied in previous periods. Priorto January 2018, incentive fees were recognized only whenall material contingencies were resolved.Commissions and Fees\nThe firm earns commissions and fees from executing andclearing client transactions on stock, options and futuresmarkets, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade isexecuted. The firm also provides third-party researchservices to clients in connection with certain soft-dollararrangements.\nBeginning in January 2018, third-party research costs\nincurred by the firm in connection with soft-dollararrangements are presented net within commissions andfees. Prior to January 2018, such costs were presented inbrokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations are services that thefirm has committed to perform in the future in connectionwith its contracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remainingperformance obligations are generally related to itsfinancial advisory assignments and certain investmentmanagement activities. Revenues associated with remainingperformance obligations relating to financial advisoryassignments cannot be determined until the outcome of thetransaction. For the firm\u2019s investment managementactivities, where fees are calculated based on the net assetvalue of the fund or separately managed account, futurerevenues associated with remaining performanceobligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject tofluctuations in the market value of investments held by thefund or separately managed account.\nThe firm is able to determine the future revenues associated\nwith management fees calculated based on committedcapital. As of December 2018, substantially all of the firm\u2019sfuture net revenues associated with remaining performanceobligations will be recognized through 2024. Annualrevenues associated with such performance obligationsaverage less than $250 million through 2024.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales whenthe firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred.For transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, anygains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets orliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s continuing involvementwith transferred financial assets are initially recognized atfair value. For transfers of financial assets that are notaccounted for as sales, the assets are generally included infinancial instruments owned and the transfer is accountedfor as a collateralized financing, with the related interestexpense recognized over the life of the transaction.

As a result of adoptingthis ASU, the firm, among other things, delays recognitionof non-refundable and milestone payments on financialadvisory assignments until the assignments are completed,and recognizes certain investment management fees earlierthan under the firm\u2019s previous revenue recognition policies.The firm also prospectively changed the presentation of\ncertain costs from a net presentation within revenues to agross basis, and vice versa. Beginning in 2018, certainunderwriting expenses, which were netted againstinvestment banking revenues, and certain distribution fees,which were netted against investment managementrevenues, are presented gross as operating expenses. Costsincurred in connection with certain soft-dollararrangements, which were presented gross as operatingexpenses, are presented net within commissions and fees.\nThe cumulative effect of adopting this ASU as of\nJanuary 1, 2018 was a decrease to retained earnings of$53 million (net of tax). In addition, net revenues andoperating expenses were both higher by approximately$300 million for 2018, due to the changes in thepresentation of certain costs from a net presentation withinrevenues to a gross basis.\nRecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets\nand Financial Liabilities (ASC 825).

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm adopted this ASU in January 2019 under a\nmodified retrospective approach. The impact of adoptingthis ASU was a gross up of $1.77 billion on the firm\u2019sconsolidated statements of financial condition and anincrease to retained earnings of $12 million (net of tax) asof January 1, 2019.\nImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment\nAccounting (ASC 718). In March 2016, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2016-09, \u201cCompensation \u2014 Stock Compensation(Topic 718) \u2014 Improvements to Employee Share-BasedPayment Accounting.\u201d This ASU includes a requirementthat the tax effect related to the settlement of share-basedawards be recorded in income tax benefit or expense in thestatements of earnings rather than directly to additionalpaid-in capital. This change has no impact on totalshareholders\u2019 equity and is required to be adoptedprospectively. The ASU also allows for forfeitures to berecorded when they occur rather than estimated over thevesting period. This change is required to be applied on amodified retrospective basis.\nThe firm adopted the ASU in January 2017 and subsequent\nto the adoption, the tax effect related to the settlement ofshare-based awards is recognized in the statements ofearnings rather than directly to additional paid-in capital.The firm also elected to account for forfeitures as theyoccur, rather than to estimate forfeitures over the vestingperiod, and the cumulative effect of this election uponadoption was an increase of $35 million to share-basedawards and a decrease of $24 million (net of tax of$11 million) to retained earnings.\nIn addition, the ASU modifies the classification of certain\nshare-based payment activities within the statements ofcash flows. Upon adoption, the firm reclassified amountsrelated to such activities within the consolidated statementsof cash flows, on a retrospective basis.\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments (ASC 326). In June 2016, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses(Topic 326) \u2014 Measurement of Credit Losses on FinancialInstruments.\u201d This ASU amends several aspects of themeasurement of credit losses on financial instruments,including replacing the existing incurred credit loss modeland other models with the Current Expected Credit Losses(CECL) model and amending certain aspects of accountingfor purchased financial assets with deterioration in creditquality since origination.Under CECL, the allowance for losses for financial assets\nthat are measured at amortized cost reflects management\u2019sestimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life ofthe financial assets. Expected credit losses for newlyrecognized financial assets, as well as changes to expectedcredit losses during the period, would be recognized inearnings. For certain purchased financial assets withdeterioration in credit quality since origination, an initialallowance would be recorded for expected credit losses andrecognized as an increase to the purchase price rather thanas an expense. The ASU eliminates the existing accountingguidance for Purchased Credit Impaired (PCI) loans. TheASU is effective for the firm in January 2020 under amodified retrospective approach with early adoptionpermitted beginning in January 2019. The firm plans toadopt this ASU on January 1, 2020.\nExpected credit losses, including losses on off-balance-sheet\nexposures such as lending commitments, will be measuredbased on historical experience, current conditions andforecasts that affect the collectability of the reportedamount.\nThe firm has substantially completed development of credit\nloss models for its significant loan portfolios and is in theprocess of validating data inputs to these models, whilecontinuing to develop the policies, systems and controlsthat will be required to implement CECL. The firmcurrently expects to begin testing of these models in the firsthalf of 2019. The firm currently expects that its allowancefor credit losses will likely increase when CECL is adoptedas the allowance will cover expected credit losses over thefull expected life of the loan portfolios and will also takeinto account expected changes in future economicconditions. In addition, an allowance will be recorded forcertain purchased loans with deterioration in credit qualitysince origination with a corresponding increase to theirgross carrying value. The extent of the impact of adoptionof this ASU on the firm\u2019s financial condition, results ofoperations and cash flows will depend on, among otherthings, the economic environment, and the size and type ofloan portfolios held by the firm on the date of adoption.\nClassification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash\nPayments (ASC 230).

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 5.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer aliability in an orderly transaction between marketparticipants at the measurement date. Financial assets aremarked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked tooffer prices. Fair value measurements do not includetransaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assetsand financial liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its netexposure to market and/or credit risks).\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active\nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are not available,fair value is determined by reference to prices for similarinstruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in lessactive markets, or internally developed models thatprimarily use market-based or independently sourcedinputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates,volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e.,the spread or difference between the interest rate at which aborrower could finance a given financial instrument relativeto a benchmark interest rate).\nU.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair\nvalue measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to thevaluation techniques used to measure fair value, giving thehighest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority tolevel 3 inputs. A financial instrument\u2019s level in thishierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that issignificant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating thesignificance of a valuation input, the firm considers, amongother factors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to that input.The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active\nmarkets to which the firm had access at the measurementdate for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2. Inputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3. One or more inputs to valuation techniques are\nsignificant and unobservable.The fair values for substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial\nassets and financial liabilities are based on observable pricesand inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fairvalue hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assetsand financial liabilities may require appropriate valuationadjustments that a market participant would require toarrive at fair value for factors such as counterparty and thefirm\u2019s credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions,liquidity and bid/offer spreads.

See belowfor the types of cash instruments included in each level ofthe fair value hierarchy and the valuation techniques andsignificant inputs used to determine their fair values. SeeNote 5 for an overview of the firm\u2019s fair value measurementpolicies.\nLevel 1 Cash Instruments\nLevel 1 cash instruments include certain money marketinstruments, U.S. government obligations, most non-U.S.government obligations, certain government agencyobligations, certain corporate debt instruments and activelytraded listed equities. These instruments are valued usingquoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments inactive markets.\nThe firm defines active markets for equity instruments\nbased on the average daily trading volume both in absoluteterms and relative to the market capitalization for theinstrument. The firm defines active markets for debtinstruments based on both the average daily trading volumeand the number of days with trading activity.Level 2 Cash Instruments\nLevel 2 cash instruments include most money marketinstruments, most government agency obligations, certainnon-U.S. government obligations, most mortgage-backedloans and securities, most corporate debt instruments, moststate and municipal obligations, most other debtobligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities,commodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 cash instruments can be verified to\nquoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similarinstruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternativepricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g.,indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent marketactivity to the prices provided from alternative pricingsources.\nValuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 cash\ninstruments (i) if the cash instrument is subject to transferrestrictions and/or (ii) for other premiums and liquiditydiscounts that a market participant would require to arriveat fair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based onmarket evidence.\nLevel 3 Cash Instruments\nLevel 3 cash instruments have one or more significantvaluation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence tothe contrary, level 3 cash instruments are initially valued attransaction price, which is considered to be the best initialestimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses othermethodologies to determine fair value, which vary based onthe type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptionsare changed when corroborated by substantive observableevidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation Techni ques and Significant Inputs of\nLevel 3 Cash InstrumentsValuation techniques of level 3 cash instruments vary byinstrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flowtechniques. The valuation techniques and the nature ofsignificant inputs used to determine the fair values of eachtype of level 3 cash instrument are described below:\nLoans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real\nEstate. Loans and securities backed by commercial real\nestate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a singlecommercial real estate property or a portfolio of properties,and may include tranches of varying levels ofsubordination.

Forexample, the highest multiple for private equity securitiesis appropriate for valuing a specific private equity securitybut may not be appropriate for valuing any other privateequity security. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do notrepresent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair valuemeasurements of level 3 cash instruments.\n\u2030Increases in yield, discount rate, capitalization rate,\nduration or cumulative loss rate used in the valuation oflevel 3 cash instruments would have resulted in a lowerfair value measurement, while increases in recovery rateor multiples would have resulted in a higher fair valuemeasurement as of both December 2018 andDecember 2017. Due to the distinctive nature of eachlevel 3 cash instrument, the interrelationship of inputs isnot necessarily uniform within each product type.\n\u2030Loans and securities backed by commercial and\nresidential real estate, corporate debt instruments andother cash instruments are valued using discounted cashflows, and equity securities are valued using marketcomparables and discounted cash flows.\n\u2030The fair value of any one instrument may be determined\nusing multiple valuation techniques. For example, marketcomparables and discounted cash flows may be usedtogether to determine fair value.

Such losses were not material as ofDecember 2017.\n\u2030Available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position\nare periodically reviewed for other-than-temporaryimpairment. The firm considers various factors, includingmarket conditions, changes in issuer credit ratings,severity and duration of the unrealized losses, and theintent and ability to hold the security until recovery todetermine if the securities are other-than-temporarilyimpaired. There were no such impairments during either2018 or 2017.Investments in Funds at Net Asset Value Per Share\nCash instruments at fair value include investments in fundsthat are measured at NAV of the investment fund. The firmuses NAV to measure the fair value of its fund investmentswhen (i) the fund investment does not have a readilydeterminable fair value and (ii) the NAV of the investmentfund is calculated in a manner consistent with themeasurement principles of investment companyaccounting, including measurement of the investments atfair value.\nSubstantially all of the firm\u2019s investments in funds at NAV\nconsist of investments in firm-sponsored private equity,credit, real estate and hedge funds where the firm co-investswith third-party investors.\nPrivate equity funds primarily invest in a broad range of\nindustries worldwide, including leveraged buyouts,recapitalizations, growth investments and distressedinvestments. Credit funds generally invest in loans andother fixed income instruments and are focused onproviding private high-yield capital for leveraged andmanagement buyout transactions, recapitalizations,financings, refinancings, acquisitions and restructurings forprivate equity firms, private family companies andcorporate issuers. Real estate funds invest globally,primarily in real estate companies, loan portfolios, debtrecapitalizations and property. Private equity, credit andreal estate funds are closed-end funds in which the firm\u2019sinvestments are generally not eligible for redemption.Distributions will be received from these funds as theunderlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing ofwhich is uncertain.\nThe firm also invests in hedge funds, primarily multi-\ndisciplinary hedge funds that employ a fundamentalbottom-up investment approach across various asset classesand strategies. The firm\u2019s investments in hedge fundsprimarily include interests where the underlying assets areilliquid in nature, and proceeds from redemptions will notbe received until the underlying assets are liquidated ordistributed, the timing of which is uncertain.\nGoldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K 123", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4036, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a211f20-ef32-41f4-ad17-d4737939579e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a211f20-ef32-41f4-ad17-d4737939579e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12500755-2692-4b07-abec-049a367e48ad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "076d8cf20554b33a742af512eba34c19867177167eef9b02e80c93430c68ae82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1064cc91-648f-4154-a943-276666c1488e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "432a827cdbd8a1dbf3c571038d46c283e39d735a3d7e79747cafcaa28b6b99d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4910db9-a97d-4531-b4ba-6fa2564c119a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51e2dbce052d16e78a21ca0f64bea42ef6ea2e889bb406c2b1fedf6734e0a5d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0c66d4c9463b5de5eac1f14141d67789666d42f9c768f553ecb55fc344c1331d", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Derivatives maybe traded on an exchange (exchange-traded) or they may beprivately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred toas OTC derivatives. Certain of the firm\u2019s OTC derivativesare cleared and settled through central clearingcounterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are bilateralcontracts between two counterparties (bilateral OTC).\nMarket Making. As a market maker, the firm enters into\nderivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and tofacilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role,the firm typically acts as principal and is required to commitcapital to provide execution, and maintains inventory inresponse to, or in anticipation of, client demand.Risk Management. The firm also enters into derivatives to\nactively manage risk exposures that arise from its market-making and investing and lending activities in derivativeand cash instruments. The firm\u2019s holdings and exposuresare hedged, in many cases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to an instrument-by-instrumentbasis. The offsetting impact of this economic hedging isreflected in the same business segment as the relatedrevenues. In addition, the firm may enter into derivativesdesignated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These derivativesare used to manage interest rate exposure in certain fixed-rate unsecured long-term and short-term borrowings, anddeposits, and to manage foreign currency exposure on thenet investment in certain non-U.S. operations.\nThe firm enters into various types of derivatives, including:\u2030Futures and Forwards. Contracts that commit\ncounterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments,commodities or currencies in the future.\n\u2030Swaps. Contracts that require counterparties to\nexchange cash flows such as currency or interest paymentstreams. The amounts exchanged are based on thespecific terms of the contract with reference to specifiedrates, financial instruments, commodities, currencies orindices.\n\u2030Options. Contracts in which the option purchaser has\nthe right, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sellto the option writer financial instruments, commoditiesor currencies within a defined time period for a specifiedprice.\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis\n(i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets andliabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right ofsetoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement(counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fairvalue, net of cash collateral received or posted underenforceable credit support agreements (cash collateralnetting). Derivative assets are included in financialinstruments owned and derivative liabilities are included infinancial instruments sold, but not yet purchased. Realizedand unrealized gains and losses on derivatives notdesignated as hedges are included in market making andother principal transactions in Note 4.\n124 Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4261, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4910db9-a97d-4531-b4ba-6fa2564c119a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4910db9-a97d-4531-b4ba-6fa2564c119a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "058e75d9-2f91-4c38-8405-2adc096a4a7b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1faff1f65db3ccdad2d745464e57646fc9d7cac0dc51ec4cc3f8b08bec0ab254", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a211f20-ef32-41f4-ad17-d4737939579e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0c66d4c9463b5de5eac1f14141d67789666d42f9c768f553ecb55fc344c1331d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0807bba0-3896-45d6-993f-a0953862938b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e8242306eeb3fa66484aa9c1a1e233e82672154d236fc57d33f4df0c82a0bb7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "51e2dbce052d16e78a21ca0f64bea42ef6ea2e889bb406c2b1fedf6734e0a5d6", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\u2030On November 19, 2018, a clearing organization revised\nits rules to calculate notional amounts for certainexchange-traded derivative contracts. The impact of thisrule change, as of the effective date, was a decrease in thenotional amounts of derivative contracts ofapproximately $7 trillion, substantially all of whichrelated to interest rate derivatives, with no change to theirfair value.\nValuation Techni ques for Derivatives\nThe firm\u2019s level 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued usingderivative pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flowmodels, correlation models, and models that incorporateoption pricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlosimulations). Price transparency of derivatives can generallybe characterized by product type, as described below.\n\u2030Interest Rate. In general, the key inputs used to value\ninterest rate derivatives are transparent, even for mostlong-dated contracts. Interest rate swaps and optionsdenominated in the currencies of leading industrializednations are characterized by high trading volumes andtight bid/offer spreads. Interest rate derivatives thatreference indices, such as an inflation index, or the shapeof the yield curve (e.g., 10-year swap rate vs. 2-year swaprate) are more complex, but the key inputs are generallyobservable.\n\u2030Credit. Price transparency for credit default swaps,\nincluding both single names and baskets of credits, variesby market and underlying reference entity or obligation.Credit default swaps that reference indices, largecorporates and major sovereigns generally exhibit themost price transparency. For credit default swaps withother underliers, price transparency varies based on creditrating, the cost of borrowing the underlying referenceobligations, and the availability of the underlyingreference obligations for delivery upon the default of theissuer. Credit default swaps that reference loans, asset-backed securities and emerging market debt instrumentstend to have less price transparency than those thatreference corporate bonds. In addition, more complexcredit derivatives, such as those sensitive to thecorrelation between two or more underlying referenceobligations, generally have less price transparency.\n\u2030Currency. Prices for currency derivatives based on the\nexchange rates of leading industrialized nations,including those with longer tenors, are generallytransparent. The primary difference between the pricetransparency of developed and emerging market currencyderivatives is that emerging markets tend to be observablefor contracts with shorter tenors.\u2030Commodity. Commodity derivatives include\ntransactions referenced to energy (e.g., oil and naturalgas), metals (e.g., precious and base) and softcommodities (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency variesbased on the underlying commodity, delivery location,tenor and product quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared tounleaded gasoline). In general, price transparency forcommodity derivatives is greater for contracts withshorter tenors and contracts that are more closely alignedwith major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n\u2030Equity. Price transparency for equity derivatives varies by\nmarket and underlier. Options on indices and thecommon stock of corporates included in major equityindices exhibit the most price transparency. Equityderivatives generally have observable market prices,except for contracts with long tenors or reference pricesthat differ significantly from current market prices. Morecomplex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to thecorrelation between two or more individual stocks,generally have less price transparency.\nLiquidity is essential to observability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously transparent pricesand other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely,even highly structured products may at times have tradingvolumes large enough to provide observability of prices andother inputs. See Note 5 for an overview of the firm\u2019s fairvalue measurement policies.\nLevel 1 Derivatives\nLevel 1 derivatives include short-term contracts for futuredelivery of securities when the underlying security is alevel 1 instrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if theyare actively traded and are valued at their quoted marketprice.\nLevel 2 Derivatives\nLevel 2 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which allsignificant valuation inputs are corroborated by marketevidence and exchange-traded derivatives that are notactively traded and/or that are valued using models thatcalibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives.\nThe selection of a particular model to value a derivative\ndepends on the contractual terms of and specific risksinherent in the instrument, as well as the availability ofpricing information in the market. For derivatives thattrade in liquid markets, model selection does not involvesignificant management judgment because outputs ofmodels can be calibrated to market-clearing levels.\n126 Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5034, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4679bc32-a585-4cc2-b14c-cc18a98f03c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "4679bc32-a585-4cc2-b14c-cc18a98f03c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "096c0712-274e-4222-8295-d5a229a17687", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ec47861d4cb7907b84b31a6b4db2da3f423b36ba67a229691710f8c49f13c296", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ab88a3e-f3ba-47d0-8a63-770a27f53f8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "58c58dadd4215e0a73c72490efdc1ae6b2218f6b1619a92b4af281f3e7a42735", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff20991e-e04d-4ca5-8cd2-19e1e067ce4d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7e7527ebfada0f463c3aac70c8079ef6877da9edab05a7ec05ba6c9ba3cad647", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cd91a1608bc1f6d739bd855d0f5bb56c96d6cca62cb5bd9cf0baaa6ed0d49b42", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Significant inputs to thevaluations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to markettransactions, broker or dealer quotations or otheralternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of pricetransparency. Consideration is given to the nature of thequotations (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship ofrecent market activity to the prices provided fromalternative pricing sources.\nLevel 3 Derivatives\nLevel 3 derivatives are valued using models which utilizeobservable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as well asunobservable level 3 inputs. The significant unobservableinputs used to value the firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives aredescribed below.\n\u2030For level 3 interest rate and currency derivatives,\nsignificant unobservable inputs include correlations ofcertain currencies and interest rates (e.g., the correlationbetween Euro inflation and Euro interest rates). Inaddition, for level 3 interest rate derivatives, significantunobservable inputs include specific interest ratevolatilities.\n\u2030For level 3 credit derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and upfront creditpoints, which are unique to specific reference obligationsand reference entities, recovery rates and certaincorrelations required to value credit derivatives (e.g., thelikelihood of default of the underlying referenceobligation relative to one another).\n\u2030For level 3 commodity derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include volatilities for options withstrike prices that differ significantly from current marketprices and prices or spreads for certain products for whichthe product quality or physical location of the commodityis not aligned with benchmark indices.\n\u2030For level 3 equity derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs generally include equity volatility inputs foroptions that are long-dated and/or have strike prices thatdiffer significantly from current market prices. Inaddition, the valuation of certain structured tradesrequires the use of level 3 correlation inputs, such as thecorrelation of the price performance of two or moreindividual stocks or the correlation of the priceperformance for a basket of stocks to another asset classsuch as commodities.Subsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative,\nthe firm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflectobservable market changes and any resulting gains andlosses are classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changedwhen corroborated by evidence such as similar markettransactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker ordealer quotations or other empirical market data. Incircumstances where the firm cannot verify the model valueby reference to market transactions, it is possible that adifferent valuation model could produce a materiallydifferent estimate of fair value. See below for furtherinformation about significant unobservable inputs used inthe valuation of level 3 derivatives.\nValuation Adjustments\nValuation adjustments are integral to determining the fairvalue of derivative portfolios and are used to adjust themid-market valuations produced by derivative pricingmodels to the appropriate exit price valuation.

Forexample, the highest correlation for interest ratederivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interestrate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing anyother interest rate derivative. Accordingly, the ranges ofinputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible rangesof, fair value measurements of level 3 derivatives.\n\u2030Interest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are\nvalued using option pricing models, credit derivatives arevalued using option pricing, correlation and discountedcash flow models, and commodities derivatives are valuedusing option pricing and discounted cash flow models.\n\u2030The fair value of any one instrument may be determined\nusing multiple valuation techniques. For example, optionpricing models and discounted cash flows models aretypically used together to determine fair value. Therefore,the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques.\n\u2030Correlation was not significant to the valuation of level 3\ncredit derivatives as of December 2018.\n\u2030Correlation within currencies and equities includes cross-\nproduct type correlation.\n\u2030Natural gas spread represents the spread per million\nBritish thermal units of natural gas.\n\u2030Oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and\nrefined products.\nRange of Significant Unobservable Inputs\nThe following is information about the ranges of significantunobservable inputs used to value the firm\u2019s level 3derivative instruments:\n\u2030Correlation. Ranges for correlation cover a variety of\nunderliers both within one product type (e.g., equityindex and equity single stock names) and across producttypes (e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency),as well as across regions. Generally, cross-product typecorrelation inputs are used to value more complexinstruments and are lower than correlation inputs onassets within the same derivative product type.\n\u2030Volatility. Ranges for volatility cover numerous\nunderliers across a variety of markets, maturities andstrike prices. For example, volatility of equity indices isgenerally lower than volatility of single stocks.\u2030Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery\nrates. The ranges for credit spreads, upfront credit points\nand recovery rates cover a variety of underliers (index andsingle names), regions, sectors, maturities and creditqualities (high-yield and investment-grade). The broadrange of this population gives rise to the width of theranges of significant unobservable inputs.\n\u2030Commodity prices and spreads. The ranges for\ncommodity prices and spreads cover variability inproducts, maturities and delivery locations.\nSensitivity of Fair Value Measurement to Changes\nin Significant Unobservable InputsThe following is a description of the directional sensitivityof the firm\u2019s level 3 fair value measurements, as of bothDecember 2018 and December 2017, to changes insignificant unobservable inputs, in isolation:\n\u2030Correlation. In general, for contracts where the holder\nbenefits from the convergence of the underlying asset orindex prices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, foreignexchange rates, inflation rates and equity prices), anincrease in correlation results in a higher fair valuemeasurement.\n\u2030Volatility. In general, for purchased options, an increase\nin volatility results in a higher fair value measurement.\n\u2030Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery\nrates. In general, the fair value of purchased credit\nprotection increases as credit spreads or upfront creditpoints increase or recovery rates decrease. Credit spreads,upfront credit points and recovery rates are stronglyrelated to distinctive risk factors of the underlyingreference obligations, which include reference entity-specific factors such as leverage, volatility and industry,market-based risk factors, such as borrowing costs orliquidity of the underlying reference obligation, andmacroeconomic conditions.\n\u2030Commodity prices and spreads. In general, for\ncontracts where the holder is receiving a commodity, anincrease in the spread (price difference from a benchmarkindex due to differences in quality or delivery location) orprice results in a higher fair value measurement.\nDue to the distinctive nature of each of the firm\u2019s level 3\nderivatives, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarilyuniform within each product type.\nGoldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K 129", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4571, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50619bc2-50ce-45b4-b50a-acce90d975bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "50619bc2-50ce-45b4-b50a-acce90d975bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bf483792-1158-4aae-aeaf-a9556795a654", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "86be31ce5427948e1148b5f33d4143600ff65c8da4865c47afc5d4f056a430ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d764d59-a99f-408b-bd11-a820af2ec08f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "04d7c495766df7affb465fb00fc479c3499c69d1a87c1cee7601d3f756e9e160", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3645f6d0-0066-4f71-9b99-b18050ee5ac5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7822e8b649a0ede809a103d0bde6d23668acca57a9656ba3b354155413f40bb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "123b706664cf457747de356e86d02a157b3d4bf0cda4e8b12778bdd6842585e0", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCredit Derivatives\nThe firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives inlocations around the world to facilitate client transactionsand to manage the credit risk associated with market-making and investing and lending activities. Creditderivatives are actively managed based on the firm\u2019s net riskposition. Credit derivatives are generally individuallynegotiated contracts and can have various settlement andpayment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay,bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring,repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity.\nThe firm enters into the following types of credit\nderivatives:\n\u2030Credit Default Swaps. Single-name credit default swaps\nprotect the buyer against the loss of principal on one ormore bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) inthe event the issuer of the reference obligations suffers acredit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial orperiodic premium to the seller and receives protection forthe period of the contract. If there is no credit event, asdefined in the contract, the seller of protection makes nopayments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the sellerof protection is required to make a payment to the buyer,calculated according to the terms of the contract.\n\u2030Credit Options. In a credit option, the option writer\nassumes the obligation to purchase or sell a referenceobligation at a specified price or credit spread. The optionpurchaser buys the right, but does not assume theobligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchaseit from, the option writer. The payments on credit optionsdepend either on a particular credit spread or the price ofthe reference obligation.\n\u2030Credit Indices, Baskets and Tranches. Credit\nderivatives may reference a basket of single-name creditdefault swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit eventoccurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, theprotection seller pays the protection buyer. The paymentis typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction\u2019s totalnotional amount based on the underlying defaultedreference obligation. In certain transactions, the creditrisk of a basket or index is separated into various portions(tranches), each having different levels of subordination.The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and oncelosses exceed the notional amount of these juniortranches, any excess loss is covered by the next mostsenior tranche.\u2030Total Return Swaps. A total return swap transfers the\nrisks relating to economic performance of a referenceobligation from the protection buyer to the protectionseller. Typically, the protection buyer receives a floatingrate of interest and protection against any reduction infair value of the reference obligation, and the protectionseller receives the cash flows associated with the referenceobligation, plus any increase in the fair value of thereference obligation.\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit\nderivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchasedcredit derivatives with identical underliers. Substantially allof the firm\u2019s purchased credit derivative transactions arewith financial institutions and are subject to stringentcollateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of aspecified trigger event, the firm may take possession of thereference obligations underlying a particular written creditderivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of thereference obligations, recover amounts on the underlyingreference obligations in the event of default.\nAs of December 2018, written credit derivatives had a total\ngross notional amount of $554.17 billion and purchasedcredit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of$603.00 billion, for total net notional purchased protectionof $48.83 billion. As of December 2017, written creditderivatives had a total gross notional amount of$611.04 billion and purchased credit derivatives had a totalgross notional amount of $643.37 billion, for total netnotional purchased protection of $32.33 billion.Substantially all of the firm\u2019s written and purchased creditderivatives are credit default swaps.\n132 Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4240, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c4f679d-511f-4521-955d-11faa0042cde": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c4f679d-511f-4521-955d-11faa0042cde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "534ee8a2-b0e9-409f-9e1c-65d4dd0d6ee9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4cf313fd1598c1c9766c1a02fa70cf823b2fb8073e75fee155a7b50d56ff17ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "31b0e99a-fc01-45f1-bcbc-2c490ba6b4dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6bfae756ef43b8fde209a6da05cadcee15e6316232529a02f93515bda15fb49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fc27a006-a802-4d3b-99c6-454bd9e1bda1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e696dbd65a782b5767932b857c183c62805d989c2d9757d41de1d5ff37b9d312", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3fa2896f6956f17f790a7d1b7c7c317512275bcdc52949da01ee252d0cff3821", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nHedge Accounting\nThe firm applies hedge accounting for (i) certain interestrate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure ofcertain fixed-rate unsecured long-term and short-termborrowings and certain fixed-rate certificates of deposit and(ii) certain foreign currency forward contracts and foreigncurrency-denominated debt used to manage foreigncurrency exposures on the firm\u2019s net investment in certainnon-U.S. operations.\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument\nmust be highly effective at reducing the risk from theexposure being hedged. Additionally, the firm mustformally document the hedging relationship at inceptionand assess the hedging relationship at least on a quarterlybasis to ensure the hedging instrument continues to behighly effective over the life of the hedging relationship.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe firm designates certain interest rate swaps as fair valuehedges of certain fixed-rate unsecured long-term and short-term debt and fixed-rate certificates of deposit. Theseinterest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value attributableto the designated benchmark interest rate (e.g., LondonInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or Overnight Index SwapRate), effectively converting a substantial portion offixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations.\nThe firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression\nanalysis when assessing the effectiveness of its fair valuehedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in thefair values of the hedging instrument and the risk beinghedged (i.e., interest rate risk). An interest rate swap isconsidered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair valueattributable to changes in the hedged risk when theregression analysis results in a coefficient of determinationof 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%.\nFor qualifying fair value hedges, gains or losses on\nderivatives are included in interest expense. The change infair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk beinghedged is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value(hedging adjustment) and is also included in interestexpense.

The primaryreasons for electing the fair value option are to:\n\u2030Reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis;\n\u2030Mitigate volatility in earnings from using different\nmeasurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financialinstruments owned accounted for as financings arerecorded at fair value, whereas the related securedfinancing would be recorded on an accrual basis absentelecting the fair value option); and\n\u2030Address simplification and cost-benefit considerations\n(e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fairvalue in their entirety versus bifurcation of embeddedderivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts).\nHybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain\nbifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not requiresettlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g.,physical commodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate theembedded derivative from the associated debt, thederivative is accounted for at fair value and the hostcontract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for theeffective portion of any fair value hedges. If the firm doesnot elect to bifurcate, the entire hybrid financial instrumentis accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\nOther financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for\nat fair value under the fair value option include:\n\u2030Repurchase agreements and substantially all resale\nagreements;\n\u2030Securities borrowed and loaned in Fixed Income,\nCurrency and Commodities Client Execution (FICCClient Execution);\n\u2030Substantially all other secured financings, including\ntransfers of assets accounted for as financings;\n\u2030Certain unsecured short-term and long-term borrowings,\nsubstantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments;\n\u2030Certain customer and other receivables, including\ntransfers of assets accounted for as secured loans andcertain margin loans; and\n\u2030Certain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity\nare not eligible for a fair value option election), includingstructured certificates of deposit, which are hybridfinancial instruments.\nGoldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K 135", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4823, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e4e3c8f-a4c6-4339-8a94-7acdf9c5a73f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e4e3c8f-a4c6-4339-8a94-7acdf9c5a73f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "139", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ced82390-0b19-4cf9-a7aa-5af0c514b67a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "139", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f054a9220edc2442b0fd5c6f94110ab309a5270accce45a70ae429fc5a4fea47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4df537de-41b9-4d32-8484-7776e3153d00", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "GS2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2620947, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d4dd8e4bb37bc8bd7d961dcc9d35e2d843bbfc8c643060858304cc5ce96f4a6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "04280f65-a7ca-433e-a090-6a7be9c53c52", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62722d9aae8a831c7a01b367115c73e19365439c7265a121f88d59bfef1ced8d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "be06ec46120f5f2b41974c01005b603228f935c40048a67a5f844cdb7a43baee", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nWhen it is determined that the firm cannot reasonably\nestimate expected cash flows on PCI loans or pools ofloans, such loans are placed on nonaccrual status.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses consists of theallowance for losses on loans and lending commitments.\nThe firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses consists of specific\nloan-level reserves, portfolio level reserves and reserves onPCI loans, as described below:\n\u2030Specific loan-level reserves are determined on loans\n(excluding PCI loans) that exhibit credit quality weaknessand are therefore individually evaluated for impairment.\n\u2030Portfolio level reserves are determined on loans\n(excluding PCI loans) not evaluated for specific loan-levelreserves by aggregating groups of loans with similar riskcharacteristics and estimating the probable loss inherentin the portfolio.\n\u2030Reserves on PCI loans are recorded when it is determined\nthat the expected cash flows, which are reassessed on aquarterly basis, will be lower than those used to establishthe current effective yield for such loans or pools of loans.If the expected cash flows are determined to besignificantly higher than those used to establish thecurrent effective yield, such increases are initiallyrecognized as a reduction to any previously recordedallowances for loan losses and any remaining increasesare recognized as interest income prospectively over thelife of the loan or pools of loans as an increase to theeffective yield.\nThe allowance for loan losses is determined using various\nrisk factors, including industry default and loss data,current macroeconomic indicators, borrower\u2019s capacity tomeet its financial obligations, borrower\u2019s country of risk,loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loansbacked by real estate, risk factors include loan to valueratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factorsfor consumer loans include FICO credit scores anddelinquency status.\nManagement\u2019s estimate of loan losses entails judgment\nabout loan collectability at the reporting dates, and thereare uncertainties inherent in those judgments. Whilemanagement uses the best information available todetermine this estimate, future adjustments to theallowance may be necessary based on, among other things,changes in the economic environment or variances betweenactual results and the original assumptions used. Loans arecharged off against the allowance for loan losses whendeemed to be uncollectible.The firm also records an allowance for losses on lending\ncommitments that are held for investment and accountedfor on an accrual basis. Such allowance is determined usingthe same methodology as the allowance for loan losses,while also taking into consideration the probability ofdrawdowns or funding, and is included in other liabilities.\nThe table below presents gross loans receivable and lending\ncommitments by impairment methodology.\n$ in millions Specific Portfolio PCI Total\nAs of December 2018\nLoans

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 11.\nSecuritization Activities\nThe firm securitizes residential and commercial mortgages,\ncorporate bonds, loans and other types of financial assetsby selling these assets to securitization vehicles (e.g., trusts,corporate entities and limited liability companies) orthrough a resecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter ofthe beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm\u2019sresidential mortgage securitizations are primarily inconnection with government agency securitizations.\nBeneficial interests issued by securitization entities are debt\nor equity instruments that give the investors rights toreceive all or portions of specified cash inflows to asecuritization vehicle and include senior and subordinatedinterests in principal, interest and/or other cash inflows.The proceeds from the sale of beneficial interests are used topay the transferor for the financial assets sold to thesecuritization vehicle or to purchase securities which serveas collateral.\nThe firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has\nrelinquished control over the transferred financial assets.Prior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assetspending transfer at fair value and therefore does nottypically recognize significant gains or losses upon thetransfer of assets. Net revenues from underwriting activitiesare recognized in connection with the sales of theunderlying beneficial interests to investors.\nFor transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for\nas sales, the assets remain in financial instruments ownedand the transfer is accounted for as a collateralizedfinancing, with the related interest expense recognized overthe life of the transaction. See Note 10 for furtherinformation about collateralized financings and Note 23for further information about interest expense.\nThe firm generally receives cash in exchange for the\ntransferred assets but may also have continuinginvolvement with the transferred financial assets, includingownership of beneficial interests in securitized financialassets, primarily in the form of debt instruments. The firmmay also purchase senior or subordinated securities issuedby securitization vehicles (which are typically VIEs) inconnection with secondary market-making activities.The primary risks included in beneficial interests and other\ninterests from the firm\u2019s continuing involvement withsecuritization vehicles are the performance of theunderlying collateral, the position of the firm\u2019s investmentin the capital structure of the securitization vehicle and themarket yield for the security.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nVIE Consolidation Analysis\nThe enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIEis known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates theVIE.

The firmreassesses its determination of whether it is the primarybeneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on currentfacts and circumstances.\nVIE Activities\nThe firm is principally involved with VIEs through thefollowing business activities:\nMortgage-Backed VIEs. The firm sells residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assetssold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficialinterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connectionwith market-making activities. In addition, the firm mayenter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarilyinterest rate swaps, which are typically not variableinterests. The firm generally enters into derivatives withother counterparties to mitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit- and Power-Related and Other\nInvesting VIEs. The firm purchases equity and debt\nsecurities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold realestate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressedloans, power-related assets and equity securities. The firm\ngenerally does not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives\nwith, these VIEs.Corporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs. The\nfirm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchasesand sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt andother asset-backed VIEs in connection with market-makingactivities, and makes loans to VIEs that warehousecorporate debt. Certain of these VIEs synthetically createthe exposure for the beneficial interests they issue byentering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather thanpurchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm mayenter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, withcertain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, underwhich the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficialinterest holders and receives the return on the collateralowned by the VIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs isprimarily other asset-backed loans and securities. The firmgenerally can be removed as the total return swapcounterparty and enters into derivatives with othercounterparties to mitigate its risk related to these swaps.The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and otherasset-backed VIEs it structures.\nPrincipal-Protected Note VIEs. The firm structures VIEs\nthat issue principal-protected notes to clients. These VIEsown portfolios of assets, principally with exposure to hedgefunds. Substantially all of the principal protection on thenotes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset portfoliorebalancing that is required under the terms of the notes.The firm enters into total return swaps with these VIEsunder which the firm pays the VIE the return due to theprincipal-protected note holders and receives the return onthe assets owned by the VIE. The firm may enter intoderivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk.The firm also obtains funding through these VIEs.\nInvestments in Funds. The firm makes equity investments\nin certain investment fund VIEs it manages and is entitled toreceive fees from these VIEs.

Whenassessing goodwill for impairment, first, qualitative factorsare assessed to determine whether it is more likely than notthat the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less thanits estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitativeassessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill testis performed.The quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair\nvalue of each reporting unit with its estimated net bookvalue (including goodwill and identifiable intangibleassets). If the reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value exceedsits estimated net book value, goodwill is not impaired. Animpairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of areporting unit is less than its estimated net book value. Toestimate the fair value of each reporting unit, a relativevalue technique is used because the firm believes marketparticipants would use this technique to value the firm\u2019sreporting units. The relative value technique appliesobservable price-to-earnings multiples or price-to-bookmultiples and projected return on equity of comparablecompetitors to reporting units\u2019 net earnings or net bookvalue. The estimated net book value of each reporting unitreflects an allocation of total shareholders\u2019 equity andrepresents the estimated amount of total shareholders\u2019equity required to support the activities of the reportingunit under currently applicable regulatory capitalrequirements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the firm assessed goodwill for\nimpairment for each of its reporting units by performing aqualitative assessment. Multiple factors were assessed withrespect to each of the firm\u2019s reporting units to determinewhether it was more likely than not that the estimated fairvalue of any of these reporting units was less than itsestimated carrying value.

Since the prior quantitative\ngoodwill tests, fair value indicators in the marketimproved as global equity prices generally increased andcredit spreads generally tightened. For the firm and mostpublicly traded participants in its industry, stock pricesincreased since the prior tests. In addition, price-to-bookmultiples generally remained greater than 1.0x andprice-to-earnings multiples, while generally lower,remained relatively solid.\nAs a result of the qualitative assessment, the firm\ndetermined that it was more likely than not that theestimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceededits respective carrying value. Therefore, the firm determinedthat goodwill for each reporting unit was not impaired andthat a quantitative goodwill test was not required.\nSubsequent to the qualitative assessment, the firm\u2019s stock\nprice declined towards the end of the year.

See Note 13 for further information aboutthe sale and leaseback agreement.\nOperating leases include office space held in excess of\ncurrent requirements.

The firmrecords a liability, based on the fair value of the remaininglease rentals reduced by any potential or existing subleaserentals, for leases where the firm has ceased using the spaceand management has concluded that the firm will notderive any future economic benefits.

See Note 27 for information about\nlegal proceedings, including certain mortgage-relatedmatters, and agreements the firm has entered into to toll thestatute of limitations.\nCertain Mortgage-Related Contingencies. During the\nperiod 2005 through 2008 in connection with both salesand securitizations of loans, the firm provided loan-levelrepresentations and/or assigned the loan-levelrepresentations from the party from whom the firmpurchased the loans.The firm\u2019s exposure to claims for repurchase of residential\nmortgage loans based on alleged breaches ofrepresentations will depend on a number of factors such asthe extent to which these claims are made within the statuteof limitations, taking into consideration the agreements totoll the statute of limitations the firm entered into withtrustees representing certain trusts. Based upon the largenumber of defaults in residential mortgages, including thosesold or securitized by the firm, there is a potential forrepurchase claims. However, the firm is not in a position tomake a meaningful estimate of that exposure at this time.\nOther Contingencies. In connection with the sale of Metro\nInternational Trade Services (Metro), the firm agreed toprovide indemnities to the buyer, which primarily relate tofundamental representations and warranties, and potentialliabilities for legal or regulatory proceedings arising out ofthe conduct of Metro\u2019s business while the firm owned it.\nIn connection with the settlement agreement with the\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group ofthe U.S. Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, the firmagreed to provide $1.80 billion in consumer relief byJanuary 2021. As of December 2018, approximately$1.20 billion of such relief was provided.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the table above:\n\u2030The maximum payout is based on the notional amount of\nthe contract and does not represent anticipated losses.\n\u2030Amounts exclude certain commitments to issue standby\nletters of credit that are included in lending commitments.See the tables in \u201cCommitments\u201d above for a summary ofthe firm\u2019s commitments.\n\u2030The carrying value for derivatives included derivative\nassets of $1.48 billion as of December 2018 and$1.33 billion as of December 2017, and derivativeliabilities of $5.59 billion as of December 2018 and$5.17 billion as of December 2017.\nDerivative Guarantees. The firm enters into various\nderivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee underU.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity putoptions, written currency contracts and interest rate caps,floors and swaptions. These derivatives are risk managedtogether with derivatives that do not meet the definition ofa guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table abovedo not reflect the firm\u2019s overall risk related to derivativeactivities. Disclosures about derivatives are not required ifthey may be cash settled and the firm has no basis toconclude it is probable that the counterparties held theunderlying instruments at inception of the contract. Thefirm has concluded that these conditions have been met forcertain large, internationally active commercial andinvestment bank counterparties, central clearingcounterparties and certain other counterparties.Accordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in thetable above. In addition, during 2018, the firm concludedthat these conditions have also been met for hedge fundcounterparties and, therefore, has not included contractswith these counterparties in the table above. Prior periodshave been conformed to the current presentation. SeeNote 7 for information about credit derivatives that meetthe definition of a guarantee, which are not included in thetable above.\nDerivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the\ncarrying value is considered the best indication of payment/performance risk for individual contracts. However, thecarrying values in the table above exclude the effect ofcounterparty and cash collateral netting.Securities Lending Indemnifications. The firm, in its\ncapacity as an agency lender, indemnifies most of itssecurities lending customers against losses incurred in theevent that borrowers do not return securities and thecollateral held is insufficient to cover the market value ofthe securities borrowed. Collateral held by the lenders inconnection with securities lending indemnifications was$28.75 billion as of December 2018 and $39.03 billion asof December 2017. Because the contractual nature of thesearrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with amarket value that exceeds the value of the securities lent tothe borrower, there is minimal performance risk associatedwith these guarantees.\nOther Financial Guarantees. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm provides other financial guarantees of theobligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of creditand other guarantees to enable clients to completetransactions and fund-related guarantees). Theseguarantees represent obligations to make payments tobeneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill itsobligation under a contractual arrangement with thatbeneficiary.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The firm has\nestablished trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I, theAPEX Trusts and other entities for the limited purpose ofissuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds tothe firm and entering into contractual arrangements withthe firm and third parties related to this purpose. The firmdoes not consolidate these entities. See Note 16 for furtherinformation about the transactions involving GoldmanSachs Capital I and the APEX Trusts.\nThe firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional\nguarantee of the securities issued by these entities.

In certain cases, thefirm has the right to seek indemnification from these third-party service providers for certain relevant losses incurredby the firm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment,clearing and settlement networks, as well as securitiesexchanges around the world that may require the firm tomeet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in theevent of member defaults and other loss scenarios.\nIn connection with the firm\u2019s prime brokerage and clearing\nbusinesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle on behalf of itsclients the transactions entered into by them with otherbrokerage firms. The firm\u2019s obligations in respect of suchtransactions are secured by the assets in the client\u2019s account,as well as any proceeds received from the transactionscleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the client.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 20.\nRegulation and Capital Ade quacy\nThe FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a bank\nholding company (BHC) under the U.S. Bank HoldingCompany Act of 1956 and a financial holding companyunder amendments to this Act. As a BHC, the firm issubject to consolidated regulatory capital requirementswhich are calculated in accordance with the regulations ofthe FRB (Capital Framework).\nThe capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital\nand leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatorycapital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets andoff-balance-sheet exposures. Failure to comply with thesecapital requirements could result in restrictions beingimposed by the firm\u2019s regulators and could limit the firm\u2019sability to distribute capital, including share repurchases anddividend payments, and to make certain discretionarycompensation payments. The firm\u2019s capital levels are alsosubject to qualitative judgments by the regulators aboutcomponents of capital, risk weightings and other factors.Furthermore, certain of the firm\u2019s subsidiaries are subject toseparate regulations and capital requirements.\nCapital Framework\nThe regulations under the Capital Framework are largelybased on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s(Basel Committee) capital framework for strengtheninginternational capital standards (Basel III) and alsoimplement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.Under the Capital Framework, the firm is an \u201cAdvancedapproach\u201d banking organization and has been designatedas a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).\nThe Capital Framework includes risk-based capital buffers\nwhich began to phase in ratably on January 1, 2016, andbecame fully effective on January 1, 2019. The risk-basedcapital buffers include the capital conservation buffer,G-SIB buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, if any, all ofwhich must consist entirely of capital that qualifies asCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1). The G-SIB buffer is anextension of the capital conservation buffer, is updatedannually based on financial data from the prior year and isgenerally applicable for the following year. Thecountercyclical capital buffer is also an extension of thecapital conservation buffer and is intended to counteractsystemic vulnerabilities. The Capital Framework alsorequires deductions from regulatory capital that phased inratably per year from 2014 to 2018. In addition, juniorsubordinated debt issued to trusts will be fully phased outof regulatory capital by 2022.The firm calculates its CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total\ncapital ratios in accordance with (i) the Standardizedapproach and market risk rules set out in the CapitalFramework (together, the Standardized Capital Rules) and(ii) the Advanced approach and market risk rules set out inthe Capital Framework (together, the Basel III AdvancedRules). The lower of each risk-based capital ratio calculatedin (i) and (ii) is the ratio against which the firm\u2019s compliancewith its minimum risk-based ratio requirements is assessed.Under the Capital Framework, the firm is also subject toTier 1 leverage requirements established by the FRB. TheCapital Framework also introduced a supplementaryleverage ratio (SLR) which became effective onJanuary 1, 2018.\nConsolidated Regulatory Risk-Based Capital and\nLeverage RatiosThe table below

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRisk-Weighted Assets. RWAs are calculated in\naccordance with both the Standardized Capital Rules andthe Basel III Advanced Rules.\nCredit Risk\nCredit RWAs are calculated based upon measures ofexposure, which are then risk weighted under theStandardized Capital Rules and Basel III Advanced Rules:\n\u2030The Standardized Capital Rules apply prescribed risk-\nweights, which depend largely on the type ofcounterparty. The exposure measure for derivatives andsecurities financing transactions are based on specificformulas which take certain factors into consideration.\n\u2030Under the Basel III Advanced Rules, the firm computes\nrisk-weights for wholesale and retail credit exposures inaccordance with the Advanced Internal Ratings-Basedapproach. The exposure measures for derivatives andsecurities financing transactions are computed utilizinginternal models.\n\u2030For both Standardized and Basel III Advanced credit\nRWAs, the risk-weights for securitizations and equitiesare based on specific required formulaic approaches.\nMarket Risk\nRWAs for market risk in accordance with the StandardizedCapital Rules and the Basel III Advanced Rules aregenerally consistent. Market RWAs are calculated based onmeasures of exposure which include Value-at-Risk (VaR),stressed VaR, incremental risk and comprehensive riskbased on internal models, and a standardized measurementmethod for specific risk.\n\u2030VaR is the potential loss in value of inventory positions,\nas well as certain other financial assets and financialliabilities, due to adverse market movements over adefined time horizon with a specified confidence level.\nFor both risk management purposes and regulatory\ncapital calculations the firm uses a single VaR modelwhich captures risks including those related to interestrates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices.However, VaR used for regulatory capital requirements(regulatory VaR) differs from risk management VaR dueto different time horizons and confidence levels (10-dayand 99% for regulatory VaR vs. one-day and 95% forrisk management VaR), as well as differences in the scopeof positions on which VaR is calculated. In addition, thedaily net revenues used to determine risk managementVaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues tothe VaR measure calculated as of the end of the priorbusiness day) include intraday activity, whereas the FRB\u2019sregulatory capital rules require that intraday activity beexcluded from daily net revenues when calculatingregulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to bepositive by their nature.As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR\nexceptions and the amount of daily net revenuescalculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amountscalculated for risk management VaR.

Due to the integrated nature of thesesegments, estimates and judgments are made in allocatingcertain assets, revenues and expenses. The allocationprocess is based on the manner in which managementcurrently views the performance of the segments.Management believes that this allocation provides a\nreasonable representation of each segment\u2019s contribution toconsolidated pre-tax earnings and total assets.

The firm also provides certain benefits to formeror inactive employees prior to retirement.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and Postretirement\nPlansEmployees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries participate invarious defined benefit pension plans. These plans generallyprovide benefits based on years of credited service and apercentage of eligible compensation. The firm maintains adefined benefit pension plan for certain U.K. employees. Asof April 2008, the U.K. defined benefit plan was closed tonew participants and frozen for existing participants as ofMarch 31, 2016. The non-U.S. plans do not have a materialimpact on the firm\u2019s consolidated results of operations.\nThe firm also maintains a defined benefit pension plan for\nsubstantially all U.S. employees hired prior toNovember 1, 2003. As of November 2004, this plan wasclosed to new participants and frozen for existingparticipants. In addition, the firm maintains unfundedpostretirement benefit plans that provide medical and lifeinsurance for eligible retirees and their dependents coveredunder these programs. These plans do not have a materialimpact on the firm\u2019s consolidated results of operations.\nThe firm recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit\npension and postretirement plans, measured as thedifference between the fair value of the plan assets and thebenefit obligation, in the consolidated statements offinancial condition. As of December 2018, other assetsincluded $462 million (related to overfunded pensionplans) and other liabilities included $344 million, related tothese plans.

Share-based awards that do notrequire future service (i.e., vested awards, including awardsgranted to retirement-eligible employees) are expensedimmediately. Share-based awards that require future serviceare amortized over the relevant service period. EffectiveJanuary 2017, forfeitures are recorded when they occur.Prior to January 2017, expected forfeitures were estimatedand recorded over the vesting period. See Note 3 forinformation about the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09.\nCash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are charged to\nretained earnings. If RSUs that require future service areforfeited, the related dividend equivalents originally chargedto retained earnings are reclassified to compensation expensein the period in which forfeiture occurs.\nThe firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon\ndelivery of share-based awards. In certain cases, primarilyrelated to conflicted employment (as outlined in theapplicable award agreements), the firm may cash settle share-based compensation awards accounted for as equityinstruments. For these awards, whose terms allow for cashsettlement, additional paid-in capital is adjusted to the extentof the difference between the value of the award at the timeof cash settlement and the grant-date value of the award.\nStock Incentive Plan\nThe firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The GoldmanSachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2018)(2018 SIP), which provides for grants of RSUs, restrictedstock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options,nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, andother share-based awards, each of which may be subject toperformance conditions.
