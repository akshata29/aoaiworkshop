AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAs a leading financial institution, we acknowledge the\nimportance of Climate Transition for our business. InFebruary 2021, we launched our inaugural sustainabilitybond of $800 million, which is aligned with our sustainablefinance framework for future issuances and funds a rangeof on-balance sheet sustainable finance activity. In addition,we are working with various external groups to developmethods, metrics and frameworks for the financial sector,with an aim to support greater consistency, comparabilityand utility in approaches to measuring the financial sector\u2019scontribution to Climate Transition initiatives. We believewe can advance sustainability by partnering with our clientsacross our businesses, including by developing newsustainability-linked financing solutions, offering strategicadvice, or coinvesting alongside our clients in clean energycompanies. We have announced a target to deploy$750 billion in sustainable financing, investing andadvisory activity by the beginning of 2030. As ofDecember 2021, we achieved approximately 40% of thatgoal, with the majority dedicated to Climate Transition. Inaddition, we have announced our commitment to align ourfinancing activities with a net-zero-by-2050 pathway. Inthat context, we have set an initial set of targets for 2030focused on three sectors \u2014 power, oil and gas, and automanufacturing \u2014 where we believe we can have the mostsignificant impact and we see an opportunity to proactivelyengage our clients, investors, advocacy groups and multi-stakeholder organizations, deploy capital required fortransition, and invest in new commercial solutions to drivedecarbonization in the real economy. Carbon neutrality isalso a priority for the operation of our firm and our supplychain. In 2015, we achieved carbon neutrality in ouroperations and business travel, ahead of our 2020 goalannounced in 2009. We have expanded our operationalcarbon commitment to include our supply chain, targetingnet-zero carbon emissions by 2030.\nIn addition to Climate Transition, our approach to\nsustainability also centers on Inclusive Growth and advancingeconomic empowerment and financial opportunity for all. Wehave sponsored initiatives, such as One Million Black Women,\nLaunch With GS, our Urban Investment Group, 10,000Women and 10,000 Small Businesses . An overarching theme\nof our sustainability strategy is promoting diversity andinclusion as an imperative for us, as well as our clients andtheir boards. These efforts are further strengthened by strategicpartnerships that we have established in areas where we haveidentified gaps, or believe we are able to drive even greaterimpact through collaboration. We also believe our ability toachieve our sustainability objectives is critically dependent onthe strengths and talents of our people, and we recognize thatour people are able to maximize their impact by collaboratingin a diverse and inclusive work environment. See \u201cBusiness \u2014Human Capital Management\u201d for information about ourhuman capital management goals, programs and policies.Competition\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses areintensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so.Our competitors are other entities that provide investmentbanking (including transaction banking), market-making,investment management services, commercial and/orconsumer lending, deposit-taking and other bankingproducts and services, as well as those entities that makeinvestments in securities, commodities, derivatives, realestate, loans and other financial assets. These entitiesinclude brokers and dealers, investment banking firms,commercial banks, credit card issuers, insurancecompanies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds,private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer financecompanies and financial technology and other internet-based companies. We compete with some entities globallyand with others on a regional, product or niche basis. Wecompete based on a number of factors, includingtransaction execution, client experience, products andservices, innovation, reputation and price.\nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to\nretain market share by committing capital to businesses ortransactions on terms that offer returns that may not becommensurate with their risks. In particular, corporateclients seek such commitments (such as agreements toparticipate in their loan facilities) from financial servicesfirms in connection with investment banking and otherassignments.\nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased\nthe capital base and geographic reach of some of ourcompetitors, and have also hastened the globalization of thesecurities and other financial services markets. As a result,we have had to commit capital to support our internationaloperations and to execute large global transactions.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nA number of our businesses are subject to intense price\ncompetition. Efforts by our competitors to gain marketshare have resulted in pricing pressure in our investmentbanking, market-making, consumer, wealth managementand asset management businesses. For example, theincreasing volume of trades executed electronically,through the internet and through alternative tradingsystems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions,in that commissions for electronic trading are generallylower than those for non-electronic trading. It appears thatthis trend toward low-commission trading will continue.Price competition has also led to compression in thedifference between the price at which a market participantis willing to sell an instrument and the price at whichanother market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offerspread), which has affected our market-making businesses.The increasing prevalence of passive investment strategiesthat typically have lower fees than other strategies we offerhas affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for ourasset management products and services. In addition, webelieve that we will continue to experience competitivepressures in these and other areas in the future as some ofour competitors seek to obtain market share by furtherreducing prices, and as we enter into or expand ourpresence in markets that may rely more heavily onelectronic trading and execution. We and other banks alsocompete for deposits on the basis of the rates we offer.Increases in short-term interest rates are expected to resultin more intense competition in deposit pricing.\nWe also compete on the basis of the types of financial\nproducts and client experiences that we and ourcompetitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitorsmay offer financial products that we do not offer and thatour clients may prefer, or our competitors may developtechnology platforms that provide a better clientexperience.\nThe provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\nand Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), therequirements promulgated by the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financialregulations could affect our competitive position to theextent that limitations on activities, increased fees andcompliance costs or other regulatory requirements do notapply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors orare not implemented uniformly across differentjurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrictinvestments in certain hedge and private equity fundsdifferentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-basedbanking organizations and give non-U.S.-based bankingorganizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S.and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S.Likewise, the obligations with respect to derivative\ntransactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend,in part, on the location of the counterparties to thetransaction. The impact of regulatory developments on ourcompetitive position has depended and will continue todepend to a large extent on the manner in which therequired rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, theextent of international convergence, and the developmentof market practice and structures under the evolvingregulatory regimes, as described further in \u201cRegulation\u201dbelow.\nWe also face intense competition in attracting and retaining\nqualified employees. Our ability to continue to competeeffectively has depended and will continue to depend uponour ability to attract new employees, retain and motivateour existing employees and to continue to compensateemployees competitively amid intense public and regulatoryscrutiny on the compensation practices of large financialinstitutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of ourcompetitors are subject to review by, and the standards of,the FRB and other regulators inside and outside the U.S.,including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) andthe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We alsocompete for employees with institutions whose paypractices are not subject to regulatory oversight.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur principal subsidiaries in the U.K. include GSI, a U.K.\nbroker-dealer and a designated investment firm, and GSIB,a U.K. bank. Both GSI and GSIB are regulated by the PRAand the FCA. As an investment firm, GSI is subject toprudential requirements applicable to banks, includingcapital and liquidity requirements. GSI provides broker-dealer services in and from the U.K. and is registered withthe CFTC as a swap dealer and with the SEC as a securities-based swap dealer. GSIB engages in lending (includingsecurities lending) and deposit-taking activities and is aprimary dealer for U.K. government bonds. GSI and GSIBmaintain branches outside of the U.K. and are subject to thelaws and regulations of the jurisdictions where they arelocated.\nCapital and Liquidity Requirements. We and GS Bank\nUSA are subject to regulatory risk-based capital andleverage requirements that are calculated in accordancewith the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). TheCapital Framework is largely based on the BaselCommittee\u2019s framework for strengthening the regulation,supervision and risk management of banks (Basel III) andalso implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.Under the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies\u2019 tailoringframework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to \u201cCategoryI\u201d standards because we have been designated as a globalsystemically important bank (G-SIB). Accordingly, we andGS Bank USA are \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d bankingorganizations. Under the Capital Framework, we and GSBank USA must meet specific regulatory capitalrequirements that involve quantitative measures of assets,liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. Thesufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitativejudgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are alsosubject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S.federal bank regulatory agencies.\nGSBE is subject to capital and liquidity requirements\nprescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation, asamended (CRR), and the E.U. Capital RequirementsDirective, as amended (CRD), which are largely based onBasel III.\nThe most recent previous amendments to the CRR and\nCRD (respectively, CRR II and CRD V) include changes tothe market risk, counterparty credit risk, large exposuresand leverage ratio frameworks. These changes have beenapplicable in the E.U. since June 2021.\nGSI and GSIB are subject to the U.K. capital and liquidity\nframeworks, which are also largely based on Basel III andremain predominantly aligned with the E.U. capital andliquidity frameworks. Amendments similar to CRR II andCRD V became applicable in the U.K. on January 1, 2022.Requirements established by E.U. and U.K. authorities aretherefore similar to those applicable to GS Bank USA andus.Risk-Based Capital Ratios. As Advanced approach\nbanking organizations, we and GS Bank USA calculate risk-based capital ratios in accordance with both theStandardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Both theAdvanced Capital Rules and the Standardized CapitalRules include minimum risk-based capital requirementsand additional capital conservation buffer requirementsthat must be satisfied solely with Common Equity Tier 1(CET1) capital. Failure to satisfy a buffer requirement infull would result in constraints on capital distributions anddiscretionary executive compensation. The severity of theconstraints would depend on the amount of the shortfalland the organization\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d definedas the greater of (i) net income for the four precedingquarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects notreflected in net income; and (ii) the average of net incomeover the preceding four quarters. For Group Inc., thecapital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5%buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capitalbuffer (SCB) (under the Standardized Capital Rules), andboth a countercyclical buffer and the G-SIB surcharge(under both Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA, the capitalconservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% bufferand the countercyclical capital buffer.\nThe SCB is based on the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nsupervisory stress tests and our planned common stockdividends and is likely to change over time based on theresults of the annual supervisory stress tests.

Depending onhow these guidelines are implemented by nationalregulators, they may apply, among others, to certainsubsidiaries of G-SIBs. These guidelines are in addition tothe framework for G-SIBs, but are more principles-based.The CRD and CRR provide that institutions that aresystemically important at the E.U. or member state level,known as other systemically important institutions(O-SIIs), may be subject to additional capital ratiorequirements, according to their degree of systemicimportance (O-SII buffers). In 2021, BaFin identified GSBEas an O-SII in Germany and set an O-SII buffer, applicablefrom January 1, 2022.\nIn the U.K., the PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group\nUK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI andGSIB, as an O-SII but has not applied an O-SII buffer.\nThe Basel Committee has finalized revisions to the\nframework for calculating capital requirements for marketrisk as part of its Fundamental Review of the Trading Book(FRTB). These revisions are expected to increase marketrisk capital requirements for most banking organizationsand large broker-dealers subject to bank capitalrequirements. The revised framework, among other things,revises the standardized and internal model-basedapproaches used to calculate market risk requirements andclarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capitalrequirements. The Basel Committee frameworkcontemplates that national regulators implement therevised framework by January 1, 2023. The U.S. federalbank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rulesimplementing the revised framework. Under the CRR, E.U.financial institutions commenced reporting their marketrisk calculations under the revised framework in the thirdquarter of 2021. U.K. authorities have not yet proposedrules to implement this framework.The Basel Committee published standards that it described\nas the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatoryreforms (Basel III Revisions). These standards set a floor oninternally modeled capital requirements at a percentage ofthe capital requirements under the standardized approach.They also revise the Basel Committee\u2019s standardized andinternal model-based approaches for credit risk, provide anew standardized approach for operational risk capital andrevise the frameworks for credit valuation adjustment(CVA) risk. The Basel Committee framework contemplatesthat national regulators implement these standards byJanuary 1, 2023, and that the new floor be phased inthrough January 1, 2028. In July 2020, the BaselCommittee finalized further revisions to the framework forCVA risk, which are intended to align that framework withthe market risk framework.\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities have not yet\nproposed rules implementing the Basel III Revisions forpurposes of their risk-based capital ratios. The EuropeanCommission proposed rules to implement the Basel IIIRevisions in October 2021. The proposed E.U. rulescontemplate amendments to the CRR and the CRD,referred to as CRR III and CRD VI, to take effect inJanuary 2025. The U.K. authorities have not yet released aproposal on the Basel III Revisions.\nThe Basel Committee has also published an updated\nsecuritization framework and a revised G-SIB assessmentmethodology, but the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencieshave not yet proposed rules implementing them.

TheBasel Committee\u2019s NSFR framework requires bankingorganizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%.The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final\nrule, which became effective in July 2021, implementing theNSFR for large U.S. banking organizations, including usand GS Bank USA.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD),\nas amended by the BRRD II, establishes a framework forthe recovery and resolution of financial institutions in theE.U., such as GSBE. The BRRD provides nationalsupervisory authorities with tools and powers topre-emptively address potential financial crises in order topromote financial stability and minimize taxpayers\u2019exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U. member statesto grant certain resolution powers to national and, whererelevant, E.U. resolution authorities, including the power toimpose a temporary stay and to recapitalize a failing entityby writing down its unsecured debt or converting itsunsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in theE.U. must provide that contracts governed by non-E.U. lawrecognize those temporary stay and bail-in powers unlessdoing so would be impracticable. GSBE is under the directauthority of the Single Resolution Board for resolutionplanning. Regulatory authorities in the E.U. may requirefinancial institutions in the E.U., including subsidiaries ofnon-E.U. groups, to submit recovery plans and to assist therelevant resolution authority in constructing resolutionplans for the E.U. entities. GSBE\u2019s primary regulator withrespect to recovery planning is the ECB, and it is alsoregulated by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank.\nThe U.K. Special Resolution Regime confers substantially\nthe same powers on the Bank of England, as the U.K.resolution authority, and substantially the samerequirements on U.K. financial institutions. Further, certainU.K. financial institutions, including GSI and GSIB, arerequired to meet the Bank of England\u2019s expectationscontained in the U.K. Resolution Assessment Framework,including with respect to loss absorbency, contractual stays,operational continuity and funding in resolution. They arealso required by the PRA to submit solvent wind-downplans on how they could be wound down in a stressedenvironment. The PRA is also the regulatory authority inthe U.K. that supervises recovery planning, and GSI andGSIB are each required to submit recovery plans to thePRA.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). The FRB has\nissued a rule addressing U.S. implementation of theFinancial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB\u2019s) TLAC principles andterm sheet on minimum TLAC requirements for G-SIBs.The rule (i) establishes minimum TLAC requirements;(ii) establishes minimum requirements for \u201celigible long-term debt\u201d (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity of atleast one year from issuance and satisfies certain additionalcriteria); (iii) prohibits certain parent companytransactions; and (iv) caps the amount of parent companyliabilities that are not eligible long-term debt.The rule also prohibits a BHC that has been designated as a\nU.S. G-SIB from (i) guaranteeing subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities thatare subject to early termination provisions if the BHCenters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subjectto an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S.federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on QFCs;(ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries;(iii) issuing short-term debt to third parties; or (iv) enteringinto derivatives and certain other financial contracts withexternal counterparties.\nAdditionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the value of the parent\ncompany\u2019s eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecurednon-contingent third-party liabilities that are not eligiblelong-term debt that could rank equally with or junior toeligible long-term debt.\nThe FRB, the OCC and the FDIC issued a final rule,\neffective April 1, 2021, requiring \u201cAdvanced approach\u201dbanking organizations, such as us, to deduct from their ownregulatory capital certain investments above thresholds inunsecured debt instruments issued by G-SIBs, includingthose issued for purposes of satisfying TLAC requirements.\nThe CRR and the BRRD are designed to, among other\nthings, implement the FSB\u2019s minimum TLAC requirementfor G-SIBs. For example, the CRR requires E.U.subsidiaries of a non-E.U. G-SIB to meet internal TLACrequirements if they exceed the threshold of 5% of theG-SIB\u2019s RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure.GSBE does not currently exceed these thresholds.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe BRRD II and the U.K. resolution regime subject\ninstitutions to an MREL, which is generally consistent withthe FSB\u2019s TLAC standard. In June 2018, the Bank ofEngland published a statement of policy on internal MREL,which requires a material U.K. subsidiary of an overseasbanking group, such as GSI, to meet a minimum internalMREL requirement to facilitate the transfer of losses to itsresolution entity, which for GSI is Group Inc. Thetransitional minimum internal MREL requirement becamefully effective on January 1, 2022. In order to comply withthe MREL statement of policy, we have provided the Bankof England the right to exercise bail-in triggers over certainintercompany regulatory capital and senior debtinstruments issued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bankof England to write down such instruments or convert suchinstruments to equity. The triggers can be exercised by theBank of England if it determines that GSI has reached thepoint of non-viability and the FRB and the FDIC have notobjected to the bail-in or if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy orsimilar proceedings.\nInsolvency of a BHC or IDI. The Dodd-Frank Act created\na resolution regime, OLA, for BHCs and their affiliates thatare systemically important. Under OLA, the FDIC may beappointed as receiver for the systemically importantinstitution and its failed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon therecommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S.Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things,that the institution is in default or in danger of default, thatthe institution\u2019s failure would have serious adverse effectson the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLAwould avoid or mitigate those effects.\nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the\npowers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations ofcreditors and other parties who have dealt with theinstitution, would be determined under OLA, and notunder the bankruptcy or insolvency law that wouldotherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under OLA aregenerally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver fordepository institutions under the FDIA, described below.Substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist\nbetween OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including theright of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priorityof creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of anadministrative claims procedure to determine creditors\u2019claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized inbankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC totransfer claims to a \u201cbridge\u201d entity. In addition, OLA limitsthe ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership.The FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve afailed FHC by transferring its assets to a \u201cbridge\u201d holdingcompany under its \u201csingle point of entry\u201d or \u201cSPOE\u201dstrategy pursuant to OLA.\nUnder the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or\nreceiver for an IDI such as GS Bank USA, upon itsinsolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broadpowers, including the power:\n\u2030To transfer any of the IDI\u2019s assets and liabilities to a new\nobligor, including a newly formed \u201cbridge\u201d bank,without the approval of the depository institution\u2019screditors;\n\u2030To enforce the IDI\u2019s contracts pursuant to their terms\nwithout regard to any provisions triggered by theappointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or\n\u2030To repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which\nthe IDI is a party, the performance of which is determinedby the FDIC to be burdensome and the repudiation ordisaffirmance of which is determined by the FDIC topromote the orderly administration of the IDI.\nIn addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit\nliabilities and certain claims for administrative expensesagainst an IDI would be afforded a priority over othergeneral unsecured claims, including deposits at non-U.S.branches and claims of debtholders of the IDI, in the\u201cliquidation or other resolution\u201d of such an institution byany receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC eversought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA,the debtholders (other than depositors at U.S. branches)would be treated differently from, and could receive, ifanything, substantially less than, the depositors at U.S.branches of GS Bank USA.\n18 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4397, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f69a1bfe-6d82-4fa4-beb7-b1afa019ad88": {"__data__": {"id_": "f69a1bfe-6d82-4fa4-beb7-b1afa019ad88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b43c4cb-cac1-4a91-bfe6-5dbaf12f9445", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d879ec209501e2944d674039d69298d7cb4a0380c11a209fd3d8d6f3e4074232", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0bc09132-77ba-4ba3-996a-99bb96c6bad1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f8fcce75ac52338616485b010b66d671ea5e4a9b1d85945de6dccd0f562925dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b6b62be7-313c-4138-866b-7f03f48808cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bdc091d40eb07f812ee6d04de29cacb3cec7f9d2f3512bd1885bb3400532c07a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d8b4aeb6c09bae3cc7d4856e9ed1c729954d7ea07f8dae2fa78dd16b50073ade", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The U.S. Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA)requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take\u201cprompt corrective action\u201d in respect of depositoryinstitutions that do not meet specified capital requirements.FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insuredbanks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequatelycapitalized, undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized\nand critically undercapitalized.\nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a\ncapital category that is lower than is indicated by its capitalratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsoundcondition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examinationrating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposesprogressively more restrictive constraints on operations,management and capital distributions, as the capitalcategory of an institution declines. Failure to meet thecapital requirements could also require a depositoryinstitution to raise capital. Ultimately, criticallyundercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointmentof a receiver or conservator, as described in \u201cInsolvency ofan IDI or a BHC\u201d above.\nThe prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to\nBHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriateaction at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalizedstatus of the BHC\u2019s depository institution subsidiaries. Incertain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depositoryinstitution subsidiary, the BHC would be required toguarantee the performance of the undercapitalizedsubsidiary\u2019s capital restoration plan and might be liable forcivil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitmentson that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of thebankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priorityover the BHC\u2019s general unsecured creditors, as described in\u201cSource of Strength\u201d above.Volcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities.

It also limits certain types oftransactions between us and our sponsored and advisedfunds, similar to the limitations on transactions betweendepository institutions and their affiliates. Covered fundsinclude our private equity funds, certain of our credit andreal estate funds, our hedge funds and certain otherinvestment structures. The limitation on investments incovered funds requires us to limit our investment in eachsuch fund to 3% or less of the fund\u2019s net asset value, and tolimit our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% orless of our Tier 1 capital.\nThe FRB has extended the conformance period to July 2022\nfor our investments in, and relationships with, certainlegacy \u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as defined in the Volcker Rule) thatwere in place prior to December 2013.

Security-based swaps are defined asswaps on single securities, single loans or narrow-basedbaskets or indices of securities.

In thefourth quarter of 2021, certain of our subsidiaries,including GS&Co., registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers and became subject to the SEC\u2019sregulations regarding security-based swaps. The SEC hasrecently proposed additional regulations regarding security-based swaps that would, among other things, require publicreporting of large positions in security-based swaps.The CFTC and the SEC have adopted rules relating to\ncross-border regulation of swaps, securities-based swaps,business conduct and registration requirements.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators,\nincluding the FRB and SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entitieshaving at least $1 billion in total assets. The U.S. financialregulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have notbeen finalized.\nThe NYDFS\u2019 guidance emphasizes that any incentive\ncompensation arrangements tied to employee performanceindicators at banking institutions regulated by the NYDFS,including GS Bank USA, must be subject to effective riskmanagement, oversight and control.\nIn the E.U., certain provisions in the CRR and CRD are\ndesigned to meet the FSB\u2019s compensation standards. Theseprovisions limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensationof all employees at GSBE and of certain employees at ourother operating subsidiaries in the E.U., including thoseemployees identified as having a material impact on the riskprofile of regulated entities. CRR II and CRD V amendedcertain aspects of these rules, including, by increasingminimum variable compensation deferral periods.Substantially similar requirements apply in the U.K. inrelation to GSI and GSIB.\nThe E.U. has also introduced rules regulating compensation\nfor certain persons providing services to certain investmentfunds.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and\nRegulationsThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as amended (BSA), including bythe USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, contains anti-moneylaundering and financial transparency laws and authorizesor mandates the promulgation of various regulationsapplicable to financial institutions, including standards forverifying client identification at account opening, andobligations to monitor client transactions and reportsuspicious activities. Through these and other provisions,the BSA seeks, among other things, to promote theidentification of parties that may be involved in terrorism,money laundering or other suspicious activities.The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which\namends the BSA, was enacted in January 2021. The AMLAis intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S.anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, theAMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-moneylaundering compliance for financial institutions; requiresthe U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgatepriorities for anti-money laundering and countering thefinancing of terrorism policy; requires the development ofstandards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury fortesting technology and internal processes for BSAcompliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in theavailable sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expandsBSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of thestatutory provisions in the AMLA will require additionalrulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact ofthe AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemakingand implementation guidance. In June 2021, the FinancialCrimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of theU.S. Department of Treasury, issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing ofterrorism policy, as required under the AMLA. Thepriorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terroristfinancing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking,human trafficking and proliferation financing.\nWe are subject to other laws and regulations worldwide\nrelating to anti-money laundering and financialtransparency, including the E.U. Anti-Money LaunderingDirectives. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. ForeignCorrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act andother laws and regulations worldwide regarding corruptand illegal payments, or providing anything of value, forthe benefit of government officials and others. The scope ofthe types of payments or other benefits covered by theselaws is very broad. These laws and regulations includerequirements relating to the identification of clients,monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions,monitoring direct and indirect payments to politicallyexposed persons, providing information to regulatoryauthorities and law enforcement agencies, and sharinginformation with other financial institutions.\n24 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4262, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e2d8b14-0160-46e1-ac75-feffbe1bf27c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e2d8b14-0160-46e1-ac75-feffbe1bf27c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0506ca11-d4d7-4848-a20f-5355e000ee06", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "238bb901f3b411c0276ec1600e7afd4e73c86823c7fbace63fff74f361ca1da8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f1279f4-3b7e-4055-b500-6fc6db7c70ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5535b142e9eac5c71f29046c3f97e8f7c20a2819057f6c4999442e810b4f39fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "81dbf240-8ff3-42eb-bf2b-33ec0a7dbba7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6eb3cc9e97a3d701c9db8b45e484066874dc7c5dc27e3db8dcfb4d829dd14d61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1cab5be850f19dcd2c89d6e23d5dc057094dd090770d331e57beb2eb06035c42", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe financial services industry and the securities and other\nfinancial markets have been materially and adverselyaffected in the past by significant declines in the values ofnearly all asset classes, by a serious lack of liquidity and byhigh levels of borrower defaults. In addition, concernsabout the COVID-19 pandemic, European sovereign debtrisk and its impact on the European banking system,limitations on international trade, and potential or actualchanges in interest rates, inflation and other marketconditions, have, at times, negatively impacted the levels ofclient activity.\nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market\nactivities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatoryreform, as well as weak consumer, investor and CEOconfidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty,has in the past negatively impacted client activity, whichcan adversely affect many of our businesses. Periods of lowvolatility and periods of high volatility combined with alack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable impacton our market-making businesses.\nFinancial institution returns may be negatively impacted by\nincreased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceivedgovernment support of such institutions in the event offuture financial crises relative to financial institutions incountries in which governmental support is maintained. Inaddition, liquidity in the financial markets has also beennegatively impacted as market participants and marketpractices and structures continue to adjust to evolvingregulatory frameworks.Our businesses have been and may in the future be\nadversely affected by declining asset values,particularly where we have net \u201clong\u201d positions,receive fees based on the value of assets managed, orreceive or post collateral.\nMany of our businesses have net \u201clong\u201d positions in debt\nsecurities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities (includingprivate equity and real estate) and most other asset classes.These include positions we take when we act as a principalto facilitate our clients\u2019 activities, including our exchange-based market-making activities, or commit large amountsof capital to maintain positions in interest rate and creditproducts, as well as through our currencies, commodities,equities and mortgage-related activities. In addition, weinvest in similar asset classes. Substantially all of ourinvesting and market-making positions and a portion of ourloans are marked-to-market on a daily or other periodicbasis and declines in asset values directly and promptlyimpact our earnings, unless we have effectively \u201chedged\u201dour exposures to those declines.\nIn certain circumstances (particularly in the case of credit\nproducts, including leveraged loans, and private equities orother securities that are not freely tradable or lackestablished and liquid trading markets), it may not bepossible or economic to hedge our exposures and to theextent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or maygreatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in thevalues of the assets. Sudden declines and significantvolatility in the prices of assets have in the past and may inthe future substantially curtail or eliminate the tradingmarkets for certain assets, which may make it difficult tosell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell oreffectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses insuch positions and the difficulty in valuing assets maynegatively affect our capital, liquidity or leverage ratios,increase our funding costs and generally require us tomaintain additional capital.\nIn our exchange-based market-making activities, we are\nobligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderlymarket, including by purchasing securities in a decliningmarket. In markets where asset values are declining and involatile markets, this results in losses and an increased needfor liquidity.\nWe receive asset-based management fees based on the value\nof our clients\u2019 portfolios or investment in funds managed byus and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees basedon increases in the value of such investments. Declines inasset values would ordinarily reduce the value of ourclients\u2019 portfolios or fund assets, which in turn wouldtypically reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 31", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4350, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d306d7cd-302f-4f7e-bb03-79de51a967b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "d306d7cd-302f-4f7e-bb03-79de51a967b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ed5e5f1-dad1-48ab-b9f3-1d17248690f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a2e578abff2c4abaf9a7dcdfde2e57c9a9f0856e64e22d694a78cf768c51173c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9de3ebd8-3fc8-451c-b6de-49d288da41c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e58c94d8569ee865914677b6c82d7ec69631cce61f12a3e0be1ca992c4d03a64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c22fdf5-5e10-47d8-beaa-698786de8b2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d86d8deb0db380e9f99e52dbd1542b28bece2977cd50a3eb03bf75d5675b606f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b51ed02d49d846c69ef64869a9ce8ee67422a905a18d68435c631c79bb22dc00", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe post collateral to support our obligations and receive\ncollateral that supports the obligations of our clients andcounterparties. When the value of the assets posted ascollateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateraldecline, the party posting the collateral may need to provideadditional collateral or, if possible, reduce its tradingposition. An example of such a situation is a \u201cmargin call\u201d inconnection with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines inthe value of asset classes used as collateral mean that eitherthe cost of funding positions is increased or the size ofpositions is decreased. If we are the party providingcollateral, this can increase our costs and reduce ourprofitability and if we are the party receiving collateral, thiscan also reduce our profitability by reducing the level ofbusiness done with our clients and counterparties.\nIn addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the\ndifficulty of valuing assets, which can lead to costly and time-consuming disputes over asset values and the level ofrequired collateral, as well as increased credit risk to therecipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequatecollateral. In cases where we foreclose on collateral, suddendeclines in the value or liquidity of the collateral has in thepast and may in the future, despite credit monitoring, over-collateralization, the ability to call for additional collateral orthe ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation,result in significant losses to us, especially where there is asingle type of collateral supporting the obligation. Inaddition, we have been and may in the future be subject toclaims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the legaldocuments, was conducted in an improper manner or causeda client or counterparty to go out of business.\nOur market-making activities have been and may in\nthe future be affected by changes in the levels ofmarket volatility.\nCertain of our market-making activities depend on market\nvolatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities toour clients, and decreases in volatility have reduced andmay in the future reduce these opportunities and the level ofclient activity associated with them and adversely affect theresults of these activities. Increased volatility, while it canincrease trading volumes and spreads, also increases risk asmeasured by Value-at-Risk (VaR) and may expose us toincreased risks in connection with our market-makingactivities or cause us to reduce our inventory in order toavoid increasing our VaR. Limiting the size of our market-making positions can adversely affect our profitability. Inperiods when volatility is increasing, but asset values aredeclining significantly, it may not be possible to sell assets atall or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts. Inthose circumstances we may be forced to either take onadditional risk or to realize losses in order to decrease ourVaR. In addition, increases in volatility increase the level ofour RWAs, which increases our capital requirements.Our investment banking, client intermediation, asset\nmanagement and wealth management businesseshave been adversely affected and may in the future beadversely affected by market uncertainty or lack ofconfidence among investors and CEOs due todeclines in economic activity and other unfavorableeconomic, geopolitical or market conditions.\nOur investment banking business has been and may in the\nfuture be adversely affected by market conditions. Pooreconomic conditions and other uncertain geopoliticalconditions may adversely affect and have in the pastadversely affected investor and CEO confidence, resultingin significant industry-wide declines in the size and numberof underwritings and of financial advisory transactions,which would likely have an adverse effect on our revenuesand our profit margins. In particular, because a significantportion of our investment banking revenues is derived fromour participation in large transactions, a decline in thenumber of large transactions has in the past and would inthe future adversely affect our investment banking business.Similarly, in recent years, cross-border initial publicofferings and other securities offerings have accounted for asignificant proportion of new issuance activity. Legislative,regulatory or other changes that limit trading in, or theissuance of, securities outside the issuers\u2019 domestic marketshave in the past and would in the future adversely affect ourunderwriting business.\nIn certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general\ndeclines in market or economic activity may adverselyaffect our client intermediation businesses by decreasinglevels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility, but atother times market uncertainty and even decliningeconomic activity may result in higher trading volumes orhigher spreads or both.\nMarket uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic\nconditions, as well as declines in asset values, may cause ourclients to transfer their assets out of our funds or otherproducts or their brokerage accounts and result in reducednet revenues, principally in our asset management andwealth management businesses. Even if clients do notwithdraw their funds, they may invest them in productsthat generate less fee income.\n32 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5365, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c22fdf5-5e10-47d8-beaa-698786de8b2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c22fdf5-5e10-47d8-beaa-698786de8b2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abd0716f-d202-4fa0-bbd5-470d8381fe88", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "7ba416180c502a0e0b00be1ac97f2cbd660180f98bd221aaa729f8911fe7b679", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d306d7cd-302f-4f7e-bb03-79de51a967b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b51ed02d49d846c69ef64869a9ce8ee67422a905a18d68435c631c79bb22dc00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2262333e-3f90-48af-92f2-546199bb5ecd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "abb822ac6afc7c48f874db496feda414adfdb9a11d2ced113174a638d5eed0a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d86d8deb0db380e9f99e52dbd1542b28bece2977cd50a3eb03bf75d5675b606f", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

This couldaffect the management and incentive fees that we earn onAUS or the commissions and net spreads that we earn forselling other investment products, such as structured notesor derivatives. To the extent that our clients choose toinvest in products that we do not currently offer, we willsuffer outflows and a loss of management fees. Further, if,due to changes in investor sentiment or the relativeperformance of certain asset classes or otherwise, clientscontinue to invest in products that generate lower fees (e.g.,passively managed or fixed income products), our averageeffective management fee would continue to decline andour asset management and wealth management businessescould be adversely affected.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity, profitability and businesses may beadversely affected by an inability to access the debtcapital markets or to sell assets.\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. It is of critical\nimportance to us, as most of the failures of financialinstitutions have occurred in large part due to insufficientliquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability toaccess secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inabilityto raise or retain deposits, an inability to access funds fromour subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally,an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments, lack oftimely settlement of transactions, unusual deposit outflows,or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, such asin March 2020, when corporate clients drew on revolvingcredit facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.This situation may arise due to circumstances that we maybe unable to control, such as a general market or economicdisruption or an operational problem that affects thirdparties or us, or even by the perception among marketparticipants that we, or other market participants, areexperiencing greater liquidity risk.We employ structured products to benefit our clients and\nhedge our own risks. The financial instruments that wehold and the contracts to which we are a party are oftencomplex, and these complex structured products often donot have readily available markets to access in times ofliquidity stress. Our investing and financing activities maylead to situations where the holdings from these activitiesrepresent a significant portion of specific markets, whichcould restrict liquidity for our positions.\nFurther, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is\nnot generally a liquid market for such assets, as well as incircumstances where other market participants are seekingto sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the sametime, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisisor in response to changes to rules or regulations. Forexample, recently an investment management firm withlarge positions with several financial institutions defaulted,resulting in rapidly declining prices in the securitiesunderlying those positions. In addition, clearinghouses,exchanges and other financial institutions with which weinteract may exercise set-off rights or the right to requireadditional collateral, including in difficult marketconditions, which could further impair our liquidity.\nRegulatory changes relating to liquidity may also negatively\nimpact our results of operations and competitive position.Numerous regulations have been adopted to introducemore stringent liquidity requirements for large financialinstitutions. These regulations address, among othermatters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidityrequirements, wholesale funding, limitations on theissuance of short-term debt and structured notes,deductions for holdings of TLAC and prohibitions onparent guarantees that are subject to certain cross-defaults.New and prospective liquidity-related regulations mayoverlap with, and be impacted by, other regulatorychanges, including rules relating to minimum long-termdebt requirements and TLAC, guidance on the treatment ofbrokered deposits and the capital, leverage and resolutionand recovery frameworks applicable to large financialinstitutions.

We fund ourselves on an unsecuredbasis by issuing long-term debt and commercial paper, byraising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybridfinancial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines ofcredit from commercial or other banking entities. We seekto finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Anydisruptions in the credit markets may make it harder andmore expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If ouravailable funding is limited or we are forced to fund ouroperations at a higher cost, these conditions may require usto curtail our business activities and increase our cost offunding, both of which could reduce our profitability,particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lendingand market making.\nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other\ntypes of strategic transactions often rely on access to thesecured and unsecured credit markets to finance theirtransactions. A lack of available credit or an increased costof credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing ofour clients\u2019 merger and acquisition transactions,particularly large transactions, and adversely affect ourfinancial advisory and underwriting businesses.\nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be\nnegatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. Alack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases pricevolatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all ofwhich can increase transaction risk or decrease theprofitability of these businesses.Reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our\ncredit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity andcost of funding.\nOur credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A\nreduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect ourliquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowingcosts, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger ourobligations under certain provisions in some of our tradingand collateralized financing contracts. Under theseprovisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminatecontracts with us or require us to post additional collateral.Termination of our trading and collateralized financingcontracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair ourliquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financingor to make significant cash payments or securitiesmovements.\nAs of December 2021, our counterparties could have called\nfor additional collateral or termination payments related toour net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in anaggregate amount of $345 million in the event of aone-notch downgrade of our credit ratings and$1.54 billion in the event of a two-notch downgrade of ourcredit ratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency,depending on the agency\u2019s relative ratings of us at the timeof the downgrade, may have an impact which iscomparable to the impact of a downgrade by all ratingagencies.

Increases in our credit spreads can significantlyincrease our cost of this funding.

In addition, protectivemeasures that we employ to compartmentalize our data mayreduce our visibility into, and adversely affect our ability torespond to, cyber threats and issues with our systems.\n40 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 4606, "end_char_idx": 5536, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16908967-996e-4428-b2c7-7634dd4c1851": {"__data__": {"id_": "16908967-996e-4428-b2c7-7634dd4c1851", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6ba177b-dbd8-4ba8-af23-31aea98c56da", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "625f4b76c467bdaeb08d00a1b5936af40dcd7bad3a0ece4b2aa5059fdedcdd85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70599d68-1c59-4a6a-a5bf-06e681cf4a01", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "841089e571ae8dae880a3acd28463051b31bfcb81cac2423fd225eda04274806", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4469b6aa-39f3-47c2-9ec7-4c6bf25d1cb6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa7d4fafb49e8b3a89a353bf1967fe18b7ff1d3ffe737f5a8371688c162d92c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "01e585bb477bee4ce03126352ffc7823ae1cece5dcbfd9375903b1e25e5b69eb", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Among the aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that have affected or may in the future affect ourbusinesses are: increased capital, liquidity and reportingrequirements; limitations on activities in which we mayengage; increased regulation of and restrictions on OTCderivatives markets and transactions; limitations onincentive compensation; limitations on affiliatetransactions; requirements to reorganize or limit activitiesin connection with recovery and resolution planning;increased deposit insurance assessments; and increasedstandards of care for broker-dealers and investmentadvisers in dealing with clients. The implementation ofhigher capital requirements, more stringent requirementsrelating to liquidity, long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity and the prohibition on proprietarytrading and the sponsorship of, or investment in, coveredfunds by the Volcker Rule may continue to adversely affectour profitability and competitive position, particularly ifthese requirements do not apply equally to our competitorsor are not implemented uniformly across jurisdictions. Wemay also become subject to higher and more stringentcapital and other regulatory requirements as a result of theimplementation of Basel Committee standards, includingthe new credit and operational risk capital standardspublished in December 2017 and the new market riskcapital standard published in January 2019.As described in \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation \u2014 Banking\nSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of thisForm 10-K, the SCB has replaced the capital conservationbuffer under the Standardized Capital Rules and resulted inhigher Standardized capital ratio requirements. Failure tocomply with these requirements could limit our ability to,among other things, repurchase shares, pay dividends andmake certain discretionary compensation payments. Inaddition, if, as in 2020, we are required to resubmit ourcapital plan, we generally may not make capitaldistributions, such as share repurchases or dividends,without the prior approval of the FRB. Dividends andrepurchases are also subject to oversight by the FRB, whichcan result in limitations. Limitations on our ability to makecapital distributions could, among other things, prevent usfrom returning capital to our shareholders and impact ourreturn on equity. Additionally, as a G-SIB, we are subject tothe G-SIB surcharge. Our G-SIB surcharge is updatedannually based on financial data from the prior year.Expansion of our businesses, growth in our balance sheetand increased reliance on short-term wholesale fundinghave resulted in increases and in the future may result infurther increases in our G-SIB surcharge and acorresponding increase in our capital requirements.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the\nGDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, relatingto the privacy of the information of clients, employees orothers, and any failure to comply with these laws andregulations could expose us to liability and/or reputationaldamage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations areimplemented, the time and resources needed for us tocomply with such laws and regulations, as well as ourpotential liability for non-compliance and reportingobligations in the case of data breaches, may significantlyincrease.\nIn addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws\nand regulations relating to surveillance, encryption anddata on-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate.Compliance with these laws and regulations may require usto change our policies, procedures and technology forinformation security, which could, among other things,make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks andmisappropriation, corruption or loss of information ortechnology.\n44 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4694, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "038fad99-1f24-4e5c-ba1e-69ebd5126f5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "038fad99-1f24-4e5c-ba1e-69ebd5126f5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dcce3475-b180-49ed-9583-9b0d333aaf27", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3d81d3b201954084ac87285985d3113e1461883eeb48a30fe02a05f624f798f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "28352f30-740f-41eb-a79f-877fef9d5bdc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "36b04a8d44628d4c144148c15c66265da03cce78f757dab1b1f41bf58b6b801f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9303c947-9575-4bcf-a013-ebf1e8e3dba5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1296e2f08768a2baddbcc5ca03d486b78b69f12fe9061909ba50a7aa5135dc78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1396e7a774bf6da49bc1e919adcd124a470284090f1c0d1abb09b70acce51aab", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Not only are these regulations extensive, but theyinvolve types of regulations and supervision, as well asregulatory compliance risks, that have not historicallyapplied to us. The level of regulatory scrutiny and the scopeof regulations affecting financial interactions withconsumers is often much greater than that associated withdoing business with institutions and high-net-worthindividuals. Complying with these regulations is time-consuming, costly and presents new and increased risks.\nIncreasingly, regulators and courts have sought to hold\nfinancial institutions liable for the misconduct of theirclients where they have determined that the financialinstitution should have detected that the client was engagedin wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had nodirect knowledge of the activities engaged in by its client.Regulators and courts have also increasingly found liabilityas a \u201ccontrol person\u201d for activities of entities in whichfinancial institutions or funds controlled by financialinstitutions have an investment, but which they do notactively manage. In addition, regulators and courtscontinue to seek to establish \u201cfiduciary\u201d obligations tocounterparties to which no such duty had been assumed toexist. To the extent that such efforts are successful, the costof, and liabilities associated with, engaging in brokerage,clearing, market-making, prime brokerage, investing andother similar activities could increase significantly. To theextent that we have fiduciary obligations in connectionwith acting as a financial adviser or investment adviser or inother roles for individual, institutional, sovereign orinvestment fund clients, any breach, or even an allegedbreach, of such obligations could have materially negativelegal, regulatory and reputational consequences.\nFor information about the extensive regulation to which\nour businesses are subject, see \u201cBusiness \u2014 Regulation\u201d inPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.A failure to appropriately identify and address\npotential conflicts of interest could adversely affectour businesses.\nDue to the broad scope of our businesses and our client\nbase, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest,including situations where our services to a particular clientor our own investments or other interests conflict, or areperceived to conflict, with the interests of that client oranother client, as well as situations where one or more ofour businesses have access to material non-publicinformation that may not be shared with our otherbusinesses and situations where we may be a creditor of anentity with which we also have an advisory or otherrelationship.\nIn addition, our status as a BHC subjects us to heightened\nregulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the FRBwith respect to transactions between GS Bank USA and itssubsidiaries and entities that are or could be viewed asaffiliates of ours and, under the Volcker Rule, transactionsbetween us and covered funds.\nWe have extensive procedures and controls that are\ndesigned to identify and address conflicts of interest,including those designed to prevent the improper sharing ofinformation among our businesses. However,appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts ofinterest is complex and difficult, and our reputation, whichis one of our most important assets, could be damaged andthe willingness of clients to enter into transactions with usmay be adversely affected if we fail, or appear to fail, toidentify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts ofinterest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts couldgive rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.Additionally, our One Goldman Sachs initiative aims to\nincrease collaboration among our businesses, which mayincrease the potential for actual or perceived conflicts ofinterest and improper information sharing.\nWe may be adversely affected by increased\ngovernmental and regulatory scrutiny or negativepublicity.\nGovernmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies\nand law enforcement agencies with respect to mattersrelating to compensation, our business practices, our pastactions and other matters remains at high levels.

Governmentalauthorities may also be more likely to pursue criminal orother actions, including seeking admissions of wrongdoingor guilty pleas, in connection with the resolution of aninquiry or investigation to the extent a company is viewed ashaving previously engaged in criminal, regulatory or othermisconduct. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny andlegal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negativeimpact on our reputation and on the morale andperformance of our employees, which could adversely affectour businesses and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry generally and our businesses\nin particular have been subject to negative publicity.

Thetrend of large settlements with governmental entities mayadversely affect the outcomes for other financialinstitutions in similar actions, especially wheregovernmental officials have announced that the largesettlements will be used as the basis or a template for othersettlements. The uncertain regulatory enforcementenvironment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses,which can lead to substantial disparities between legalreserves and subsequent actual settlements or penalties.\nClaims of collusion or anti-competitive conduct have\nbecome more common.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution proceedings and\nthat support from Group Inc. or other available resourcesto its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries toremain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level would betransferred to Group Inc. and ultimately borne by GroupInc.\u2019s security holders, third-party creditors of Group Inc.\u2019ssubsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims,and Group Inc.\u2019s security holders (including ourshareholders, debtholders and other unsecured creditors)could face significant and possibly complete losses. In thatcase, Group Inc.\u2019s security holders would face losses whilethe third-party creditors of Group Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries wouldincur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue tooperate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcyproceedings. In addition, holders of Group Inc.\u2019s eligiblelong-term debt and holders of Group Inc.\u2019s other debtsecurities could face losses ahead of its other similarlysituated creditors in a resolution under OLA if the FDICexercised its right, described above, to disregard the priorityof creditor claims.\nOLA also provides the FDIC with authority to cause\ncreditors and shareholders of the financial company inreceivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed tosuch losses, and amounts owed to the U.S. governmentwould generally receive a statutory payment priority overthe claims of private creditors, including senior creditors.\nIn addition, under OLA, claims of creditors (including\ndebtholders) could be satisfied through the issuance ofequity or other securities in a bridge entity to which GroupInc.\u2019s assets are transferred. If such a securities-for-claimsexchange were implemented, there can be no assurance thatthe value of the securities of the bridge entity would besufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditorclaims for which the securities were exchanged. While theFDIC has issued regulations to implement OLA, not allaspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority areknown and additional rulemaking is possible.In addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and the\nE.U., have implemented resolution regimes to provideresolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize afailing entity by writing down its unsecured debt orconverting its unsecured debt into equity. Such \u201cbail-in\u201dpowers are intended to enable the recapitalization of afailing institution by allocating losses to its shareholdersand unsecured debtholders. For example, the Bank ofEngland requires a certain amount of intercompanyfunding that we provide to our material U.K. subsidiaries tocontain a contractual trigger to expressly permit the Bankof England to exercise such \u201cbail-in\u201d powers in certaincircumstances. If the intercompany funding we provide toour subsidiaries is \u201cbailed in,\u201d Group Inc.\u2019s claims on itssubsidiaries would be subordinated to the claims of thesubsidiaries\u2019 third-party creditors or written down. U.S.regulators are considering and non-U.S. authorities haveadopted requirements that certain subsidiaries of largefinancial institutions maintain minimum amounts of totalloss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from thesubsidiaries to the top-tier BHC and, ultimately, to securityholders of the top-tier BHC in the event of failure.\nThe application of Group Inc.\u2019s proposed resolution\nstrategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.\u2019ssecurity holders.\nIn our resolution plan, Group Inc. would be resolved under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy described in ourresolution plan is a variant of the single point of entrystrategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC(Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of GroupInc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certainmajor subsidiaries, including through the forgiveness ofintercompany indebtedness, the extension of the maturitiesof intercompany indebtedness and the extension ofadditional intercompany loans. If this strategy weresuccessful, creditors of some or all of Group Inc.\u2019s majorsubsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims,while Group Inc.\u2019s security holders could face significantand possibly complete losses.\nTo facilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we\nformed Funding IHC. In exchange for an unsecuredsubordinated funding note and equity interest, Group Inc.transferred certain intercompany receivables andsubstantially all of its GCLA to Funding IHC, and agreed totransfer additional GCLA above prescribed thresholds.\n48 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4575, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ad5736c-ae8d-4db3-b2f9-5ba03a1cd812": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ad5736c-ae8d-4db3-b2f9-5ba03a1cd812", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93e15517-962e-4546-9e7e-63b550084659", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "17fdb7e9d6ce9bbc587700a894c1b9927a76b41eb55fe881a021bdbaa6d429fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4b5787a-02c7-4a80-a335-86f4218be17f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "58e5235031643f7345be9c6f5fe37c7b242be3924ae9373a5f02863ace421544", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a066010-7860-4868-9f55-819cc444eebb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bcb55b0125837bfddb64e6314bb64d523491918fd5e8863ee9ffe2587b886917", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e7bb664800c097708ea0a83a534bd8d5fcb77786ecf3614b336f199dfcba23ba", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe financial services industry is highly interrelated in that\na significant volume of transactions occur among a limitednumber of members of that industry. Many transactions aresyndicated to other financial institutions and financialinstitutions are often counterparties in transactions. Thishas led to claims by other market participants andregulators that such institutions have colluded in order tomanipulate markets or market prices, including allegationsthat antitrust laws have been violated. While we haveextensive procedures and controls that are designed toidentify and prevent such activities, allegations of suchactivities, particularly by regulators, can have a negativereputational impact and can subject us to large fines andsettlements, and potentially significant penalties, includingtreble damages.\nThe growth of electronic trading and the introduction\nof new products and technologies, including tradingtechnologies and cryptocurrencies, has increasedcompetition.\nTechnology is fundamental to our business and our\nindustry. The growth of electronic trading and theintroduction of new technologies is changing our businessesand presenting us with new challenges. Securities, futuresand options transactions are increasingly occurringelectronically, both on our own systems and through otheralternative trading systems, and it appears that the trendtoward alternative trading systems will continue. Some ofthese alternative trading systems compete with us,particularly our exchange-based market-making activities,and we may experience continued competitive pressures inthese and other areas. In addition, the increased use by ourclients of low-cost electronic trading systems and directelectronic access to trading markets could cause a reductionin commissions and spreads. As our clients increasingly useour systems to trade directly in the markets, we may incurliabilities as a result of their use of our order routing andexecution infrastructure.\nWe have invested significant resources into the\ndevelopment of electronic trading systems and expect tocontinue to do so, but there is no assurance that therevenues generated by these systems will yield an adequatereturn, particularly given the generally lower commissionsarising from electronic trades.In addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new\ntechnologies, including distributed ledgers, such ascryptocurrencies and blockchain, have required us to investresources to adapt our existing products and services, andwe expect to continue to make such investments, whichcould be material. The adoption and evolution of such newtechnologies may also increase our compliance andregulatory costs. Further, technologies, such ascryptocurrencies, that do not require intermediation couldalso significantly disrupt payments processing and otherfinancial services. Regulatory limitations on ourinvolvement in products and platforms involvingtechnologies such as cryptocurrencies may not applyequally or in some cases at all to certain of our competitors.We may not be as timely or successful in developing orintegrating, or even able to develop or integrate, newproducts and technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, intoour existing products and services, adapting to changes inconsumer preferences or achieving market acceptance ofour products and services, any of which could affect ourability to attract or retain clients, cause us to lose marketshare or result in service disruptions and in turn reduce ourrevenues or otherwise adversely affect us.\nOur businesses would be adversely affected if we are\nunable to hire and retain qualified employees.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and\nefforts of highly skilled people; therefore, our continuedability to compete effectively in our businesses, to manageour businesses effectively and to expand into newbusinesses and geographic areas depends on our ability toattract new talented and diverse employees and to retainand motivate our existing employees. Factors that affectour ability to attract and retain such employees include thelevel and composition of our compensation and benefits,and our reputation as a successful business with a culture offairly hiring, training and promoting qualified employees.\nAs a significant portion of the compensation that we pay to\nour employees is in the form of year-end discretionarycompensation, a significant portion of which is in the formof deferred equity-related awards, declines in ourprofitability, or in the outlook for our future profitability,as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels andterms, can negatively impact our ability to hire and retainhighly qualified employees.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 51", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4761, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a7eae78-7334-4171-8d85-eef14d5d7b19": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a7eae78-7334-4171-8d85-eef14d5d7b19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a41c0a4a-afdb-43e7-9637-bf79ca7bce5d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "07379f7812e18fe84ef7f74d7069b2167b836318dd4e75c124e8fdc7b0bade81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "88af3148-f7e1-46bd-b7ab-715dec2c17ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d75d7adacdfd5d13ca39bf04e55f91b7fca89d036b623674c5b9047de5008230", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d97bce91-94f7-46fc-ae5a-3cb850e37012", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4ff3a55706d09c4b9af383a20ef5e7426a8da16b126c62496b0066f0ad9162a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d769ca34fbb526924f055c5ea2abb7c8cfd2bee5f61e89a913bab88a562eda6a", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Further, identity fraud may increase and creditreporting practices may change in a manner that makes itmore difficult for financial institutions, such as us, toevaluate the creditworthiness of consumers.\n54 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5032, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8db5c6a-ed2f-4f4e-be1d-32c6771f1275": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8db5c6a-ed2f-4f4e-be1d-32c6771f1275", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "060bbc41-d4a4-4ff3-a332-360c363e8b6f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4808eb3e4e42973e63ef77c37c0411c09628e251b12460be309a1cbc981fdfa7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d23f39da-6481-4345-af1e-de76e64723c2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "53bfb779ae9e29c83c8fae1f37959b9d2a614e0671d6a4a5092dcc8b33d60506", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f8e3439b-aca9-4360-8d70-76d1306663bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d4f664f4c4aeb8e6931401cc438b4ef32ce790221f49a5a8a1e5748c73bc018", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "456c254dfe1b445496571419958521651c0d4d3efabd2dac1d439a2e820a4832", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

As a result, we expect to faceadditional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, includingwith respect to know-your-customer, anti-money launderingand reporting requirements and prohibitions on transfers ofproperty belonging to countries, entities and individualssubject to sanctions by U.S. or other governmental authorities.\nNew business initiatives expose us to new and enhanced\nrisks, including risks associated with dealing withgovernmental entities, reputational concerns arising fromdealing with different types of clients, business partners,counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny ofthese activities, increased credit-related, market, sovereignand operational risks, risks arising from accidents or acts ofterrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner inwhich certain assets are being operated or held or in whichwe interact with these clients, business partners,counterparties and investors. Legal, regulatory andreputational risks may also exist in connection with activitiesand transactions involving new products or markets wherethere is regulatory uncertainty or where there are different orconflicting regulations depending on the regulator or thejurisdiction involved, particularly where transactions in suchproducts may involve multiple jurisdictions.\nWe have developed and pursued new business and strategic\ninitiatives, including acquisitions, and expect to continue todo so. If and to the extent we are unable to successfullyexecute those initiatives, we may incur unanticipated costsand losses, and face other adverse consequences, such asnegative reputational effects. In addition, the actual effectsof pursuing those initiatives may differ, possibly materially,from the benefits that we expect to realize from them, suchas generating additional revenues, achieving expensesavings, reducing operational risk exposures or usingcapital and funding more efficiently. Engaging in newactivities exposes us to a variety of risks, including that wemay be unable to successfully develop new, competitive,efficient and effective systems and processes, and hire andretain the necessary personnel. Due to our lack of historicalexperience with unsecured consumer lending, our loan lossassumptions may prove to be incorrect and we may incurlosses significantly above those which we originallyanticipated in entering the business or in expanding theproduct offerings for the business.\nIn recent years, we have invested, and may continue to\ninvest, more in businesses that we expect will generate ahigher level of more consistent revenues. In order to developand be able to offer consumer financial products thatcompete effectively, we have made and expect to continueto make significant investments in technology and humancapital resources in connection with our consumer-orientedactivities.

Anyfuture acquisitions could involve the issuance of commonstock and/or the payment of cash as consideration. Thesuccess of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on ourability to integrate the acquired businesses and realizeanticipated synergies, cost savings and growthopportunities. We may face numerous risks anduncertainties in combining and integrating the relevantbusinesses and systems, including the need to combine orseparate accounting and data processing systems andmanagement controls and to integrate relationships withclients, counterparties, regulators and others in connectionwith acquisitions. Integration of acquired businesses istime-consuming and could disrupt our ongoing businesses,produce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulties,cause us to incur incremental expenses or requireincremental financial, management and other resources. Itis also possible that an acquisition, once announced, maynot close due to the failure to satisfy applicable closingconditions, such as the receipt of necessary shareholder orregulatory approvals.\nThere is no assurance that any of our acquisitions will be\nsuccessfully integrated or yield all of the expected positivebenefits and synergies in the time frames that we expect, orat all.

Economic activity continued to benefit fromongoing fiscal stimulus from governments and continuedaccommodative monetary policy from global central banks.In the second half of the year, the growth in economicactivity and demand for goods and services, alongsidesupply chain complications, contributed to inflationarypressures. Late in the year, the surge in Omicron casessparked renewed concerns globally, contributing toincreased market volatility and increased pressures on laborsupply. This may result in a negative impact on economicactivity.\nDespite broad improvements in the overall economy since\nthe initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertaintyremains on the pace of the recovery going forward, reflectingconcerns about virus resurgence from the Omicron variantand other possible variants and related concerns regardingvaccine distribution, efficacy and hesitancy, as well asconcerns relating to inflation, supply chain complicationsand geopolitical risks.

Trading assets and liabilities, certain\ninvestments and loans, and certain other financial assets andliabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets atfair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains orlosses generally recognized in our consolidated statements ofearnings. The use of fair value to measure financialinstruments is fundamental to our risk management practicesand is our most critical accounting policy.\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liabilityin an orderly transaction between market participants at themeasurement date. We measure certain financial assets andliabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure tomarket and/or credit risks). In determining fair value, thehierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles(U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quotedprices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets orliabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs otherthan level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly orindirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputsthat cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). Inevaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider,among other factors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to thatinput. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety basedon the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair valuemeasurement.\nThe fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and\nliabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and areclassified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Our control infrastructure isindependent of the revenue-producing units and isfundamental to ensuring that all of our financialinstruments are appropriately valued at market-clearinglevels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion insituations where estimating the fair value of financialinstruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to marketcomparables or trade comparison, as described below), thefinal valuation decision is made by senior managers inindependent risk oversight and control functions. Thisindependent price verification is critical to ensuring that ourfinancial instruments are properly valued.\nPrice Verification. All financial instruments at fair value\nclassified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy aresubject to our independent price verification process. Theobjective of price verification is to have an informed andindependent opinion with regard to the valuation offinancial instruments under review.

Analysis of trade data (both internal\nand external, where available) is used to determine themost relevant pricing inputs and valuations.\n\u2030External Price Comparison. Valuations and prices are\ncompared to pricing data obtained from third parties(e.g., brokers or dealers, IHS Markit, Bloomberg, IDC,TRACE). Data obtained from various sources iscompared to ensure consistency and validity.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe estimate and record an allowance for credit lossesrelated to our loans held for investment that are accountedfor at amortized cost. To determine the allowance for creditlosses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized costinto wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfoliosrepresent the level at which we have developed anddocumented our methodology to determine the allowancefor credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measuredon a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar riskcharacteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specificbasis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics.\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the\nweighted average of a range of forecasts of future economicconditions over the expected life of the loans and lendingcommitments. The expected life of each loan or lendingcommitment is determined based on the contractual termadjusted for extension options or demand features, or ismodeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. Theforecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economicscenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expectedlives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical lossinformation based on a non-linear modeled approach. Weapply judgment in weighting individual scenarios eachquarter based on a variety of factors, including ourinternally derived economic outlook, market consensus,recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. Theforecasted economic scenarios consider a number of riskfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios.Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal creditratings, industry default and loss data, expected life,macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates andGDP), the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet its financialobligations, the borrower\u2019s country of risk and industry,loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loansbacked by real estate, risk factors include loan-to-valueratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factorsfor installment and credit card loans include Fair IsaacCorporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loanvintage and macroeconomic indicators.\nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative\ncomponents which allow management to reflect theuncertain nature of economic forecasting, captureuncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for modelimprecision and concentration risk.Our estimate of credit losses entails judgment about\ncollectability at the reporting dates, and there areuncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowancefor credit losses is subject to a governance process thatinvolves review and approval by senior management withinour independent risk oversight and control functions.Personnel within our independent risk oversight andcontrol functions are responsible for forecasting theeconomic variables that underlie the economic scenariosthat are used in the modeling of expected credit losses.While we use the best information available to determinethis estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may benecessary based on, among other things, changes in theeconomic environment or variances between actual resultsand the original assumptions used. Loans are charged offagainst the allowance for loan losses when deemed to beuncollectible.\nWe also record an allowance for credit losses on lending\ncommitments which are held for investment that areaccounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance isdetermined using the same methodology as the allowancefor loan losses, while also taking into consideration theprobability of drawdowns or funding, and whether suchcommitments are cancellable by us.\nTo estimate the potential impact of an adverse\nmacroeconomic environment on our allowance for creditlosses, we, among other things, compared the expectedcredit losses under the weighted average forecast used in thecalculation of allowance for credit losses as ofDecember 2021 (which was primarily weighted towards thebaseline economic scenario) to the expected credit lossesunder a 100% weighted adverse economic scenario. Theadverse macroeconomic model assumes an emergence ofnew vaccine-resistant strains of COVID-19 resulting in aresurgence of infections, an economic contraction, highinflation rates in the initial quarters, gradually climbingunemployment rates, decline in GDP growth rates anddislocations in the economy due to shortages in the supplyof some goods and services. A 100% weighting to theadverse economic scenario would have resulted in anapproximate $1.3 billion increase in our allowance forcredit losses as of December 2021. This hypotheticalincrease does not take into consideration any potentialadjustments to qualitative reserves. The forecasts ofmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain and donot take into account any other offsetting or correlatedeffects. The actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomicenvironment may differ significantly from this estimate.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nUse of Estimates\nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and\nassumptions. In addition to the estimates we make inconnection with fair value measurements and the allowancefor credit losses on loans and lending commitments held forinvestment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use ofestimates and assumptions is also important in determiningthe accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangibleassets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigationand regulatory proceedings (including governmentalinvestigations), and accounting for income taxes.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth\nquarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstanceschange that indicate an impairment may exist. Whenassessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitativeassessment can be made to determine whether it is morelikely than not that the estimated fair value of a reportingunit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results ofthe qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitativegoodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitativegoodwill test can be performed without performing aqualitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of ourreporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fairvalue estimates include projected earnings and allocatedequity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projectedearnings. The estimated carrying value of each reportingunit reflects an allocation of total shareholders\u2019 equity andrepresents the estimated amount of total shareholders\u2019equity required to support the activities of the reportingunit under currently applicable regulatory capitalrequirements. See Note 12 to the consolidated financialstatements for further information about goodwill. If weexperience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in thebusiness environment, financial markets, our performanceor our common stock price, or additional increases incapital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in thefuture.\nIdentifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment\nwhen events or changes in circumstances suggest that anasset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s carrying value may not be fullyrecoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whetherindications of potential impairment have occurred, and totest intangible assets for impairment, if required. Animpairment is recognized if the estimated undiscountedcash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than thecorresponding carrying value. See Note 12 to theconsolidated financial statem ents for further information\nabout identifiable intangible assets.We also estimate and provide for potential losses that may\narise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to theextent that such losses are probable and can be reasonablyestimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of therange of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of therelated reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedingswhere we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. SeeNotes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statementsfor information about certain judicial, litigation andregulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required inmaking these estimates and our final liabilities mayultimately be materially different. Our total estimatedliability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings isdetermined on a case-by-case basis and represents anestimate of probable losses after considering, among otherfactors, the progress of each case, proceeding orinvestigation, our experience and the experience of othersin similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and theopinions and views of legal counsel.\nIn accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions\nin the financial statements only when it is more likely thannot that the position will be sustained on examination bythe relevant taxing authority based on the technical meritsof the position. As of December 2021, our net liability forunrecognized tax benefits was $1.16 billion. We useestimates to recognize current and deferred income taxes inthe U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions inwhich we operate. The income tax laws in thesejurisdictions are complex and can be subject to differentinterpretations between taxpayers and taxing authorities.Disputes may arise over these interpretations and can besettled by audit, administrative appeals or judicialproceedings. Our interpretations are reevaluated quarterlybased on guidance currently available, tax examinationexperience and the opinions of legal counsel, among otherfactors. We recognize deferred taxes based on the amountthat will more likely than not be realized in the future basedon enacted income tax laws. As of December 2021, we had$6.32 billion of deferred tax assets with a related valuationallowance of $895 million. Our estimate for deferred taxesincludes estimates for future taxable earnings, including thelevel and character of those earnings, and various taxplanning strategies.

During 2021, a general recovery\nof the global economy, continued monetary and fiscalsupport from central banks and governments andaccelerating vaccine distribution provided a favorablemarket backdrop. These factors contributed to generallyhigher global equity prices and tighter credit spreadscompared with the end of 2020. In addition, market-making activities reflected strong client activity levels,although activity declined from a very strong prior yearwhich reflected heightened volatility and significant marketdislocations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, andinvestment banking activity levels across mergers andacquisitions and underwriting were elevated.\nIf concerns about the economic outlook, including those on\ninflation and supply chain issues, grow or the ongoingefforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemicare ineffective (including due to new variants orcomplications with vaccine distribution, efficacy andhesitancy), it may lead to a decline in global equity markets,a decline in investment banking activity levels, and acontinued decline in market-making activity levels, and netrevenues and the provision for credit losses would likely benegatively impacted.

Net revenues in the consolidated\nstatements of earnings were $59.34 billion for 2021, 33%higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher otherprincipal transactions revenues, investment bankingrevenues and net interest income, and higher investmentmanagement revenues.Non-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in\nthe consolidated statements of earnings were $14.17 billionfor 2021, 55% higher than 2020, due to significantly higherrevenues in financial advisory, reflecting a significantincrease in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, inequity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and in debtunderwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wideleveraged finance activity.\nInvestment management revenues in the consolidated\nstatements of earnings were $8.06 billion for 2021, 16%higher than 2020, primarily due to higher management andother fees, reflecting the impact of higher average AUS,partially offset by higher fee waivers on money marketfunds. In addition, incentive fees were significantly higher,primarily driven by harvesting.\nCommissions and fees in the consolidated statements of\nearnings were $3.62 billion for 2021, slightly higher than2020.\nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of\nearnings were $15.35 billion for 2021, essentiallyunchanged compared with 2020, as significantly lowerrevenues in interest rate products and credit products werelargely offset by significantly higher revenues in equityproducts (primarily in derivatives) and commodities, andimproved results in mortgages.\nOther principal transactions revenues in the consolidated\nstatements of earnings were $11.67 billion for 2021,compared with $4.65 billion for 2020, primarily reflectingsignificantly higher net gains from investments in privateequities and in debt instruments, partially offset by netlosses from investments in public equities compared withsignificant net gains in 2020.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in the\nconsolidated statements of earnings was $6.47 billion for2021, 36% higher than 2020, reflecting a decrease ininterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interestincome. The decrease in interest expense is primarily relatedto other interest-bearing liabilities, deposits and long-termborrowings, each reflecting the impact of lower interestrates. The decrease in interest income primarily related tocollateralized agreements and trading assets, both reflectingthe impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by theimpact of higher average balances for loans.

During 2021, U.K. deferredtax assets and liabilities were remeasured and a deferred taxbenefit of approximately $100 million was recognized. TheFinance (No. 2) Bill 2021-22, issued in November 2021,includes a five percent reduction in the U.K. bank surchargetax rate, effective from April 2023. The bank surcharge iscurrently applicable to certain of our U.K. subsidiaries andbranches, including Goldman Sachs International (GSI) andGoldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB). FollowingRoyal Assent, the associated impact of any change to thebank surcharge on U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilitiescould have a material impact on our effective tax rate,depending on the operating results for the quarter duringwhich this legislation is enacted.\nWe expect our tax rate for 2022 to be between 20% and\n21%, excluding the impact of income tax benefits onemployee share-based awards and any potential changes incurrent income tax rates.\nSegment Assets and Operating Results\nSegment Assets.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nOperating Environment. During 2021, Investment\nBanking operated in an environment characterized bystrong industry-wide activity. In mergers and acquisitions,industry-wide completed and announced volumes were athigh levels, reflecting supportive market conditions andstrong CEO confidence. In underwriting, industry-wideactivity levels reflected continued strength in equityunderwriting volumes, including strong initial publicofferings activity, and solid debt underwriting volumes,including elevated leveraged finance activity.\nIn the future, if market and economic conditions\ndeteriorate, and industry-wide mergers and acquisitionsvolumes decline, or if industry-wide equity and debtunderwriting volumes decline, or credit spreads related tohedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten further,net revenues in Investment Banking would likely benegatively impacted. In addition, a deterioration in thecreditworthiness of borrowers would negatively impact theprovision for credit losses.\n2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Investment Banking\nwere $14.88 billion for 2021, 58% higher than 2020,primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues inFinancial advisory and Underwriting.\nThe increase in Financial advisory net revenues reflected a\nsignificant increase in completed mergers and acquisitionsvolumes. The increase in Underwriting net revenues wasdue to significantly higher net revenues in both Equityunderwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wideinitial public offerings activity, and Debt underwriting,primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveragedfinance activity. Corporate lending net revenues weresignificantly higher, primarily reflecting net gains fromlending activities compared with net losses in the prior year,and significantly higher net interest income.\nProvision for credit losses was a net benefit of $298 million\nfor 2021, compared with net provisions of $1.62 billion for2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the currentyear reflecting continued improvement in the broadereconomic environment following challenging conditions in2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating expenses were $6.71 billion for 2021, 9% higher\nthan 2020, due to significantly higher compensation andbenefits expenses (reflecting strong performance), partiallyoffset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation andregulatory proceedings. Pre-tax earnings were $8.47 billionfor 2021, compared with $1.67 billion for 2020. ROE was64.8% for 2021, compared with 10.5% for 2020 (whichincluded the impact of net provisions for litigation andregulatory proceedings that reduced ROE by 11.5percentage points).As of December 2021, our investment banking transaction\nbacklog increased significantly compared withDecember 2020, due to significantly higher estimated netrevenues from potential financial advisory transactions andpotential debt underwriting transactions (particularly fromleveraged finance transactions), and higher estimated netrevenues from potential equity underwriting transactions.\nOur backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues\nfrom future transactions where we believe that futurerevenue realization is more likely than not. We believechanges in our backlog may be a useful indicator of clientactivity levels which, over the long term, impact our netrevenues. However, the time frame for completion andcorresponding revenue recognition of transactions in ourbacklog varies based on the nature of the assignment, ascertain transactions may remain in our backlog for longerperiods of time. In addition, our backlog is subject tocertain limitations, such as assumptions about thelikelihood that individual client transactions will occur inthe future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, andtransactions not included in the estimate may also occur.\nGlobal Markets\nOur Global Markets segment consists of:\nFICC.

In addition,we execute swap transactions to provide our clients withexposure to securities and indices.Market-Making Activities\nAs a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquidand less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients,such as corporations, financial institutions, investmentfunds and governments, to assist clients in meeting theirinvestment objectives and in managing their risks. In thisrole, we seek to earn the difference between the price atwhich a market participant is willing to sell an instrumentto us and the price at which another market participant iswilling to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offerspread). In addition, we maintain (i) market-makingpositions, typically for a short period of time, in responseto, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions toactively manage our risk exposures that arise from thesemarket-making activities (collectively, inventory). Ourinventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) ortrading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidatedbalance sheets.\nOur results are influenced by a combination of\ninterconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels andtransactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity),and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory andinterest income and interest expense related to the holding,hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature ofour market-making activities, disaggregation of netrevenues into client activity and market-making inventorychanges is judgmental and has inherent complexities andlimitations.\nThe amount and composition of our net revenues vary over\ntime as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelatedfactors affecting economic and market conditions,including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes ininterest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads,equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence,and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties.\nIn general, assuming all other market-making conditions\nremain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, anddecreases tend to have the opposite effect. However,changes in market-making conditions can materially impactclient activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fairvalue of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidityin the market could have the impact of (i) increasing ourbid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence andthereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) wideningof credit spreads on our inventory positions.\n70 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5092, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af36efb6-ad91-41c3-a781-be07edc03f3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "af36efb6-ad91-41c3-a781-be07edc03f3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c9798e8-3d1b-47d3-86e0-9f706a19b703", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3c63224abafb3a38a96c375e27224329f78c83b6e36999d23ff9afb2b557824f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d05c1ed-5866-4409-b0c4-aef9b1df07da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9abd923018ea273221c2d4af2ba24bcd193e713baab7d1fd0533fdf7b0d84452", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6819d08-1711-49b9-9ed6-f2e14950990f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a2701834539fc5c9e169ce79aebbe7cdd33782edcc8aaff2f04cfce72a089411", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bb125eab9c0f4729cddde94fb53e6fa2b3db2dedcb265e127661f2f89faed8f9", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nBalance Sheet and Funding Sources\nBalance Sheet Management\nOne of our risk management disciplines is our ability tomanage the size and composition of our balance sheet.While our asset base changes due to client activity, marketfluctuations and business opportunities, the size andcomposition of our balance sheet also reflects factors,including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount ofcapital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among otherfactors. See \u201cCapital Management and RegulatoryCapital \u2014 Capital Management\u201d for information aboutour capital management process.\nAlthough our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day\nbasis, our total assets at quarter-end and year-end dates aregenerally not materially different from those occurringwithin our reporting periods.\nIn order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to\nmaintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and haveprocesses in place to dynamically manage our assets andliabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning,(ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and(iv) scenario analyses.\nBalance Sheet Planning. We prepare a balance sheet plan\nthat combines our projected total assets and composition ofassets with our expected funding sources over a three-yeartime horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may beadjusted in response to changing business needs or marketconditions. The objectives of this planning process are:\n\u2030To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into\naccount the general state of the financial markets andexpected business activity levels, as well as regulatoryrequirements;\n\u2030To allow Treasury and our independent risk oversight\nand control functions to objectively evaluate balancesheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units inthe context of our overall balance sheet constraints,including our liability profile and capital levels, and keymetrics; and\n\u2030To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to\nraise, based on our projected assets and contractualmaturities.\nTreasury and our independent risk oversight and control\nfunctions, along with our revenue-producing units, reviewcurrent and prior period information and expectations forthe year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specificinformation reviewed includes asset and liability size andcomposition, limit utilization, risk and performancemeasures, and capital usage.Our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance\nsheets by business, funding projections and projected keymetrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide AssetLiability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee.See \u201cRisk Management \u2014 Overview and Structure of RiskManagement\u201d for an overview of our risk managementstructure.\nBalance Sheet Limits. The Firmwide Asset Liability\nCommittee and the Risk Governance Committee have theresponsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits.These limits are set at levels which are close to actualoperating levels, rather than at levels which reflect ourmaximum risk appetite, in order to ensure promptescalation and discussion among our revenue-producingunits, Treasury and our independent risk oversight andcontrol functions on a routine basis. Requests for changesin limits are evaluated after giving consideration to theirimpact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits ismonitored by our revenue-producing units and Treasury, aswell as our independent risk oversight and controlfunctions.\nMonitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance\nsheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis,including asset and liability size and composition, limitutilization and risk measures. We attribute assets tobusinesses and review and analyze movements resultingfrom new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.\nScenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario\nanalyses, including as part of CCAR and U.S. Dodd-FrankWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act StressTests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recoveryplanning. See \u201cCapital Management and RegulatoryCapital \u2014 Capital Management\u201d for further informationabout these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short-and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomicand firm-specific assumptions, based on a range ofeconomic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us indeveloping our longer-term balance sheet managementstrategy, including the level and composition of assets,funding and capital. Additionally, these analyses help usdevelop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding,liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, includinga severely stressed environment.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 79", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4734, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e9cbc3c-c98f-487c-b76e-4ee1d92d3500": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e9cbc3c-c98f-487c-b76e-4ee1d92d3500", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e107b8f-f518-4683-854c-87258aaed087", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "39bfa36ca5fe3d90c6e36a28efee1471db51050334c546b1b3ed01c80098eab3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "24ea6c57-484b-4d63-9e73-14cf41736b5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "769db76e2d66b5b047e371f8d1ed90b1198383b2149885d75d811dbb754e1af8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "36a6d275-33eb-471b-b69b-97350fd40e45", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1d70cb0e122c5b436fc6ca6f6325db87d61c4043b5bf455c2cd788ba067ea35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1658c2021303f0f5dd9d9ed03018b229ac629cc79edd3f1b8d690bf5e36a985c", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We believe that our relationships with ourcreditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks,governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds,insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We haveimposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditorconcentration across our funding programs.\nDeposits. Our deposits provide us with a diversified source\nof funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding.We raise deposits, including savings, demand and timedeposits, from private bank clients, consumers, transactionbanking clients, other institutional clients, and throughinternal and third-party broker-dealers. Substantially all ofour deposits are raised through GS Bank USA and GSIB.See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements forfurther information about our deposits, including amaturity profile of our time deposits.\nSecured Funding. We fund a significant amount of inventory\nand a portion of investments on a secured basis. Secured fundingincludes collateralized financings in the consolidated balancesheets. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements forfurther information about our collateralized financings,including its maturity profile. We may also pledge our inventoryand investments as collateral for securities borrowed under asecurities lending agreement. We also use our own inventory andinvestments to cover transactions in which we or our clients havesold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured fundingis less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecuredfunding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders.Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our securedfunding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturityprofiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility andcounterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate ourrefinancing risk by executing term trades with staggeredmaturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess securedfunding and pre-funding residual risk through our GCLA.We seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate\nfor the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and weseek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized byasset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis,especially during times of market stress. Our securedfunding, excluding funding collateralized by liquidgovernment and agency obligations, is primarily executedfor tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executedthrough term repurchase agreements and securities loanedcontracts.\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during\ntimes of market stress include certain financial instrumentsin the following categories: mortgage and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-gradecorporate debt securities, equity securities and emergingmarket securities.\nWe also raise financing through other types of\ncollateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes.GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal HomeLoan Bank. Our outstanding borrowings against theFederal Home Loan Bank were $100 million as ofDecember 2021 and we had no outstanding borrowings asof December 2020. Additionally, we have access to fundingthrough the Federal Reserve discount window. However,we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning andstress testing.\nUnsecured Short-Term Borrowings. A significant\nportion of our unsecured short-term borrowings wasoriginally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature withinone year of the reporting date.

This evaluation alsotakes into account our process for identifying risk, ourcontrols and governance for capital planning, and ourguidelines for making capital planning decisions. Inaddition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capitaldistributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases orredemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capitalsecurities) and issue capital, across the range ofmacroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions.The FRB determines the SCB applicable to us based on itsown annual stress test. The SCB under the Standardizedapproach is calculated as (i) the difference between ourstarting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios underthe supervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii) ourplanned common stock dividends for each of the fourththrough seventh quarters of the planning horizon,expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs).\nWe submitted our 2021 CCAR capital plan in April 2021\nand published a summary of our annual DFAST results inJune 2021. See \u201cBusiness \u2014 Available Information\u201d inPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.

See \u201cShare Repurchase Program\u201d forfurther information about common stock repurchases anddividends.\nGS Bank USA has its own capital planning process and,\nstarting in 2022, will be required to submit its annual stresstest results to the FRB. GSI, GSIB and Goldman Sachs BankEurope SE (GSBE) also have their own capital planning andstress testing processes, which incorporate internallydesigned stress tests developed in accordance with theguidelines of their respective regulators.\nContingency Capital Plan. As part of our comprehensive\ncapital management policy, we maintain a contingencycapital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides aframework for analyzing and responding to a perceived oractual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to,identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well asmitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriatecommunication procedures to follow during a crisis period,including internal dissemination of information, as well astimely communication with external stakeholders.Capital Attribution. We assess each of our businesses\u2019\ncapital usage based on our internal assessment of risks,which incorporates an attribution of our relevantregulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capitalrequirements are allocated using our attributed equityframework, which takes into consideration our mostbinding capital constraints. Our most binding capitalconstraint is based on the results of the FRB\u2019s annual stresstest, which includes the Standardized risk-based capital andleverage ratios.\nWe review and make any necessary adjustments to our\nattributed equity in January each year, to reflect, amongother things, the results of our latest CCAR process, as wellas projected changes in our balance sheet. OnJanuary 1, 2021, our allocation of attributed equitychanged (relative to the allocation as of December 2020) asfollows: attributed equity increased by approximately$3.7 billion for Asset Management and approximately$0.7 billion for Consumer & Wealth Management, whileattributed equity decreased by approximately $2.3 billionfor Global Markets and approximately $2.1 billion forInvestment Banking.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the Board of Directors of\nGroup Inc. (Board) approved an increase in our commonstock dividend from $1.25 to $2.00 per share. During thefourth quarter of 2021, we returned a total of $1.20 billionto shareholders, including common stock repurchases of$500 million and approximately $700 million in commonstock dividends. We currently expect our common stockrepurchases in the first quarter of 2022 to be at or aroundthe levels of common stock repurchases in the fourthquarter of 2021. Consistent with our capital managementphilosophy, we will continue prioritizing deployment ofcapital for our clients where returns are attractive andreturn any excess capital to shareholders through dividendsand share repurchases.\nAs of December 2021, the remaining share authorization\nunder our existing repurchase program was 34.4 millionshares.

In connection with our\nresolution planning efforts, we have established aResolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework,which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GSBank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI,GSIB, GSBE, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL),Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and GoldmanSachs Asset Management International) have access tosufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity,subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that theyare able to wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcyfiling in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.\nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts\nframework, which is designed to provide the Board withinformation needed to make an informed decision onwhether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedingsfor Group Inc.\nRating Agency Guidelines\nThe credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to theobligations of Group Inc., which directly issues orguarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debtobligations. GS&Co. and GSI have been assigned long- andshort-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies.GS Bank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been assignedlong- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings ontheir long- and short-term bank deposits. In addition, creditrating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations ofcertain other subsidiaries of Group Inc.The level and composition of our capital are among the\nmany factors considered in determining our credit ratings.Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital andmethodology for evaluating capital adequacy, andassessments are generally based on a combination of factorsrather than a single calculation. See \u201cRisk Management \u2014Liquidity Risk Management \u2014 Credit Ratings\u201d for furtherinformation about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS BankUSA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI.\nConsolidated Regulatory Capital\nWe are subject to consolidated regulatory capitalrequirements which are calculated in accordance with theregulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under theCapital Framework, we are an \u201cAdvanced approach\u201dbanking organization and have been designated as a globalsystemically important bank (G-SIB).\nThe capital requirements calculated under the Capital\nFramework include the capital conservation bufferrequirements, which are comprised of a 2.5% buffer (underthe Advanced Capital Rules), the SCB (under theStandardized Capital Rules), a countercyclical capitalbuffer (under both Capital Rules) and the G-SIB surcharge(under both Capital Rules). Our G-SIB surcharge is 2.5%for 2021 and 2022 and 3.0% for 2023. Based on financialdata for 2021, we are above the threshold for the 3.5%G-SIB surcharge. The earliest this surcharge could beeffective is January 2024. The G-SIB surcharge andcountercyclical capital buffer in the future may differ due toadditional guidance from our regulators and/or positionalchanges, and our SCB is likely to change from year to yearbased on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests.Our target is to maintain capital ratios equal to theregulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basispoints.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4476, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccf40008-d009-49f9-a0ce-96a6bf95cc60": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccf40008-d009-49f9-a0ce-96a6bf95cc60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e914a810-ea7b-4b18-93aa-bb587cf9c8e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5cf1d3554467e269b040de374e21d860f9dcbb0bd5498ad6e27376d9cd9374e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4e77ee6-ebc5-4e6f-b80a-5f246a4fe50d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ddd6a3176ed7d48c1be88ed71732d06803fcf76d90e7d84c95ebfa7eb313a530", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6697fa95-3886-4640-819b-dc634ac8c657", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "53296ac8b944fac1fc0c1f27a8583beaab4b74132b1ff80eec8a8cd671ae5b91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "dec0c72fb6f03456e69251d0b3b0656503353866fddd063395ac1b49e5cb6854", "text": "Our G-SIB surcharge is 2.5%for 2021 and 2022 and 3.0% for 2023.

On January 1, 2022, the publication of\nall EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USD LIBOR)settings along with certain USD LIBOR settings ceased. Thepublication of the most commonly used USD LIBORsettings will cease after June 2023. The FCA has allowedthe publication and use of synthetic rates for certain GBPand JPY LIBOR settings in legacy GBP or JPY LIBOR-based derivative contracts through December 2022. TheU.S. federal banking agencies\u2019 guidance stronglyencourages banking organizations to cease using USDLIBOR.\nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association\n(ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (IBOR Protocol) hasprovided derivatives market participants with amendedfallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts tomitigate legal or economic uncertainty. Both counterpartieshave to adhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in bilateralamendments for the terms to be effective for derivativecontracts. ISDA confirmed that the FCA\u2019s formalannouncement in March 2021 fixed the spread adjustmentfor all LIBOR rates and that fallbacks will automaticallyoccur for outstanding derivative contracts that incorporatethe relevant terms. In April 2021, the State of New Yorkapproved legislation intended to minimize legal andeconomic uncertainty for contracts that are governed byNew York law and have no fallback provisions or havefallback provisions that are based on USD LIBOR byproviding a statutory framework to replace USD LIBORwith a benchmark rate based on the Secured OvernightFinancing Rate (SOFR).\nWe have facilitated an orderly transition from non-USD\nLIBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates for us andour clients and continue to make progress on our transitionprogram as it relates to USD LIBOR.Our non-USD LIBOR risk exposure was substantially all in\nconnection with derivative contracts. As ofDecember 2021, substantially all of our non-USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts were with central clearingcounterparties or exchanges which had incorporatedfallbacks consistent with the IBOR Protocol in theirrulebooks or were under bilateral agreements subject to theIBOR Protocol. The remainder were converted to syntheticrates as permitted by the FCA. The notional amount ofderivatives converted to synthetic rates was not material.\nOur risk exposure to USD LIBOR is primarily in\nconnection with our derivative contracts and to a lesserextent our unsecured debt, preferred stock and loanportfolio. As of December 2021, the notional amount ofour USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts wasapproximately $10.0 trillion, of which approximately$5.5 trillion will mature after June 2023 based on theircontractual terms. A majority of such derivative contractsare with counterparties under bilateral agreements subjectto the IBOR Protocol, or with central clearingcounterparties or exchanges which have incorporatedfallbacks consistent with the IBOR Protocol in theirrulebooks and have announced that they plan to convertUSD LIBOR contracts to alternative risk-free referencerates. Our benchmark unsecured debt and preferred stockwith USD LIBOR exposure was approximately$34.5 billion as of December 2021, of which $29.4 billionwill contractually mature after June 2023 or is perpetualand has no stated maturity date.

Infection rates in many\nparts of the world spiked toward the end of 2021 and intoearly 2022, as the highly transmissible Omicron variantemerged in the fourth quarter and spread rapidly, while theDelta variant also remained a concern. The surge ofinfections has led to a renewed emphasis globally on safetymeasures and restrictions, as well as a greater sense ofurgency regarding the distribution of vaccines and vaccineboosters, and has created a greater degree of uncertaintyregarding the prospects for economic growth in 2022.We have continued to successfully execute on our BCP\nstrategy since initially activating it in the first quarter of2020 in response to the emergence of the COVID-19pandemic. Our priority has been to safeguard ouremployees and to seek to ensure continuity of businessoperations on behalf of our clients. Our business continuityresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic is managed by acentral team, which is led by our chief administrative officerand chief medical officer, and includes senior managementwithin Risk and the chief operating officers across allregions and businesses. We remain focused on ensuring thatour employees are able to safely work from our offices,where circumstances permit. During 2021, we madesubstantial progress in facilitating the safe return ofemployees to our offices and employees in a number of ourlocations around the world returned to the office to varyingdegrees. Given that the situation regarding COVID-19 isfluid and varies geographically, our approach totransitioning back to the office is flexible and evolves as thespecific conditions and requirements of each locationchange. For instance, in light of the rapid spread of theOmicron variant late in 2021, we took the step of havingthe vast majority of employees in the U.S., the U.K. and insome of our other locations work remotely at the outset of2022.\nOur systems and infrastructure have been robust\nthroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling us toconduct our activities without disruption.

We continued to deployour balance sheet to intermediate risk and to support theneeds of clients. We have maintained our proactiveapproach to managing market risk levels, which entailsongoing review and monitoring of exposures and focusingon ways to mitigate risk. As the economic recoveryprogressed in 2021, credit risk continued to abate from thelow point of the pandemic. However, we continue toclosely monitor those industries that have been mostseverely challenged by the pandemic.\nWhile the global economy continued on the path to\nrecovery during 2021, it is vulnerable to the risk that theOmicron variant, or other possible variants, could impedethe recovery going forward by precipitating adverseeconomic consequences, such as a softening in consumerand business confidence and spending, a worsening ofsupply chain constraints, and an intensification ofinflationary pressures. If the future effects of the pandemicwere to lead to a sustained period of economic weakness,our businesses would be negatively impacted. This wouldhave a negative impact on factors that are important to ouroperating performance, such as the level of client activity,creditworthiness of counterparties and borrowers, and theamount of our AUS.

Accordingly, we have established an enterprise riskmanagement framework that employs a comprehensive,integrated approach to risk management, and is designed toenable comprehensive risk management processes throughwhich we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks weassume in conducting our activities. Our risk managementstructure is built around three core components:governance, processes and people.\nGovernance. Risk management governance starts with the\nBoard, which both directly and through its committees,including its Risk Committee, oversees our riskmanagement policies and practices implemented throughthe enterprise risk management framework. The Board isalso responsible for the annual review and approval of ourrisk appetite statement. The risk appetite statementdescribes the levels and types of risk we are willing to acceptor to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included inour strategic business plan, while remaining in compliancewith regulatory requirements. The Board reviews ourstrategic business plan and is ultimately responsible foroverseeing and providing direction about our strategy andrisk appetite.The Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks,\nincluding liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operationalrisk and model risk, from our independent risk oversightand control functions, including the chief risk officer, andon compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, onlegal and regulatory enforcement matters from the chieflegal officer, and on other matters impacting our reputationfrom the chair of our Firmwide Client and BusinessStandards Committee and our Firmwide Reputational RiskCommittee. The chief risk officer reports to our chiefexecutive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board.As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, thechief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee ofthe Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures,including risk limits and thresholds established in our riskappetite statement.\nThe implementation of our risk governance structure and\ncore risk management processes are overseen by EnterpriseRisk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and isresponsible for ensuring that our enterprise riskmanagement framework provides the Board, our riskcommittees and senior management with a consistent andintegrated approach to managing our various risks in amanner consistent with our risk appetite.\nOur revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury,\nEngineering, Human Capital Management, Operations,and Corporate and Workplace Solutions, are consideredour first line of defense. They are accountable for theoutcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as forassessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite.\nOur independent risk oversight and control functions are\nconsidered our second line of defense and provideindependent assessment, oversight and challenge of therisks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead andparticipate in risk committees. Independent risk oversightand control functions include Compliance, ConflictsResolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk and Tax.\nInternal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and\nour director of Internal Audit reports to the AuditCommittee of the Board and administratively to our chiefexecutive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals witha broad range of audit and industry experience, includingrisk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible forindependently assessing and validating the effectiveness ofkey controls, including those within the risk managementframework, and providing timely reporting to the AuditCommittee of the Board, senior management andregulators.\n90 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4688, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f66f3cc-44ca-447e-a07e-2d499ea20e57": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f66f3cc-44ca-447e-a07e-2d499ea20e57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42d5a2c3-f370-4ace-b496-b49743355022", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "bb84763f32f37faa61622e7cc5af7db0307b0212cfc1172143f266272eb532e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1142183e-f2af-46a4-ae12-0329613f296a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ebe4810d5e81d269c3af7d8eb9e6b8ed22bb9ff976e3321f978acf531812286b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "40267a07-cc76-417c-a0bf-2a73d78248ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aa35275efb69d0863bc1bf5b420b949f756fee71bd079a35d658d4c259db41b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6b461e2582b59277635530539ed340df8cab4c3de8cbb655c9fe0b8001ec0d6c", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nThe three lines of defense structure promotes the\naccountability of first line risk takers, provides aframework for effective challenge by the second line andempowers independent review from the third line.\nProcesses. We maintain various processes that are critical\ncomponents of our risk management framework, including(i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limitand threshold setting, (iii) risk reporting and monitoring,and (iv) risk decision-making.\n\u2030Risk Identification and Assessment. We believe that\nthe identification and assessment of our risks is a criticalstep in providing our Board and senior managementtransparency and insight into the range and materiality ofour risks. We have a comprehensive data collectionprocess, including firmwide policies and procedures thatrequire all employees to report and escalate risk events.Our approach for risk identification and assessment iscomprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic andforward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing riskprofile and business environment, leverages subjectmatter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our mostcritical risks.\nTo effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily\ndiscipline of marking substantially all of our inventory tocurrent market levels. We carry our inventory at fairvalue, with changes in valuation reflected immediately inour risk management systems and in net revenues. We doso because we believe this discipline is one of the mosteffective tools for assessing and managing risk and that itprovides transparent and realistic insight into ourinventory exposures.\nAn important part of our risk management process is\nfirmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify ourexposure to tail risks, highlight potential lossconcentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, andassess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stresstests are performed on a regular basis and are designed toensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilitiesand idiosyncratic risks combining financial andnonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit,market, liquidity and funding, operational andcompliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into asingle combined scenario. We also perform ad hoc stresstests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stresstests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part ofour capital planning and stress testing process. See\u201cCapital Management and Regulatory Capital \u2014 CapitalManagement\u201d for further information.\u2030Risk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting. We apply\na rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to controland monitor risk across transactions, products,businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectlythrough its Risk Committee, approves limits andthresholds included in our risk appetite statement atfirmwide, business and product levels. In addition, theFirmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible forapproving our risk limits framework, subject to theoverall limits approved by the Risk Committee of theBoard, and monitoring these limits.\nThe Risk Governance Committee is responsible for\napproving limits at firmwide, business and product levels.Certain limits may be set at levels that will requireperiodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect ourmaximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogueabout risk among our first and second lines of defense,committees and senior management, as well as rapidescalation of risk-related matters. Additionally, throughdelegated authority from the Risk GovernanceCommittee, Market Risk sets limits at certain productand desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individualcounterparties, counterparties and their subsidiaries,industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularlyand amended on a permanent or temporary basis toreflect changing market conditions, business conditionsor risk tolerance.\n\u2030Risk Reporting and Monitoring. Effective risk\nreporting and risk decision-making depends on ourability to get the right information to the right people atthe right time. As such, we focus on the rigor andeffectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective ofensuring that our risk management technology systemsprovide us with complete, accurate and timelyinformation. Our risk reporting and monitoring processesare designed to take into account information about bothexisting and emerging risks, thereby enabling our riskcommittees and senior management to perform theirresponsibilities with the appropriate level of insight intorisk exposures. Furthermore, our limit and thresholdbreach processes provide means for timely escalation. Weevaluate changes in our risk profile and our businesses,including changes in business mix or jurisdictions inwhich we operate, by monitoring risk factors at afirmwide level.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 91", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4913, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40267a07-cc76-417c-a0bf-2a73d78248ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "40267a07-cc76-417c-a0bf-2a73d78248ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "702ceb06-d8bd-46c2-816b-3d1ef5423fb0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0e7714970db6ca797773c6e3a7c9accf78fb3e988acc17b8c8daacf8bbb0818d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f66f3cc-44ca-447e-a07e-2d499ea20e57", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6b461e2582b59277635530539ed340df8cab4c3de8cbb655c9fe0b8001ec0d6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5362fa5-87cd-430a-b028-d36c087a75a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e4d9cdb3cb25c4cb8998a258963dcc10b782597855743333c107ef5045f20a83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "aa35275efb69d0863bc1bf5b420b949f756fee71bd079a35d658d4c259db41b0", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Compliance risk is inherent in allactivities through which we conduct our businesses. OurCompliance Risk Management Program, administered byCompliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory andreputational risk; monitors for compliance with new oramended laws, rules and regulations; designs andimplements controls, policies, procedures and training;conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils andmonitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads ourresponses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries.We monitor and review business practices to assess whetherthey meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legalstandards in all markets and jurisdictions in which weconduct business.\nCapital Risk Management\nCapital risk is the risk that our capital is insufficient tosupport our business activities under normal and stressedmarket conditions or we face capital reductions or RWAincreases, including from new or revised rules or changes ininterpretations of existing rules, and are therefore unable tomeet our internal capital targets or external regulatorycapital requirements. Capital adequacy is of criticalimportance to us. Accordingly, we have in place acomprehensive capital management policy that provides aframework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines tomaintain an appropriate level and composition of capital inboth business-as-usual and stressed conditions.

Our principal objective is tobe able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businessesto continue to serve clients and generate revenues, evenunder adverse circumstances.\nTreasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has\nprimary responsibility for developing, managing andexecuting our liquidity and funding strategy within our riskappetite.\nLiquidity Risk, which is independent of our revenue-\nproducing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief riskofficer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoringand managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversightacross our global businesses and the establishment of stresstesting and limits frameworks.Liquidity Risk Management Principles\nWe manage liquidity risk according to three principles:(i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA tocover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintainappropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintaina viable Contingency Funding Plan.\nGCLA. GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad\nrange of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in astressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is topre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needsduring a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form ofunencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believethat the securities held in our GCLA would be readilyconvertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation,by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities ofresale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meetimmediate obligations without needing to sell other assets ordepend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.\nOur GCLA reflects the following principles:\u2030The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most\ncritical to a company\u2019s survival;\n\u2030Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and\ncollateral outflows, not just disruptions to financingflows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needsare determined by many factors, including marketmovements, collateral requirements and clientcommitments, all of which can change dramatically in adifficult funding environment;\n\u2030During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding,\nincluding unsecured debt, certain deposits and some typesof secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, andthe terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions andtenor) or availability of other types of secured financingmay change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and\n\u2030As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we\nestimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold moreunencumbered securities and have larger fundingbalances than our businesses would otherwise require.We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greaterbalances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, eventhough it increases our total assets and our funding costs.\nWe maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs\nFunding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.\u2019s majorbroker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types andclearing agents to provide us with sufficient operatingliquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets,even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to theGCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in severalof our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies,entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediateaccess to parent company liquidity.\n96 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5117, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "166dc2c1-e1a2-41b2-920a-b519c33dadae": {"__data__": {"id_": "166dc2c1-e1a2-41b2-920a-b519c33dadae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bbc6ad65-2d49-4090-b0b8-9f6fad6cfa34", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1fdc17f57077b90ee8b41ebbc1ea7cf6c309cf5158cb0ca4a97b262ee09b8f62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd03dec5-cfba-43fe-979e-0ce093fd3f4d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0775f4d94e697ec8357c9add20bdeb324afbdd9613969a0bb459c243ef914535", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7fff41ad-6d77-4a10-afde-486aedf6cbfa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1a38bddceba34b033e9c16f805a2dc7a0586a8772a1903c3a260d7c233e98f8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8f6932d79272de900fb97293cc5e8e3395fc02c13fa95bbb3b6e339f31e69b2a", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nAsset-Liability Management. Our liquidity risk\nmanagement policies are designed to ensure we have asufficient amount of financing, even when funding marketsexperience persistent stress. We manage the maturities anddiversity of our funding across markets, products andcounterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified fundingprofile with an appropriate tenor, taking into considerationthe characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.\nOur approach to asset-liability management includes:\u2030Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of\nour funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term,diversified sources of funding in excess of our currentrequirements. See \u201cBalance Sheet and Funding Sources \u2014Funding Sources\u201d for further information;\n\u2030Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with\nparticular focus on the liquidity, holding period andability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess ourfunding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets ina stressed environment while appropriately managingrisk. This enables us to determine the most appropriatefunding products and tenors. See \u201cBalance Sheet andFunding Sources \u2014 Balance Sheet Management\u201d forfurther information about our balance sheet managementprocess and \u201c\u2014 Funding Sources \u2014 Secured Funding\u201dfor further information about asset classes that may beharder to fund on a secured basis; and\n\u2030Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long\ntenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. Thisreduces the risk that our liabilities will come due inadvance of our ability to generate liquidity from the saleof our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balancesheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may bematerially shorter than their contractual maturity dates.\nOur goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to\nfund our assets and meet our contractual and contingentobligations in normal times, as well as during periods ofmarket stress. Through our dynamic balance sheetmanagement process, we use actual and projected assetbalances to determine secured and unsecured fundingrequirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved bythe Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, ourindependent risk oversight and control functions analyze,and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, ourconsolidated total capital position (unsecured long-termborrowings plus total shareholders\u2019 equity) so that wemaintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient tomeet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquiditycrisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoidreliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, werecognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent ornecessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.Subsidiary Funding Policies\nThe majority of our unsecured funding is raised by GroupInc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHCand other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meettheir asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. Inaddition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiarieswith the necessary capital to meet their regulatoryrequirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiaryfunding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meetthe funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding isalso raised at the subsidiary level through a variety ofproducts, including deposits, secured funding andunsecured borrowings.\nOur intercompany funding policies assume that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s funds or securities are not freely available to itsparent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legallyprovided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, taxor other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiariesare subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to blockor reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries toGroup Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kindcould impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to makepayments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume thatthe capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is notavailable to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any otherfinancing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is notavailable to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturityof such financing.\nGroup Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and\nsubordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to itsregulated subsidiaries.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nContingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency\nfunding plan to provide a framework for analyzing andresponding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods ofmarket stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a listof potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that arereviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing theseverity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/ormarket dislocation. The contingency funding plan alsodescribes in detail our potential responses if ourassessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis,which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be ourpotential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizingsecondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action itemsto address specific risks which may arise are also describedand assigned to individuals responsible for execution.\nThe contingency funding plan identifies key groups ofindividuals and their responsibilities, which include fosteringeffective coordination, control and distribution of information,implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managinginternal and external communication, all of which are criticalin the management of a crisis or period of market stress.\nStress TestsIn order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, wemodel liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and timehorizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models,referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies ourliquidity risks over a 30-day stress scenario. We also considerother factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment ofour potential intraday liquidity needs through an additionalinternal liquidity risk model, referred to as the IntradayLiquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testingmodels, our resolution liquidity models and other applicableregulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of ourcondition, as well as the financial markets. The results of theModeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model,the long-term stress testing models and the resolutionliquidity models are reported to senior management on aregular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See\u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d forinformation about firmwide stress tests.\nModeled Liquidity Outflow. Our Modeled Liquidity\nOutflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios thatinclude combinations of market-wide and firm-specificstress. These scenarios are characterized by the followingqualitative elements:\n\u2030Severely challenged market environments, which includes\nlow consumer and corporate confidence, financial andpolitical instability, and adverse changes in market values,including potential declines in equity markets andwidening of credit spreads; and\n\u2030A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses,\nreputational damage, litigation and/or a ratings downgrade.The following are key modeling elements of our Modeled\nLiquidity Outflow:\n\u2030Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario;\n\u2030A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior\nunsecured credit ratings;\n\u2030Changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our\naccess to unsecured and secured funding;\n\u2030No support from additional government funding\nfacilities. Although we have access to various central bankfunding programs, we do not assume reliance onadditional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and\n\u2030A combination of contractual outflows and contingent\noutflows arising from both our on- and off-balance sheetarrangements. Contractual outflows include, amongother things, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt,term deposits and secured funding. Contingent outflowsinclude, among other things, the withdrawal of customercredit balances in our prime brokerage business, increasein variation margin requirements due to adverse changesin the value of our exchange-traded and OTC-clearedderivatives, draws on unfunded commitments andwithdrawals of deposits that have no contractualmaturity. See notes to the consolidated financialstatements for further information about contractualoutflows, including Note 11 for collateralized financings,Note 13 for deposits, Note 14 for unsecured long-termborrowings and Note 15 for operating lease payments,and \u201cOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d for furtherinformation about our various types of off-balance sheetarrangements.\nIntraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday Liquidity Model\nmeasures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenarioanalysis characterized by the same qualitative elements asour Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses therisk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during ascenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity maybecome constrained.\nLong-Term Stress Testing.

We hold such positions primarily for marketmaking for our clients and for our investing and financingactivities, and therefore, these positions change based onclient demands and our investment opportunities. Sincethese positions are accounted for at fair value, theyfluctuate on a daily basis, with the related gains and lossesincluded in the consolidated statements of earnings. Weemploy a variety of risk measures, each described in therespective sections below, to monitor market risk.Categories of market risk include the following:\n\u2030Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the\nlevel, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilitiesof interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;\u2030Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in\nprices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets ofequities and equity indices;\n\u2030Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in\nspot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currencyrates; and\n\u2030Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes\nin spot prices, forward prices and volatilities ofcommodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products,natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals.\nMarket Risk, which is independent of our revenue-\nproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer, hasprimary responsibility for assessing, monitoring andmanaging our market risk through firmwide oversightacross our global businesses.\nManagers in revenue-producing units and Market Risk\ndiscuss market information, positions and estimated lossscenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenue-producing units are accountable for managing risk withinprescribed limits. These managers have in-depth knowledgeof their positions, markets and the instruments available tohedge their exposures.\nMarket Risk Management Process\nOur process for managing market risk includes the criticalcomponents of our risk management framework describedin the \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management,\u201d aswell as the following:\n\u2030Monitoring compliance with established market risk\nlimits and reporting our exposures;\n\u2030Diversifying exposures;\n\u2030Controlling position sizes; and\n\u2030Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related\nsecurities or derivatives.\nOur market risk management systems enable us to perform\nan independent calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) andstress measures, capture risk measures at individualposition levels, attribute risk measures to individual riskfactors of each position, report many different views of therisk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type orentity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.\n102 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4870, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b66fafd5-2d87-441f-8472-9c7b83925f89": {"__data__": {"id_": "b66fafd5-2d87-441f-8472-9c7b83925f89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52d6317a-75f2-42d7-8676-e5f9405b7c05", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "cd77246aae2837fd63c0adf29f4cce1ec44bd053c8a4e69aa41561bafe7f8f32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b942fe92-ed57-47c0-bb37-b0c2f52655a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2f7f919f06119d89e2bbe80c8a88e397b860404d02dcbd6465cda763e8b97985", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "97d54a56-a286-4ea4-be45-5ee4d9e22dfb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d215369cc89b40a6230eea9e8bf3789a0e58b8d6877fb1b489edd36e11fe280", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ec4ea02c94a90fa65124df8061540145116c3d8130c0206ff75fbcf19b685666", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nRisk Measures\nWe produce risk measures and monitor them againstestablished market risk limits. These measures reflect anextensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregatedat product, business and firmwide levels.\nWe use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of\npotential losses for both moderate and more extrememarket moves over both short- and long-term timehorizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, which isused for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. Our riskreports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each deskand business, and are distributed daily to seniormanagement of both our revenue-producing units and ourindependent risk oversight and control functions.\nValue-at-Risk. VaR is the potential loss in value due to\nadverse market movements over a defined time horizonwith a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilitiesincluded in VaR, see \u201cFinancial Statement Linkages toMarket Risk Measures.\u201d We typically employ a one-daytime horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a singleVaR model, which captures risks, including interest rates,equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. Assuch, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios ofdifferent risk characteristics. VaR also captures thediversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.\nWe are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and\ntherefore use a variety of risk measures in our market riskmanagement process. Inherent limitations to VaR include:\n\u2030VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time\nhorizons where moves may be extreme;\n\u2030VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of\ndifferent risk positions; and\n\u2030Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce\naccurate predictions of all future market moves.\nTo comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant\nrisks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulationswith full valuation of market factors at the position level bysimultaneously shocking the relevant market factors forthat position. These market factors include spot prices,credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility andcorrelation, and are updated periodically based on changesin the composition of positions, as well as variations inmarket conditions. We sample from five years of historicaldata to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. Thehistorical data is weighted so that the relative importance ofthe data reduces over time. This gives greater importance tomore recent observations and reflects current assetvolatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates ofpotential loss. As a result, even if our positions included inVaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase withincreasing market volatility and vice versa.Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in\nestimating risk exposures in markets in which there are nosudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.\nOur VaR measure does not include:\u2030Positions that are best measured and monitored using\nsensitivity measures; and\n\u2030The impact of changes in counterparty and our own\ncredit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in ourown credit spreads on financial liabilities for which thefair value option was elected.\nWe perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e.,\ncomparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaRto the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day)at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses andmajor regulated subsidiaries.\nStress Testing. Stress testing is a method of determining\nthe effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We usestress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as wellas the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. Weuse a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate thepotential loss from a wide range of market moves on ourportfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivityanalysis and scenario analysis. The results of our variousstress tests are analyzed together for risk managementpurposes. See \u201cOverview and Structure of RiskManagement\u201d for information about firmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a\nmarket move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g.,equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of definedmarket shocks, ranging from those that could be expectedover a one-day time horizon up to those that could takemany months to occur.

Instead, stress testing is used tomodel both moderate and more extreme moves inunderlying market factors. When estimating potential loss,we generally assume that our positions cannot be reducedor hedged (although experience demonstrates that we aregenerally able to do so).\nLimits\nWe use market risk limits at various levels to manage thesize of our market exposures.

Ourexposure to credit risk comes mostly from clienttransactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lendingcommitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed withbanks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale andrepurchase agreements and securities borrowing andlending activities) and customer and other receivables.Credit Risk, which is independent of our revenue-\nproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer, hasprimary responsibility for assessing, monitoring andmanaging our credit risk through firmwide oversight acrossour global businesses. In addition, we hold other positionsthat give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bankloans). These credit risks are captured as a component ofmarket risk measures, which are monitored and managedby Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to managemarket risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise tocredit risk, which is monitored and managed by CreditRisk.\nCredit Risk Management Process\nOur process for managing credit risk includes the criticalcomponents of our risk management framework describedin the \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management,\u201d aswell as the following:\n\u2030Monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits\nand reporting our credit exposures and creditconcentrations;\n\u2030Establishing or approving underwriting standards;\n\u2030Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default\non its payment obligations;\n\u2030Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and\nlosses resulting from a counterparty default;\n\u2030Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and\nhedging; and\n\u2030Maximizing recovery through active workout and\nrestructuring of claims.\nWe also perform credit reviews, which include initial and\nongoing analyses of our counterparties. For substantially allof our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annualcounterparty credit review. A credit review is anindependent analysis of the capacity and willingness of acounterparty to meet its financial obligations, resulting inan internal credit rating. The determination of internalcredit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect tothe nature of and outlook for the counterparty\u2019s industry,and the economic environment. Senior personnel, withexpertise in specific industries, inspect and approve creditreviews and internal credit ratings.\nOur risk assessment process may also include, where\napplicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but notlimited to, delinquency status, collateral values, FICOcredit scores and other risk factors.\n106 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4314, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4196d5d9-7944-486d-b1a5-9c985d350e14": {"__data__": {"id_": "4196d5d9-7944-486d-b1a5-9c985d350e14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f8ffe91-cd03-4c73-84cb-88d708bae8c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3f0dc45c5c2550adb0bf550f868a35dd093b47536ec021aa2573017ba4b4994b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "008a6dec-a510-467d-a8d4-243b3df3c9f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "7d6dd378c27b02442adbcdda795e92cc015597633757ddf6ebb2a668ed7b3f9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e281f826-bd09-4dac-b4ad-333af91a4b54", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f2b1d1809beff378106a37d62bda2bf7dc8d3b6e1a14d9e50a380bd633336cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b691a049bf90b64cd76856c97600018c196fae4688d547f00100d1376ae1a31e", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nOur credit risk management systems capture credit\nexposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregatebasis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. These systemsalso provide management with comprehensive informationabout our aggregate credit risk by product, internal creditrating, industry, country and region.\nRisk Measures\nWe measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in theevent of non-payment by a counterparty using current andpotential exposure. For derivatives and securities financingtransactions, current exposure represents the amountpresently owed to us after taking into account applicablenetting and collateral arrangements, while potentialexposure represents our estimate of the future exposurethat could arise over the life of a transaction based onmarket movements within a specified confidence level.Potential exposure also takes into account netting andcollateral arrangements. For loans and lendingcommitments, the primary measure is a function of thenotional amount of the position.\nStress Tests\nWe conduct regular stress tests to calculate the creditexposures, including potential concentrations that wouldresult from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratingsor credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates,equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderateand more extreme market movements, including shocks tomultiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of asevere market or economic event. In the case of sovereigndefault, we estimate the direct impact of the default on oursovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposuresarising from potential market moves in response to thedefault, and the impact of credit market deterioration oncorporate borrowers and counterparties that may resultfrom the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure,which is calculated within a specified confidence level,stress testing does not generally assume a probability ofthese events occurring. We also perform firmwide stresstests. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management\u201dfor information about firmwide stress tests.\nTo supplement these regular stress tests, as described above,\nwe also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis inresponse to specific market events that we deem significant.We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirectimpact of certain hypothetical events on our countryexposures, such as the impact of credit market deteriorationon corporate borrowers and counterparties along with theshocks to the risk factors described above. The parametersof these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in eachstress test. We review estimated losses produced by thestress tests in order to understand their magnitude,highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess andmitigate our exposures where necessary.Limits\nWe use credit risk limits at various levels, as well asunderwriting standards to manage the size and nature ofour credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries arebased on our risk appetite and are designed to allow forregular monitoring, review, escalation and management ofcredit risk concentrations. See \u201cOverview and Structure ofRisk Management\u201d for information about the limitapproval process.\nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and\nidentifying and escalating to senior management and/or theappropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instanceswhere limits have been exceeded.\nRisk Mitigants\nTo reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securitiesfinancing transactions, we may enter into nettingagreements with counterparties that permit us to offsetreceivables and payables with such counterparties. We mayalso reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering intoagreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them onan upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminatetransactions if the counterparty\u2019s credit rating falls below aspecified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral toensure that our credit exposures are appropriatelycollateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where thereis a significant positive correlation between thecreditworthiness of our counterparties and the marketvalue of collateral we receive.\nFor loans and lending commitments, depending on the\ncredit quality of the borrower and other characteristics ofthe transaction, we employ a variety of potential riskmitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions,guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loanclaims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions inthe legal documentation that allow us to adjust loanamounts, pricing, structure and other terms as marketconditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigantsemployed can significantly influence the degree of creditrisk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into a\ncounterparty\u2019s financial strength or when we believe acounterparty requires support from its parent, we mayobtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty\u2019sobligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk usingcredit derivatives or participation agreements.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 107", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5249, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e281f826-bd09-4dac-b4ad-333af91a4b54": {"__data__": {"id_": "e281f826-bd09-4dac-b4ad-333af91a4b54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6e130fe2-b5f7-4530-bbab-3b583c0432d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b136daa182702763658563166e324c30e77db0f85cbc3a2ce9851bda52ff0842", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4196d5d9-7944-486d-b1a5-9c985d350e14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b691a049bf90b64cd76856c97600018c196fae4688d547f00100d1376ae1a31e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a85e9b0f-616e-4aff-abea-5502e5cff0c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "36ce990f2e04e7fe4d97c9ae0e6a45d7f1eb3b59537779bb59e50cae13fc0be5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4f2b1d1809beff378106a37d62bda2bf7dc8d3b6e1a14d9e50a380bd633336cb", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

CVA is a function of thepresent value of expected exposure, the probability ofcounterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.\nThe table below presents our net credit exposure from OTC\nderivatives and the concentration by industry and region.\nAs of December\n$ in millions 2021 2020\nOTC derivative assets $ 58,637 $ 64,850\nCollateral (not netted under U.S. GAAP) (17,245) (18,990)\nNet credit exposure $ 41,392 $ 45,860\nIndustry\nConsumer & Retail 2% 4%\nDiversified Industrials 10% 23%\nFinancial Institutions 15% 12%\nFunds 13% 12%\nHealthcare 1% 2%\nMunicipalities & Nonprofit 5% 6%\nNatural Resources & Utilities 33% 11%\nSovereign 8% 14%\nTechnology, Media & Telecommunications 8% 12%\nOther (including Special Purpose Vehicles) 5% 4%\nTotal 100% 100%\nRegion\nAmericas 53% 62%\nEMEA 37% 30%\nAsia 10% 8%\nTotal 100% 100%\nOur credit exposure (before any potential recoveries) to\nOTC derivative counterparties that defaulted during 2021remained low, representing less than 2% of our total creditexposure from OTC derivatives.\nIn the table above:\u2030OTC derivative assets, included in the consolidated\nbalance sheets, are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis(i.e., the net receivable for a given counterparty) when alegal right of setoff exists under an enforceable nettingagreement (counterparty netting) and are accounted for atfair value, net of cash collateral received under enforceablecredit support agreements (cash collateral netting).\n\u2030Collateral represents cash collateral and the fair value of\nsecurities collateral, primarily U.S. and non-U.S.government and agency obligations, received under creditsupport agreements, that we consider when determiningcredit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for nettingunder U.S. GAAP.\n108 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4202, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a85e9b0f-616e-4aff-abea-5502e5cff0c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a85e9b0f-616e-4aff-abea-5502e5cff0c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d1e5c442-92ff-46b1-a292-f1aa391d4955", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4dfbf85d0bf02cff8daf90ac5938aba10a9602ed2e710b6363eed6c28d642f2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e281f826-bd09-4dac-b4ad-333af91a4b54", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4f2b1d1809beff378106a37d62bda2bf7dc8d3b6e1a14d9e50a380bd633336cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ace4cb8b-a8ba-481c-8d9a-833928b263ba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb70f761c9de1530ba7b358891dc14f49bf83200d27bb0c3a783602f9c362eea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "36ce990f2e04e7fe4d97c9ae0e6a45d7f1eb3b59537779bb59e50cae13fc0be5", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

From a top-downperspective, our senior management assesses firmwide andbusiness-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-upperspective, our first and second lines of defense areresponsible for risk identification and risk management ona day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risksand risk events to senior management.\nWe maintain a comprehensive control framework designed\nto provide a well-controlled environment to minimizeoperational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk andResilience Committee is responsible for overseeingoperational risk, and for ensuring our business andoperational resilience.\nOur operational risk management framework is designed to\ncomply with the operational risk measurement rules underthe Capital Framework and has evolved based on thechanging needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance.\nWe have established policies that require all employees to\nreport and escalate operational risk events. Whenoperational risk events are identified, our policies requirethat the events be documented and analyzed to determinewhether changes are required in our systems and/orprocesses to further mitigate the risk of future events.\nWe use operational risk management applications to\ncapture, analyze, aggregate and report operational riskevent data and key metrics. One of our key riskidentification and assessment tools is an operational riskand control self-assessment process, which is performed byour managers. This process consists of the identificationand rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis,and the related controls. The results from this process areanalyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures andidentify businesses, activities or products with heightenedlevels of operational risk.Risk Measurement\nWe measure our operational risk exposure using bothstatistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involvequalitative and quantitative assessments of internal andexternal operational risk event data and internal controlfactors for each of our businesses. Operational riskmeasurement also incorporates an assessment of businessenvironment factors, including:\n\u2030Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities;\n\u2030The degree of automation in our processes;\n\u2030New activity information;\n\u2030The legal and regulatory environment; and\n\u2030Changes in the markets for our products and services,\nincluding the diversity and sophistication of ourcustomers and counterparties.\nThe results from these scenario analyses are used to\nmonitor changes in operational risk and to determinebusiness lines that may have heightened exposure tooperational risk. These analyses are used in thedetermination of the appropriate level of operational riskcapital to hold. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See\u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d forinformation about firmwide stress tests.\nTypes of Operational Risks\nIncreased reliance on technology and third-partyrelationships has resulted in increased operational risks,such as information and cyber security risk, third-party riskand business resilience risk. We manage those risks asfollows:\nInformation and Cyber Security Risk. Information and\ncyber security risk is the risk of compromising theconfidentiality, integrity or availability of our data andsystems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation,our clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek tominimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorizedaccess, disruption or use of information and/or informationsystems. We deploy and operate preventive and detectivecontrols and processes to mitigate emerging and evolvinginformation security and cyber security threats, includingmonitoring our network for known vulnerabilities andsigns of unauthorized attempts to access our data andsystems. There is increased information risk throughdiversification of our data across external service providers,including use of a variety of cloud-provided or -hostedservices and applications.

We rely on quantitativemodels across our business activities primarily to valuecertain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor andmanage our risk, and to measure and monitor ourregulatory capital.\nModel Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producingunits, model developers, model owners and model users, andreports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility forassessing, monitoring and managing our model risk throughfirmwide oversight across our global businesses, andprovides periodic updates to senior management, riskcommittees and the Risk Committee of the Board.Our model risk management framework is managed\nthrough a governance structure and risk managementcontrols, which encompass standards designed to ensure wemaintain a comprehensive model inventory, including riskassessment and classification, sound model developmentpractices, independent review and model-specific usagecontrols. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committeeoversees our model risk management framework.\nModel Review and Validation Process\nModel Risk consists of quantitative professionals whoperform an independent review, validation and approval ofour models. This review includes an analysis of the modeldocumentation, independent testing, an assessment of theappropriateness of the methodology used, and verificationof compliance with model development andimplementation standards.\nWe regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect\nchanges in market or economic conditions and our businessmix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and newmodels or significant changes to existing models and theirassumptions are approved prior to implementation.\nThe model validation process incorporates a review of\nmodels and trade and risk parameters across a broad rangeof scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order tocritically evaluate and verify:\n\u2030The model\u2019s conceptual soundness, including the\nreasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability forintended use;\n\u2030The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to\nensure that the models function as intended;\n\u2030The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated\nin the model;\n\u2030The model\u2019s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of\nthe related product and its significant risks;\n\u2030The model\u2019s consistency with models for similar\nproducts; and\n\u2030The model\u2019s sensitivity to input parameters and\nassumptions.\nSee \u201cCritical Accounting Policies \u2014 Fair Value \u2014 Review\nof Valuation Models,\u201d \u201cLiquidity Risk Management,\u201d\u201cMarket Risk Management,\u201d \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201dand \u201cOperational Risk Management\u201d for furtherinformation about our use of models within these areas.\n116 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4923, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9091dfbf-14cb-44a2-a7ec-440adf1b4970": {"__data__": {"id_": "9091dfbf-14cb-44a2-a7ec-440adf1b4970", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ace4032a-b8ac-4cce-af01-bf6ba94d87d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "460e1206b8ba2cbc9b29478d571a4ea9ee82a2b041d8821badae0b34d2507806", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "adb7e35e-3555-4629-b672-21af93f8243c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "bd6ff17109eb99d589c00d9bdd8bff0f4f210dd62db9b89edadcc029934abdcf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7975f47-3aa7-4ffe-803f-3620b1c3dea0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3b52108f9bedcc5faf2719c761a0fbce31d0a406cd8e471febd8cedd8d4220b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "39a54ca0da7c43e569f8ed68632eb77e2f6f4ebcd6a8b385698229e559fd31f4", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The procedures also involved the use ofprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assistin evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the model andmethodology and (ii) the reasonableness of the internalcredit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment ratesused in estimating the allowance for loan losses for thewholesale loan portfolio.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPNew York, New York\nFebruary 24, 2022\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1922.\n120 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3445, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42198636-0b3e-4f3c-906d-a3f16ca88a71": {"__data__": {"id_": "42198636-0b3e-4f3c-906d-a3f16ca88a71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65aa8868-006a-4895-b3ec-8397d8db0d83", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c62269f261d9ec9bd8d0891c31f962651e15f3b6b0fe22e755191b6da7ff679d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae1c1680-7d57-4fce-b2ed-b9d55cdf9491", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "961ad8e5dec622b554a8639f6a712f6ba1f9518512ef7a9439c1c599647073db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c82a4ea-d297-41f9-8365-3413386715d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6ab85140d3d69e4664598d55f0e3a04a2a90b788a590bd0746ef55330c5e33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "65d516cfe15efe653cf20bd2801902065a281d07608077b9d0fb90056c7eb357", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See Note 4 for policies onfair value measurements, Note 9 for policies on theallowance for credit losses, and below and Note 17 forpolicies on consolidation accounting.

The firm determines whetherit has a controlling financial interest in an entity by firstevaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or avariable interest entity (VIE).\nVoting Interest Entities. Voting interest entities are\nentities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk issufficient to enable the entity to finance its activitiesindependently and (ii) the equity holders have the power todirect the activities of the entity that most significantlyimpact its economic performance, the obligation to absorbthe losses of the entity and the right to receive the residualreturns of the entity. The usual condition for a controllingfinancial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of amajority voting interest. If the firm has a controllingmajority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entityis consolidated.\nVariable Interest Entities. A VIE is an entity that lacks\none or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE whenthe firm has a variable interest or interests that provide itwith (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE thatmost significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performanceand (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or theright to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentiallybe significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for furtherinformation about VIEs.\nEquity-Method Investments. When the firm does not\nhave a controlling financial interest in an entity but canexert significant influence over the entity\u2019s operating andfinancial policies, the investment is generally accounted forat fair value by electing the fair value option available underU.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when thefirm owns 20% to 50% of the entity\u2019s common stock orin-substance common stock.\nIn certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of\naccounting to new investments that are strategic in natureor closely related to the firm\u2019s principal business activities,when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in thecash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed investment funds\nwith third-party investors. These funds are typicallyorganized as limited partnerships or limited liabilitycompanies for which the firm acts as general partner ormanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority ofthe economic interests in these funds. These funds areusually voting interest entities and generally are notconsolidated because third-party investors typically haverights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm asgeneral partner or manager. Investments in these funds aregenerally measured at net asset value (NAV) and areincluded in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for furtherinformation about investments in funds.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of these consolidated financial statementsrequires management to make certain estimates andassumptions, the most important of which relate to fairvalue measurements, the allowance for credit losses onloans and lending commitments accounted for at amortizedcost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangibleassets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigationand regulatory proceedings (including governmentalinvestigations), and accounting for income taxes. Theseestimates and assumptions are based on the best availableinformation but actual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value. Trading\nassets and liabilities and certain investments are carried atfair value either under the fair value option or in accordancewith other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected toaccount for certain of its loans and other financial assetsand liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option.The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount thatwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer aliability in an orderly transaction between marketparticipants at the measurement date. Financial assets aremarked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked tooffer prices. Fair value measurements do not includetransaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generallyincluded in market making or other principal transactions.See Note 4 for further information about fair valuemeasurements.Revenue from Contracts with Clients. The firm\nrecognizes revenue earned from contracts with clients forservices, such as investment banking, investmentmanagement, and execution and clearing (contracts withclients), when the performance obligations related to theunderlying transaction are completed.\nRevenues from contracts with clients represent\napproximately 45% of total non-interest revenues for both2021 and 2020 (including approximately 90% ofinvestment banking revenues, approximately 95% ofinvestment management revenues and all commissions andfees), and approximately 45% of total non-interestrevenues for 2019 (including approximately 85% ofinvestment banking revenues, approximately 95% ofinvestment management revenues and all commissions andfees). See Note 25 for information about net revenues bybusiness segment.\nInvestment Banking\nAdvisory. Fees from financial advisory assignments are\nrecognized in revenues when the services related to theunderlying transaction are completed under the terms of theassignment. Non-refundable deposits and milestonepayments in connection with financial advisoryassignments are recognized in revenues upon completion ofthe underlying transaction or when the assignment isotherwise concluded.\nExpenses associated with financial advisory assignments\nare recognized when incurred and are included intransaction based expenses. Client reimbursements for suchexpenses are included in investment banking revenues.\nUnderwriting. Fees from underwriting assignments are\nrecognized in revenues upon completion of the underlyingtransaction based on the terms of the assignment.\nExpenses associated with underwriting assignments are\ngenerally deferred until the related revenue is recognized orthe assignment is otherwise concluded. Such expenses areincluded in transaction based expenses for completedassignments.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 127", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4196, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8bedad9-abc9-4395-81e2-1fa7d385f893": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8bedad9-abc9-4395-81e2-1fa7d385f893", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "131", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "09314896-79f4-4be7-9ec6-5b7ba0715af1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "131", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1f9b1216ea2218c1e4dc75a7f3df4f9a502ce49aa110909587c68a02ff4ed4cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9bec497-ed0a-45c1-8b2d-3b3ac353454c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "165e3866d1dd9055f730eff2222b4cda03c2d7ab747e087635bdef6833a2d15f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "07aef784-2647-47d0-9827-84c09d1b12f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d09bd8bd1d6b1ea5a1035c978d1a781c727d2a4a655618ec14f80a49d0788a36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "caaf2173167ee4b597426a3da246076c9f71cf90260dc8303a338a145a34852f", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Incentive fees are calculated as a\npercentage of a fund\u2019s or separately managed account\u2019sreturn, or excess return above a specified benchmark orother performance target. Incentive fees are generally basedon investment performance over a twelve-month period orover the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performanceover a twelve-month period are subject to adjustment priorto the end of the measurement period. For fees that arebased on investment performance over the life of the fund,future investment underperformance may require feespreviously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund.\nIncentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed\naccount are recognized when it is probable that a significantreversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally whensuch fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the marketvalue of investments held by the fund or separatelymanaged account. Therefore, incentive fees recognizedduring the period may relate to performance obligationssatisfied in previous periods.Commissions and Fees\nThe firm earns commissions and fees from executing andclearing client transactions on stock, options and futuresmarkets, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade isexecuted. The firm also provides third-party researchservices to clients in connection with certain soft-dollararrangements. Third-party research costs incurred by thefirm in connection with such arrangements are presentednet within commissions and fees.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations are services that thefirm has committed to perform in the future in connectionwith its contracts with clients. The firm\u2019s remainingperformance obligations are generally related to itsfinancial advisory assignments and certain investmentmanagement activities. Revenues associated with remainingperformance obligations relating to financial advisoryassignments cannot be determined until the outcome of thetransaction. For the firm\u2019s investment managementactivities, where fees are calculated based on the net assetvalue of the fund or separately managed account, futurerevenues associated with such remaining performanceobligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject tofluctuations in the market value of investments held by thefund or separately managed account.\nThe firm is able to determine the future revenues associated\nwith management fees calculated based on committedcapital. As of December 2021, substantially all future netrevenues associated with such remaining performanceobligations will be recognized through 2029. Annualrevenues associated with such performance obligationsaverage less than $250 million through 2029.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales whenthe firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred.For transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, anygains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets orliabilities that arise from the firm\u2019s continuing involvementwith transferred financial assets are initially recognized atfair value. For transfers of financial assets that are notaccounted for as sales, the assets are generally included intrading assets and the transfer is accounted for as acollateralized financing, with the related interest expenserecognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 forfurther information about transfers of financial assetsaccounted for as collateralized financings and Note 16 forfurther information about transfers of financial assetsaccounted for as sales.\n128 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4874, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07aef784-2647-47d0-9827-84c09d1b12f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "07aef784-2647-47d0-9827-84c09d1b12f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03452deb-4fbd-49e1-91f1-bfea69062a1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "396fa87c6da33d0061a7b2cd6d512838cdada2f2c8c153e67a6a79464fe910f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8bedad9-abc9-4395-81e2-1fa7d385f893", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "131", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "caaf2173167ee4b597426a3da246076c9f71cf90260dc8303a338a145a34852f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b1909bb7-088e-4ef6-a21c-9d7d4eb8deae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e439e4996d42d54682d317ca301546cb141780e843a87d6962f24b3bbfc737e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d09bd8bd1d6b1ea5a1035c978d1a781c727d2a4a655618ec14f80a49d0788a36", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In June 2016, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses(Topic 326) \u2014 Measurement of Credit Losses on FinancialInstruments.\u201d This ASU amends several aspects of themeasurement of credit losses on certain financialinstruments, including replacing the existing incurred creditloss model and other models with the Current ExpectedCredit Losses (CECL) model and amending certain aspectsof accounting for purchased financial assets withdeterioration in credit quality since origination.The firm adopted this ASU in January 2020 under a\nmodified retrospective approach. As a result of adoptingthis ASU, the firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses on financialassets and commitments that are measured at amortizedcost reflects management\u2019s estimate of credit losses over theremaining expected life of such assets. Expected creditlosses for newly recognized financial assets andcommitments, as well as changes to expected credit lossesduring the period, are recognized in earnings. Theseexpected credit losses are measured based on historicalexperience, current conditions and forecasts that affect thecollectability of the reported amount.\nThe cumulative effect of measuring the allowance under\nCECL as a result of adopting this ASU as ofJanuary 1, 2020 was an increase in the allowance for creditlosses of $848 million. The increase in the allowance isdriven by the fact that the allowance under CECL coversexpected credit losses over the full expected life of the loanportfolios and also takes into account forecasts of expectedfuture economic conditions. In addition, in accordance withthe ASU, the firm elected the fair value option for loans thatwere previously accounted for as Purchased CreditImpaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease to theallowance for PCI loans of $169 million. The cumulativeeffect of adopting this ASU was a decrease to retainedearnings of $638 million (net of tax).\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\nFinancial Reporting (ASC 848). In March 2020, the FASB\nissued ASU No. 2020-04, \u201cReference Rate Reform \u2014Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform onFinancial Reporting.\u201d This ASU provides optional relieffrom applying generally accepted accounting principles tocontracts, hedging relationships and other transactionsaffected by reference rate reform. In addition, inJanuary 2021 the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01,\u201cReference Rate Reform \u2014 Scope,\u201d which clarified thescope of ASC 848 relating to contract modifications. Thefirm adopted these ASUs upon issuance and elected to applythe relief available to certain modified derivatives. Theadoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact onthe firm\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n130 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4758, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3aea5e4e-18b0-41af-b860-c9bb05b82f8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3aea5e4e-18b0-41af-b860-c9bb05b82f8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42b73ea5-2b9a-472d-a994-975ac35fbf85", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "935651cd3cf5178f256eda5013157b255a39407658324e2f7c20195501abbeed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcbd9056-985d-48eb-acb1-63ff9dfd935c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1dcaa89563414cba8868745c246916afe163dda20dd29215e670c67feb6b6ade", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd33f649-4265-4ab7-b7af-6a9121153d46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "caba1452822326dcd6f3630ec9cee3b185fcc07ffb5c683eec06871377aabce6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c767f18fbd2449ed6ba55bd8337635355074c68c428fac5f26745250c7851c4c", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 4.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer aliability in an orderly transaction between marketparticipants at the measurement date. Financial assets aremarked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked tooffer prices. Fair value measurements do not includetransaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assetsand liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposureto market and/or credit risks).\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active\nmarket. If quoted prices in active markets are not available,fair value is determined by reference to prices for similarinstruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in lessactive markets, or internally developed models thatprimarily use market-based or independently sourcedinputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates,volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates,commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e.,the spread or difference between the interest rate at which aborrower could finance a given financial instrument relativeto a benchmark interest rate).\nU.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair\nvalue measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to thevaluation techniques used to measure fair value, giving thehighest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority tolevel 3 inputs. A financial instrument\u2019s level in thishierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that issignificant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating thesignificance of a valuation input, the firm considers, amongother factors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to that input.The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active\nmarkets to which the firm had access at the measurementdate for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2. Inputs to valuation techniques are observable,\neither directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3. One or more inputs to valuation techniques are\nsignificant and unobservable.The fair values for substantially all of the firm\u2019s financial\nassets and liabilities are based on observable prices andinputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair valuehierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets andliabilities may require valuation adjustments that a marketparticipant would require to arrive at fair value for factors,such as counterparty and the firm\u2019s credit quality, fundingrisk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.Valuation adjustments are generally based on marketevidence.\nThe valuation techniques and nature of significant inputs\nused to determine the fair value of the firm\u2019s financialinstruments are described below. See Notes 5 through 10for further information about significant unobservableinputs used to value level 3 financial instruments.\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for\nTrading Cash Instruments, Investments and LoansLevel 1. Level 1 instruments include U.S. government\nobligations, most non-U.S. government obligations, certainagency obligations, certain corporate debt instruments,certain money market instruments and actively traded listedequities. These instruments are valued using quoted pricesfor identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. Thefirm defines active markets for equity instruments based onthe average daily trading volume both in absolute terms andrelative to the market capitalization for the instrument. Thefirm defines active markets for debt instruments based onboth the average daily trading volume and the number ofdays with trading activity.\nLevel 2. Level 2 instruments include certain non-U.S.\ngovernment obligations, most agency obligations, mostmortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate debtinstruments, most state and municipal obligations, mostmoney market instruments, most other debt obligations,restricted or less liquid listed equities, certain privateequities, commodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted\nprices, recent trading activity for identical or similarinstruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternativepricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g.,indicative or executable) and the relationship of recentmarket activity to the prices provided from alternativepricing sources.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 131", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4603, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd33f649-4265-4ab7-b7af-6a9121153d46": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd33f649-4265-4ab7-b7af-6a9121153d46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4031aab-5c31-412d-ba7f-0049791a450f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a3b9c8e79a7e3381cf1bdd483d16f57de7905a116b2e402d5c2123c9f0bd9a79", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3aea5e4e-18b0-41af-b860-c9bb05b82f8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c767f18fbd2449ed6ba55bd8337635355074c68c428fac5f26745250c7851c4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b951d09-379a-4a1e-b3b0-bd6e2cf4bc50", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "980d8d6c3d8b739272da630cfc6f1c89fe0141b458c4c98f1028c872ae334037", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "caba1452822326dcd6f3630ec9cee3b185fcc07ffb5c683eec06871377aabce6", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Valuation adjustments are generally based onmarket evidence.\nLevel 3. Level 3 instruments have one or more significant\nvaluation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence tothe contrary, level 3 instruments are initially valued attransaction price, which is considered to be the best initialestimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses othermethodologies to determine fair value, which vary based onthe type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptionsare changed when corroborated by substantive observableevidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by\ninstrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flowtechniques. The valuation techniques and the nature ofsignificant inputs used to determine the fair values of eachtype of level 3 instrument are described below:\nLoans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real\nEstateLoans and securities backed by commercial real estate aredirectly or indirectly collateralized by a single property or aportfolio of properties and may include tranches of varyinglevels of subordination. Significant inputs are generallydetermined based on relative value analyses and include:\n\u2030Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related\nassets and/or current levels and changes in market indices,such as the CMBX (an index that tracks the performanceof commercial mortgage bonds);\n\u2030Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and\ninstruments with the same or similar underlyingcollateral;\n\u2030A measure of expected future cash flows in a default\nscenario (recovery rates) implied by the value of theunderlying collateral, which is mainly driven by currentperformance of the underlying collateral andcapitalization rates. Recovery rates are expressed as apercentage of notional or face value of the instrument andreflect the benefit of credit enhancements on certaininstruments; and\n\u2030Timing of expected future cash flows (duration) which, in\ncertain cases, may incorporate the impact of any loanforbearances and other unobservable inputs (e.g.,prepayment speeds).Loans and Securities Backed by Residential Real\nEstateLoans and securities backed by residential real estate aredirectly or indirectly collateralized by portfolios ofresidential real estate and may include tranches of varyinglevels of subordination. Significant inputs are generallydetermined based on relative value analyses, whichincorporate comparisons to instruments with similarcollateral and risk profiles. Significant inputs include:\n\u2030Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related\nassets;\n\u2030Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and\ninstruments with the same or similar underlying collateral;\n\u2030Cumulative loss expectations, driven by default rates,\nhome price projections, residential property liquidationtimelines, related costs and subsequent recoveries; and\n\u2030Duration, driven by underlying loan prepayment speeds\nand residential property liquidation timelines.\nCorporate Debt Instruments\nCorporate debt instruments includes corporate loans, debtsecurities and convertible debentures. Significant inputs forcorporate debt instruments are generally determined basedon relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisonsboth to prices of credit default swaps that reference thesame or similar underlying instrument or entity and toother debt instruments for the same or similar issuer forwhich observable prices or broker quotations are available.Significant inputs include:\n\u2030Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related\nassets and/or current levels and trends of market indices,such as the CDX (an index that tracks the performance ofcorporate credit);\n\u2030Current performance and recovery assumptions and,\nwhere the firm uses credit default swaps to value therelated instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlyingreference obligation;\n\u2030Duration; and\n\u2030Market and transaction multiples for corporate debt\ninstruments with convertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities consists of private equities. Recent third-party completed or pending transactions (e.g., mergerproposals, debt restructurings, tender offers) are consideredthe best evidence for any change in fair value. When theseare not available, the following valuation methodologiesare used, as appropriate:\n\u2030Industry multiples (primarily EBITDA and revenue\nmultiples) and public comparables;\n\u2030Transactions in similar instruments;\n132 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4812, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b951d09-379a-4a1e-b3b0-bd6e2cf4bc50": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b951d09-379a-4a1e-b3b0-bd6e2cf4bc50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d7e85c70-c4b1-4b8e-a51a-72f8f430a246", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5030fed51bcaaeb3dbc8084fa61d11f47335663ece0f820e0e6d88cb491fff0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd33f649-4265-4ab7-b7af-6a9121153d46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "caba1452822326dcd6f3630ec9cee3b185fcc07ffb5c683eec06871377aabce6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2bcfb24-38e6-4274-a4b3-cb377d56e263", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "135505064d9e26fe7f51e38e19c97773de6e965643db585d8b5292f5287f4b6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "980d8d6c3d8b739272da630cfc6f1c89fe0141b458c4c98f1028c872ae334037", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Price transparency of derivatives can generallybe characterized by product type, as described below.\n\u2030Interest Rate. In general, the key inputs used to value\ninterest rate derivatives are transparent, even for mostlong-dated contracts. Interest rate swaps and optionsdenominated in the currencies of leading industrializednations are characterized by high trading volumes and tightbid/offer spreads. Interest rate derivatives that referenceindices, such as an inflation index, or the shape of the yieldcurve (e.g., 10-year swap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) aremore complex, but the key inputs are generally observable.\u2030Credit. Price transparency for credit default swaps,\nincluding both single names and baskets of credits, variesby market and underlying reference entity or obligation.Credit default swaps that reference indices, largecorporates and major sovereigns generally exhibit themost price transparency. For credit default swaps withother underliers, price transparency varies based on creditrating, the cost of borrowing the underlying referenceobligations, and the availability of the underlyingreference obligations for delivery upon the default of theissuer. Credit default swaps that reference loans, asset-backed securities and emerging market debt instrumentstend to have less price transparency than those thatreference corporate bonds. In addition, more complexcredit derivatives, such as those sensitive to thecorrelation between two or more underlying referenceobligations, generally have less price transparency.\n\u2030Currency. Prices for currency derivatives based on the\nexchange rates of leading industrialized nations,including those with longer tenors, are generallytransparent. The primary difference between the pricetransparency of developed and emerging market currencyderivatives is that emerging markets tend to be onlyobservable for contracts with shorter tenors.\n\u2030Commodity. Commodity derivatives include transactions\nreferenced to energy (e.g., oil, natural gas and electricity),metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities (e.g.,agricultural). Price transparency varies based on theunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor andproduct quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared to unleadedgasoline). In general, price transparency for commodityderivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors andcontracts that are more closely aligned with major and/orbenchmark commodity indices.\n\u2030Equity. Price transparency for equity derivatives varies by\nmarket and underlier. Options on indices and thecommon stock of corporates included in major equityindices exhibit the most price transparency. Equityderivatives generally have observable market prices,except for contracts with long tenors or reference pricesthat differ significantly from current market prices. Morecomplex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to thecorrelation between two or more individual stocks,generally have less price transparency.\nLiquidity is essential to observability of all product types. If\ntransaction volumes decline, previously transparent pricesand other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely,even highly structured products may at times have tradingvolumes large enough to provide observability of prices andother inputs.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 133", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5077, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2bcfb24-38e6-4274-a4b3-cb377d56e263": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2bcfb24-38e6-4274-a4b3-cb377d56e263", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da660c8d-e9ff-4da9-9e34-20fd7703d9df", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "fdeb2d85bd59291d798726196b7090c3c32691b9d050672dd9e8dea97d7b7e04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b951d09-379a-4a1e-b3b0-bd6e2cf4bc50", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "980d8d6c3d8b739272da630cfc6f1c89fe0141b458c4c98f1028c872ae334037", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b6a0c95f-17ed-4aa4-a796-68043abf87dd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8931532267f7d24e23516c4b338a166658eb707fddbedda37daea2d3e029ea1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "135505064d9e26fe7f51e38e19c97773de6e965643db585d8b5292f5287f4b6e", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For derivatives thattrade in liquid markets, model selection does not involvesignificant management judgment because outputs ofmodels can be calibrated to market-clearing levels.\nValuation models require a variety of inputs, such as\ncontractual terms, market prices, yield curves, discountrates (including those derived from interest rates oncollateral received and posted as specified in credit supportagreements for collateralized derivatives), credit curves,measures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity ratesand correlations of such inputs. Significant inputs to thevaluations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to markettransactions, broker or dealer quotations or otheralternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of pricetransparency. Consideration is given to the nature of thequotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and therelationship of recent market activity to the prices providedfrom alternative pricing sources.\nLevel 3. Level 3 derivatives are valued using models which\nutilize observable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as well asunobservable level 3 inputs. The significant unobservableinputs used to value the firm\u2019s level 3 derivatives aredescribed below.\n\u2030For level 3 interest rate and currency derivatives,\nsignificant unobservable inputs include correlations ofcertain currencies and interest rates (e.g., the correlationbetween Euro inflation and Euro interest rates) andspecific interest rate and currency volatilities.\n\u2030For level 3 credit derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs include illiquid credit spreads and upfront creditpoints, which are unique to specific reference obligationsand reference entities, and recovery rates.\u2030For level 3 commodity derivatives, significant\nunobservable inputs include volatilities for options withstrike prices that differ significantly from current marketprices and prices or spreads for certain products for whichthe product quality or physical location of the commodityis not aligned with benchmark indices.\n\u2030For level 3 equity derivatives, significant unobservable\ninputs generally include equity volatility inputs foroptions that are long-dated and/or have strike prices thatdiffer significantly from current market prices. Inaddition, the valuation of certain structured tradesrequires the use of level 3 correlation inputs, such as thecorrelation of the price performance of two or moreindividual stocks or the correlation of the priceperformance for a basket of stocks to another asset class,such as commodities.\nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative,\nthe firm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflectobservable market changes and any resulting gains andlosses are classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changedwhen corroborated by evidence, such as similar markettransactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker ordealer quotations or other empirical market data. Incircumstances where the firm cannot verify the model valueby reference to market transactions, it is possible that adifferent valuation model could produce a materiallydifferent estimate of fair value. See Note 7 for furtherinformation about significant unobservable inputs used inthe valuation of level 3 derivatives.\nValuation Adjustments. Valuation adjustments are\nintegral to determining the fair value of derivativeportfolios and are used to adjust the mid-market valuationsproduced by derivative pricing models to the exit pricevaluation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads,the cost of liquidity, and credit and funding valuationadjustments, which account for the credit and funding riskinherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivativeportfolios. The firm also makes funding valuationadjustments to collateralized derivatives where the terms ofthe agreement do not permit the firm to deliver or repledgecollateral received.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nMarket Making. As a market maker, the firm enters into\nderivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and tofacilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role,the firm typically acts as principal and is required to commitcapital to provide execution, and maintains market-makingpositions in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand.\nRisk Management. The firm also enters into derivatives to\nactively manage risk exposures that arise from its market-making and investing and financing activities. The firm\u2019sholdings and exposures are hedged, in many cases, on eithera portfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to aninstrument-by-instrument basis. The offsetting impact ofthis economic hedging is reflected in the same businesssegment as the related revenues. In addition, the firm mayenter into derivatives designated as hedges under U.S.GAAP. These derivatives are used to manage interest rateexposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured borrowings anddeposits, foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-salesecurities and the net investment in certain non-U.S.operations, and the price risk of certain commodities.\nThe firm enters into various types of derivatives, including:\u2030Futures and Forwards. Contracts that commit\ncounterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments,commodities or currencies in the future.\n\u2030Swaps. Contracts that require counterparties to\nexchange cash flows, such as currency or interestpayment streams. The amounts exchanged are based onthe specific terms of the contract with reference tospecified rates, financial instruments, commodities,currencies or indices.\n\u2030Options. Contracts in which the option purchaser has\nthe right, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sellto the option writer financial instruments, commoditiesor currencies within a defined time period for a specifiedprice.\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e.,\nthe net payable or receivable for derivative assets andliabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right ofsetoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement(counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fairvalue, net of cash collateral received or posted underenforceable credit support agreements (cash collateralnetting).

In general, for contracts where the holder\nbenefits from the convergence of the underlying asset orindex prices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, foreignexchange rates, inflation rates and equity prices), anincrease in correlation results in a higher fair valuemeasurement.\n\u2030Volatility. In general, for purchased options, an increase\nin volatility results in a higher fair value measurement.\n\u2030Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery\nrates. In general, the fair value of purchased credit\nprotection increases as credit spreads or upfront creditpoints increase or recovery rates decrease. Credit spreads,upfront credit points and recovery rates are stronglyrelated to distinctive risk factors of the underlyingreference obligations, which include reference entity-specific factors, such as leverage, volatility and industry,market-based risk factors, such as borrowing costs orliquidity of the underlying reference obligation, andmacroeconomic conditions.\n\u2030Commodity prices and spreads. In general, for\ncontracts where the holder is receiving a commodity, anincrease in the spread (price difference from a benchmarkindex due to differences in quality or delivery location) orprice results in a higher fair value measurement.\nDue to the distinctive nature of each of the firm\u2019s level 3\nderivatives, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarilyuniform within each product type.Level 3 Rollforward\nThe table below presents a summary of the changes in fairvalue for level 3 derivatives.\nYear Ended December\n$ in millions 2021 2020\nTotal level 3 derivatives, net\nBeginning balance $ 1,175 $2 5\nNet realized gains/(losses) 265 226\nNet unrealized gains/(losses) 452 612\nPurchases 501 319\nSales (1,541) (724)\nSettlements (59) 750\nTransfers into level 3 (131) (40)\nTransfers out of level 3 (222) 7\nEnding balance $ 440 $1,175\nIn the table above:\n\u2030Changes in fair value are presented for all derivative\nassets and liabilities that are classified in level 3 as of theend of the period.\n\u2030Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates to instruments that\nwere still held at period-end.\n\u2030Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are\nreported at the beginning of the reporting period in whichthey occur.

The buyer of protection pays an initial orperiodic premium to the seller and receives protection forthe period of the contract. If there is no credit event, asdefined in the contract, the seller of protection makes nopayments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the sellerof protection is required to make a payment to the buyer,calculated according to the terms of the contract.\n\u2030Credit Options. In a credit option, the option writer\nassumes the obligation to purchase or sell a referenceobligation at a specified price or credit spread. The optionpurchaser buys the right, but does not assume theobligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchaseit from, the option writer. The payments on credit optionsdepend either on a particular credit spread or the price ofthe reference obligation.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 145", "start_char_idx": 2155, "end_char_idx": 4089, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca73382a-845e-49bd-a797-6b33a25f39b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca73382a-845e-49bd-a797-6b33a25f39b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e7e0b0d-669b-4b7a-93d4-bf444db3631b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5679fdf8db5145530bf14664bc8a7e568c8cd2e2d4b315bda3d75a3feac260c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02de787a-6334-4cc1-a00a-59f6fed887f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "148", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "78215fe7913ccd2108ae43d26972cde5785dba9de4e60474c2e0215bbbcbd552", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "00e7cb62-04a9-4c69-8a9a-4b73c99ea461", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ae75991bed10737385d7e6377df80b5f14790576cfd7a2394780d63c388aa3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "22511b26a7e73f8c0fd2abeb4d0547a82e9a10beea927ae7c7e9918926f6530d", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Credit\nderivatives may reference a basket of single-name creditdefault swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit eventoccurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, theprotection seller pays the protection buyer. The paymentis typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction\u2019s totalnotional amount based on the underlying defaultedreference obligation. In certain transactions, the creditrisk of a basket or index is separated into various portions(tranches), each having different levels of subordination.The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and oncelosses exceed the notional amount of these juniortranches, any excess loss is covered by the next mostsenior tranche.\n\u2030Total Return Swaps. A total return swap transfers the\nrisks relating to economic performance of a referenceobligation from the protection buyer to the protectionseller. Typically, the protection buyer receives a floatingrate of interest and protection against any reduction infair value of the reference obligation, and the protectionseller receives the cash flows associated with the referenceobligation, plus any increase in the fair value of thereference obligation.\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit\nderivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchasedcredit derivatives with identical underliers.

An interest rate swap is consideredhighly effective in offsetting changes in fair valueattributable to changes in the hedged risk when theregression analysis results in a coefficient of determinationof 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%.\nFor qualifying interest rate fair value hedges, gains or losses\non derivatives are included in interest expense.

Loans and lendingcommitments accounted for at fair value or accounted forat the lower of cost or fair value are not subject to anallowance for credit losses.\nTo determine the allowance for credit losses, the firm\nclassifies its loans and lending commitments accounted forat amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios.These portfolios represent the level at which the firm hasdeveloped and documented its methodology to determinethe allowance for credit losses. The allowance for creditlosses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibitsimilar risk characteristics using a modeled approach andasset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar riskcharacteristics.\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the\nweighted average of a range of forecasts of future economicconditions over the expected life of the loan and lendingcommitments. The expected life of each loan or lendingcommitment is determined based on the contractual termadjusted for extension options or demand features, or ismodeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. Theforecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economicscenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expectedlives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical lossinformation based on a non-linear modeled approach. Theforecasted economic scenarios consider a number of riskfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfoliosdescribed below. The firm applies judgment in weighingindividual scenarios each quarter based on a variety offactors, including the firm\u2019s internally derived economicoutlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomicconditions and industry trends.\nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative\ncomponents which allow management to reflect theuncertain nature of economic forecasting, captureuncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for modelimprecision and concentration risk.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 159", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3983, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47e026c2-7c79-4cad-b2bc-db13b58e8c6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "47e026c2-7c79-4cad-b2bc-db13b58e8c6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67e1b2cd-a160-4b27-b9ff-cabdb6d229e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "42c0c0a2aa4c79d422ab9175f95238da1fc9dec4bd3fe5d76df2129b4d4020d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ad67be2-92e1-42e6-be0a-9435d9885770", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3f0aac675a419921593770d38d5cb456f8dba5ef4bb03adc242ee5657836f76c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5487c55a-a67e-4e1a-ab55-884c4f0c482e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2fa86b449d3d64d004293e564d883daaa92ce7482cdf6097047e388c1c1144d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "798f59131406f91e58a8dbb051f198cc73753b3ef61638f14b174e815cd7b004", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The allowance for credit losses for wholesale\nloans and lending commitments that exhibit similar riskcharacteristics is measured using a modeled approach.These models determine the probability of default and lossgiven default based on various risk factors, includinginternal credit ratings, industry default and loss data,expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower\u2019scapacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower\u2019scountry of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateraltype. For lending commitments, the methodology alsoconsiders probability of drawdowns or funding. Inaddition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factorsinclude the loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and homeprice index. The most significant inputs to the forecastmodel for wholesale loans and lending commitmentsinclude unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads,commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- andlong-term interest rates, and oil prices.\nThe allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do\nnot share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrualloans or loans in a TDR, is calculated using the presentvalue of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019soriginal effective rate, the observable market price of theloan or the fair value of the collateral.\nWholesale loans are charged off against the allowance for\nloan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\nConsumer. The allowance for credit losses for consumer\nloans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is calculatedusing a modeled approach which classifies consumer loansinto pools based on borrower-related and exposure-relatedcharacteristics that differentiate a pool\u2019s risk characteristicsfrom other pools. The factors considered in determining apool are generally consistent with the risk characteristicsused for internal credit risk measurement and managementand include key metrics, such as FICO credit scores,delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomicindicators.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4529, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5487c55a-a67e-4e1a-ab55-884c4f0c482e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5487c55a-a67e-4e1a-ab55-884c4f0c482e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67e1b2cd-a160-4b27-b9ff-cabdb6d229e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "42c0c0a2aa4c79d422ab9175f95238da1fc9dec4bd3fe5d76df2129b4d4020d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "47e026c2-7c79-4cad-b2bc-db13b58e8c6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "798f59131406f91e58a8dbb051f198cc73753b3ef61638f14b174e815cd7b004", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "19d32b02-81cb-4cd9-813c-5479d2dd5d50", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f22e801ca9e1fd5a9dfa4b3d9dd27ee95007a0208ad1c5d7ecedfe6084cf4764", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2fa86b449d3d64d004293e564d883daaa92ce7482cdf6097047e388c1c1144d0", "text": "The allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do\nnot share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrualloans or loans in a TDR, is calculated using the presentvalue of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019soriginal effective rate, the observable market price of theloan or the fair value of the collateral.\nWholesale loans are charged off against the allowance for\nloan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\nConsumer.

The primaryreasons for electing the fair value option are to:\n\u2030Reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis;\n\u2030Mitigate volatility in earnings from using different\nmeasurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financial assetsaccounted for as financings are recorded at fair value,whereas the related secured financing would be recordedon an accrual basis absent electing the fair value option);and\n\u2030Address simplification and cost-benefit considerations\n(e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fairvalue in their entirety versus bifurcation of embeddedderivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts).\nHybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain\nbifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not requiresettlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g.,physical commodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate theembedded derivative from the associated debt, thederivative is accounted for at fair value and the hostcontract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for theeffective portion of any fair value hedges. If the firm doesnot elect to bifurcate, the entire hybrid financial instrumentis accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\nOther financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair\nvalue under the fair value option include:\n\u2030Resale and repurchase agreements;\n\u2030Certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions;\n\u2030Certain customer and other receivables and certain other\nliabilities;\n\u2030Certain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity\nare not eligible for a fair value option election), includingstructured certificates of deposit, which are hybridfinancial instruments;\n\u2030Substantially all other secured financings, including\ntransfers of assets accounted for as financings; and\n\u2030Certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings,\nsubstantially all of which are hybrid financialinstruments.\n164 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4204, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e242aa3-d72f-4d7b-afff-06e19ae6f926": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e242aa3-d72f-4d7b-afff-06e19ae6f926", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fec6449f-4af9-45fc-8ddf-bd0eb9a38964", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "fb3edc1de0ed43676e774dc631b3263792a08319fc604f32a1e161df8dc99c52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b25b0e71-b643-4708-9485-d521a7aa653b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "9d475d444dc3bbe2e86ba69069c5074fa4b3248bbb34ed7288a59c86c461be39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "408af4b3-146d-436c-9747-bd9b65f8a1d0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e71e7f031daec248a7239c2d7a558407e1b01e2f60b9a802f05a7a416fee8949", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "564515417824030cd2c3cd891ac7135e8d2a50988600260b6728684ebd39a038", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 11.\nCollateralized Agreements and Financings\nCollateralized agreements are resale agreements and\nsecurities borrowed. Collateralized financings arerepurchase agreements, securities loaned and other securedfinancings. The firm enters into these transactions in orderto, among other things, facilitate client activities, investexcess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions andfinance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings are presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty basis when a legal right of setoff exists.Interest on collateralized agreements, which is included ininterest income, and collateralized financings, which isincluded in interest expense, is recognized over the life ofthe transaction. See Note 23 for further information aboutinterest income and interest expense.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements\nA resale agreement is a transaction in which the firmpurchases financial instruments from a seller, typically inexchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into anagreement to resell the same or substantially the samefinancial instruments to the seller at a stated price plusaccrued interest at a future date.\nA repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm\nsells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchangefor cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement torepurchase the same or substantially the same financialinstruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accruedinterest at a future date.\nEven though repurchase and resale agreements (including\n\u201crepos- and reverses-to-maturity\u201d) involve the legaltransfer of ownership of financial instruments, they areaccounted for as financing arrangements because theyrequire the financial instruments to be repurchased orresold before or at the maturity of the agreement. Thefinancial instruments purchased or sold in resale andrepurchase agreements typically include U.S. governmentand agency, and investment-grade sovereign obligations.\nThe firm receives financial instruments purchased under\nresale agreements and makes delivery of financialinstruments sold under repurchase agreements. To mitigatecredit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of thesefinancial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers orobtains additional collateral due to changes in the marketvalue of the financial instruments, as appropriate. Forresale agreements, the firm typically requires collateral witha fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of therelevant assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Securities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions\nIn a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrowssecurities from a counterparty in exchange for cash orsecurities. When the firm returns the securities, thecounterparty returns the cash or securities. Interest isgenerally paid periodically over the life of the transaction.\nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities\nto a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. Whenthe counterparty returns the securities, the firm returns thecash or securities posted as collateral. Interest is generallypaid periodically over the life of the transaction.\nThe firm receives securities borrowed and makes delivery of\nsecurities loaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firmmonitors the market value of these securities on a dailybasis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due tochanges in the market value of the securities, asappropriate. For securities borrowed transactions, the firmtypically requires collateral with a fair value approximatelyequal to the carrying value of the securities borrowedtransaction.\nSecurities borrowed and loaned within Fixed Income,\nCurrency and Commodities (FICC) financing are recordedat fair value under the fair value option. See Note 10 forfurther information about securities borrowed and loanedaccounted for at fair value.\nSubstantially all of securities borrowed and loaned within\nEquities financing are recorded based on the amount ofcash collateral advanced or received plus accrued interest.The firm also reviews such securities borrowed todetermine if an allowance for credit losses should berecorded by taking into consideration the fair value ofcollateral received. As these agreements generally can beterminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivityto changes in interest rates. Therefore, the carrying value ofsuch agreements approximates fair value. As theseagreements are not accounted for at fair value, they are notincluded in the firm\u2019s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4through 10.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the firm performed its annual\nassessment of goodwill for impairment, for each of itsreporting units, by performing a qualitative assessment.Multiple factors were assessed with respect to each of thefirm\u2019s reporting units to determine whether it was morelikely than not that the estimated fair value of any of thosereporting units was less than its estimated carrying value.The qualitative assessment also considered changes since aquantitative test was last performed in 2019.\nThe firm considered the following factors in the qualitative\nannual assessment when evaluating whether it was morelikely than not that the estimated fair value of a reportingunit was less than its estimated carrying value:\n\u2030Performance Indicators. During 2021, the firm\u2019s net\nrevenues, diluted earnings per common share (EPS),return on average common shareholders\u2019 equity and bookvalue per common share all increased from 2020 andfrom when a quantitative test was last performed in 2019.The firm\u2019s operating expenses increased, primarilyreflecting significantly higher compensation and benefitsexpenses (reflecting strong financial performance).Despite the increase in expenses, both the efficiency ratio(total operating expenses divided by total net revenues)and pre-tax margin improved compared with 2020.\n\u2030Macroeconomic Indicators. The global economy\ncontinued to recover during 2021 from the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic, as the lifting of health and safetyrestrictions amid vaccine distribution facilitated anincrease in global economic recovery, and monetary andfiscal policy from central banks and governmentsremained accommodative. However, there remainsuncertainty related to the impact and the duration of theCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2030Firm and Industry Events. There were no events, entity-\nspecific or otherwise, that would have had a significantnegative impact on the valuation of the firm\u2019s reportingunits.\n\u2030Fair Value Indicators. Since the 2020 qualitative\ngoodwill test, fair value indicators in the market generallyimproved, as global equity prices were higher, creditspreads were tighter, and the firm and its peers\u2019 stockprices and price-to-book multiples were higher. Despiteincreased inflation concerns, supply chain challenges andthe rise in COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter of 2021,the firm\u2019s stock price and price-to-book multiple endedthe year higher compared with the end of 2020.As a result of the qualitative assessment, the firm\ndetermined that it was more likely than not that theestimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded itsrespective estimated carrying value. Therefore, the firmdetermined that goodwill for each reporting unit was notimpaired and that a quantitative goodwill test was notrequired.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nThe table below presents identifiable intangible assets byreporting unit and type.\nAs of December\n$ in millions 2021 2020\nBy Reporting Unit\nGlobal Markets:\nFICC $1 $2\nEquities 43 45\nAsset Management 122 274\nConsumer & Wealth Management:\nConsumer banking \u2013 6\nWealth management 252 303\nTotal $ 418 $ 630\nBy Type\nCustomer lists\nGross carrying value $ 1,460 $ 1,478\nAccumulated amortization (1,130) (1,089)\nNet carrying value 330 389\nAcquired leases and other\nGross carrying value 500 710\nAccumulated amortization (412) (469)\nNet carrying value 88 241\nTotal gross carrying value 1,960 2,188\nTotal accumulated amortization (1,542) (1,558)\nTotal net carrying value $ 418 $ 630\nDuring 2021, the amount of intangible assets acquired by\nthe firm was not material.

There were no material impairmentsduring 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Assets\nThe firm enters into operating leases for real estate, officeequipment and other assets, substantially all of which areused in connection with its operations. For leases longerthan one year, the firm recognizes a right-of-use assetrepresenting the right to use the underlying asset for thelease term, and a lease liability representing the liability tomake payments. The lease term is generally determinedbased on the contractual maturity of the lease. For leaseswhere the firm has the option to terminate or extend thelease, an assessment of the likelihood of exercising theoption is incorporated into the determination of the leaseterm. Such assessment is initially performed at the inceptionof the lease and is updated if events occur that impact theoriginal assessment.An operating lease right-of-use asset is initially determined\nbased on the operating lease liability, adjusted for initialdirect costs, lease incentives and amounts paid at or prior tolease commencement. This amount is then amortized overthe lease term. The firm recognized $305 million for 2021,$182 million for 2020 and $963 million (primarily relatedto the firm\u2019s European headquarters in London) for 2019 ofright-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in non-cashtransactions for leases entered into or assumed. See Note 15for information about operating lease liabilities.\nFor leases where the firm will derive no economic benefit\nfrom leased space that it has vacated or where the firm hasshortened the term of a lease when space is no longerneeded, the firm will record an impairment or acceleratedamortization of right-of-use assets. There were no materialimpairments or accelerated amortizations during 2021 and2020.\nMiscellaneous Receivables and Other\nMiscellaneous receivables and other included:\n\u2030Investments in qualified affordable housing projects of\n$714 million as of December 2021 and $678 million as ofDecember 2020.\n\u2030Assets classified as held for sale of $1.02 billion as of\nDecember 2021 and $437 million as of December 2020related to certain of the firm\u2019s consolidated investmentswithin the Asset Management segment, substantially allof which consisted of property and equipment.\nNote 13.\nDeposits\nThe table below presents the types and sources of deposits.\n$ in millionsSavings and\nDemand Time Total\nAs of December 2021\nConsumer $ 89,150 $ 20,533 $109,683\nPrivate bank 85,427 9,665 95,092\nBrokered certificates of deposit \u2013 30,816 30,816\nDeposit sweep programs 37,965 \u2013 37,965\nTransaction banking 48,618 5,689 54,307\nOther 275 36,089 36,364\nTotal $261,435 $102,792 $364,227\nAs of December 2020\nConsumer $ 67,395 $ 29,530 $ 96,925\nPrivate bank 67,185 1,183 68,368Brokered certificates of deposit \u2013 30,060 30,060Deposit sweep programs 22,987 \u2013 22,987Transaction banking 28,852 \u2013 28,852Other \u2013 12,770 12,770\nTotal $186,419 $ 73,543 $259,962\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 175", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4063, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2aa8e144-904e-4500-941b-77015a84cc1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2aa8e144-904e-4500-941b-77015a84cc1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "523c9f32-3a87-4f8e-9c97-f317f8c48b4c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "17070995bc8a32791a65211a4d95f5503a2ade9379e228640f850659ec3a9994", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf79af4d-11f4-42c2-bda2-5c8b951a8e84", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "134ccdf90938002d8b4b39dc90995f15363b471dc4b912aa45e930f6ac3689d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a135d6f8-a627-4aaf-9b03-02f628b84974", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2fc3d37d45d56cf521c9204a515bf7716d52ac27cb21aa2cbcea42d263358d75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "166f22213f9843d60023058ddd798d9ff92a4aee7fe697c53199ed13c7458cfb", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm acts as underwriter ofthe beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm\u2019sresidential mortgage securitizations are primarily inconnection with government agency securitizations.The firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has\nrelinquished control over the transferred financial assets.Prior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assetspending transfer at fair value and therefore does nottypically recognize significant gains or losses upon thetransfer of assets. Net revenues from underwriting activitiesare recognized in connection with the sales of theunderlying beneficial interests to investors.\nThe firm generally receives cash in exchange for the\ntransferred assets but may also have continuinginvolvement with the transferred financial assets, includingownership of beneficial interests in securitized financialassets, primarily in the form of debt instruments. The firmmay also purchase senior or subordinated securities issuedby securitization vehicles (which are typically VIEs) inconnection with secondary market-making activities.\nThe primary risks included in beneficial interests and other\ninterests from the firm\u2019s continuing involvement withsecuritization vehicles are the performance of theunderlying collateral, the position of the firm\u2019s investmentin the capital structure of the securitization vehicle and themarket yield for the security. Interests accounted for at fairvalue are primarily classified in level 2 of the fair valuehierarchy. Interests not accounted for at fair value arecarried at amounts that approximate fair value.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 17.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt or\nequity) or other interest (e.g., derivatives or loans andlending commitments) that will absorb portions of theVIE\u2019s expected losses and/or receive portions of the VIE\u2019sexpected residual returns.\nThe firm\u2019s variable interests in VIEs include senior and\nsubordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limitedand general partnership interests; preferred and commonequity; derivatives that may include foreign currency,equity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the feesthe firm receives from investment funds. Certain interestrate, foreign currency and credit derivatives the firm entersinto with VIEs are not variable interests because theycreate, rather than absorb, risk.\nVIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt\nand equity securities that are either collateralized by orindexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equitysecurities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varyinglevels of subordination. The firm\u2019s involvement with VIEsincludes securitization of financial assets, as described inNote 16, and investments in and loans to other types ofVIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the firm\u2019sconsolidation policies, including the definition of a VIE.\nVIE Consolidation Analysis\nThe enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIEis known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates theVIE. The firm determines whether it is the primarybeneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis thatprincipally considers:\n\u2030Which variable interest holder has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly impact theVIE\u2019s economic performance;\n\u2030Which variable interest holder has the obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIEthat could potentially be significant to the VIE;\n\u2030The VIE\u2019s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE\nwas designed to create and pass through to its variableinterest holders;\n\u2030The VIE\u2019s capital structure;\n\u2030The terms between the VIE and its variable interest\nholders and other parties involved with the VIE; and\n\u2030Related-party relationships.The firm reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a\nVIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firmreassesses its determination of whether it is the primarybeneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on currentfacts and circumstances.\nVIE Activities\nThe firm is principally involved with VIEs through thefollowing business activities:\nMortgage-Backed VIEs. The firm sells residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assetssold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficialinterests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connectionwith market-making activities. In addition, the firm mayenter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarilyinterest rate swaps, which are typically not variableinterests. The firm generally enters into derivatives withother counterparties to mitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit- and Power-Related and Other\nInvesting VIEs. The firm purchases equity and debt\nsecurities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold realestate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressedloans, power-related assets and equity securities. The firmgenerally does not sell assets to, or enter into derivativeswith, these VIEs.\nCorporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs. The\nfirm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchasesand sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt andother asset-backed VIEs in connection with market-makingactivities, and makes loans to VIEs that warehousecorporate debt. Certain of these VIEs synthetically createthe exposure for the beneficial interests they issue byentering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather thanpurchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm mayenter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, withcertain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, underwhich the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficialinterest holders and receives the return on the collateralowned by the VIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs isprimarily other asset-backed loans and securities. The firmmay be removed as the total return swap counterparty andmay enter into derivatives with other counterparties tomitigate its risk related to these swaps. The firm may sellassets to the corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs itstructures.\n182 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4636, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0a530b5-b9e4-43c8-839c-8ed662459f19": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0a530b5-b9e4-43c8-839c-8ed662459f19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "47bf0cde-d289-438e-972f-5ecbd7b25120", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e761281ab81fbc4bc778502124b39f1aaf9e9e94527f441f85172a47ea1cbcff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f920b4c8-122e-4a7a-a88a-2d5284f4c580", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "185", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "aedee78747b7491ac22d7b4aaec815d1f95dbd233a4e86f0a2b18b0ff60dc1ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ed8db38-5627-4aaf-854a-564a53af52ee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "546fe770586ddebb39250e4190be5172151524ec2294069426f5c1f5bb7b4570", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e6ad3da5e4097d08f65949ee931bfe83791f46c520ce01cfcee10cc377c3a092", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm enters into various\nderivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee underU.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity putoptions, written currency contracts and interest rate caps,floors and swaptions. These derivatives are risk managedtogether with derivatives that do not meet the definition ofa guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table abovedo not reflect the firm\u2019s overall risk related to derivativeactivities. Disclosures about derivatives are not required ifthey may be cash settled and the firm has no basis toconclude it is probable that the counterparties held theunderlying instruments at inception of the contract. Thefirm has concluded that these conditions have been met forcertain large, internationally active commercial andinvestment bank counterparties, central clearingcounterparties, hedge funds and certain othercounterparties. Accordingly, the firm has not included suchcontracts in the table above. See Note 7 for informationabout credit derivatives that meet the definition of aguarantee, which are not included in the table above.\nDerivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the\ncarrying value is considered the best indication of payment/performance risk for individual contracts. However, thecarrying values in the table above exclude the effect ofcounterparty and cash collateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees. Securities\nlending and clearing guarantees include theindemnifications and guarantees that the firm provides inits capacity as an agency lender and in its capacity as asponsoring member of the Fixed Income ClearingCorporation.\nAs an agency lender, the firm indemnifies most of its\nsecurities lending customers against losses incurred in theevent that borrowers do not return securities and thecollateral held is insufficient to cover the market value ofthe securities borrowed. The maximum payout of suchindemnifications was $11.05 billion as of December 2021and $19.86 billion as of December 2020. Collateral held bythe lenders in connection with securities lendingindemnifications was $11.36 billion as of December 2021and $20.39 billion as of December 2020. Because thecontractual nature of these arrangements requires the firmto obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds thevalue of the securities lent to the borrower, there is minimalperformance risk associated with these indemnifications.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 187", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3986, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efcffb24-0af9-4238-ae22-4db48a85f35a": {"__data__": {"id_": "efcffb24-0af9-4238-ae22-4db48a85f35a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d41411d0-e24f-4c43-a0bb-dead64babc5f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8442259377cfe19b2ee43f2a6aa0528f50345b36c872676e337e0d989c4d7035", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b680ea2a-250a-4d0a-baa6-d4a71df54594", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "190", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "2a07f61b6b97929ccb1ae5303d7f3e121f29f948b73718651762d6b2f14b6837", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d1565669-cbd8-4786-b5db-f91556ed7d52", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6c02b2da148549fcf2f17286b0dd6aa4720e05d78b7faa6748fc92180268c22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "464e95f4dd7ff6e887d22ef7e1ddeb5e40d56e545627e9f460340ab1b923a73a", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Therefore, the risk of loss on such guaranteesis minimal. There were no amounts outstanding under theguarantee as of December 2021. As of December 2020, themaximum payout on this guarantee was $1.49 billion andthe related collateral held was $1.50 billion.\nOther Financial Guarantees. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the firm provides other financial guarantees of theobligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of creditand other guarantees to enable clients to completetransactions and fund-related guarantees). Theseguarantees represent obligations to make payments tobeneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill itsobligation under a contractual arrangement with thatbeneficiary. Other financial guarantees also include aguarantee that the firm has provided to the Government ofMalaysia that it will receive at least $1.4 billion in assetsand proceeds from assets seized by governmentalauthorities around the world related to 1MalaysiaDevelopment Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia(1MDB). The firm evaluates progress toward satisfying thisobligation based on the report that it receives on a semi-annual basis, expected in February and August. Based onthe latest report as of August 2021, approximately$450 million in assets or proceeds from assets has beenreturned to the Government of Malaysia in connection withthis guarantee, which must be satisfied by August 18, 2025.Any amounts paid by the firm under this guarantee wouldbe subject to reimbursement in the event the assets orproceeds received by the Government of Malaysia throughAugust 18, 2028 exceeds $1.4 billion.

The firmdoes not consolidate these entities. See Note 14 for furtherinformation about the transactions involving GoldmanSachs Capital I and the APEX Trusts.The firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional\nguarantee of the securities issued by these entities. Timelypayment by the firm of amounts due to these entities underthe guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and relatedcontractual arrangements will be sufficient to coverpayments due on the securities issued by these entities. Nosubsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the securities ofGoldman Sachs Capital I or the APEX Trusts.\nManagement believes that it is unlikely that any\ncircumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on thepart of paying agents or other service providers, that wouldmake it necessary for the firm to make payments related tothese entities other than those required under the terms ofthe guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and relatedcontractual arrangements and in connection with certainexpenses incurred by these entities.\nIndemnities and Guarantees of Service Providers.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 20.\nRegulation and Capital Adequacy\nThe FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a BHC\nunder the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and afinancial holding company under amendments to this Act.The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capitalrequirements which are calculated in accordance with theregulations of the FRB (Capital Framework).\nThe capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital\nand leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatorycapital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets andoff-balance sheet exposures. Failure to comply with thesecapital requirements would result in restrictions beingimposed by the firm\u2019s regulators and could limit the firm\u2019sability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and makecertain discretionary compensation payments. The firm\u2019scapital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments bythe regulators about components of capital, risk weightingsand other factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm\u2019ssubsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capitalrequirements.\nCapital Framework\nThe regulations under the Capital Framework are largelybased on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s(Basel Committee) capital framework for strengtheninginternational capital standards (Basel III) and alsoimplement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.Under the Capital Framework, the firm is an \u201cAdvancedapproach\u201d banking organization and has been designatedas a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based\ncapital and the capital conservation buffer requirements.The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies asCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.\nThe firm calculates its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\nTotal capital ratios in accordance with both theStandardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Each of theratios calculated under the Standardized and AdvancedCapital Rules must meet its respective capital requirements.\nUnder the Capital Framework, the firm is also subject to\nleverage requirements which consist of a minimum Tier 1leverage ratio and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio(SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.Consolidated Regulatory Capital Requirements\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios. The table below presents the\nrisk-based capital requirements.\nStandardized Advanced\nAs of December 2021\nCET1 capital ratio 13.4% 9.5%\nTier 1 capital ratio 14.9% 11.0%\nTotal capital ratio 16.9% 13.0%\nAs of December 2020\nCET1 capital ratio 13.6% 9.5%\nTier 1 capital ratio 15.1% 11.0%Total capital ratio 17.1% 13.0%\nIn the table above:\n\u2030As of both December 2021 and December 2020, under\nboth the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules, theCET1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of4.5%, the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement includes aminimum of 6.0% and the Total capital ratiorequirement includes a minimum of 8.0%. Theserequirements also include the capital conservation bufferrequirements, consisting of the G-SIB surcharge of 2.5%(Method 2) and the countercyclical capital buffer, whichthe FRB has set to zero percent. In addition, the capitalconservation buffer requirements include the stresscapital buffer (SCB) of 6.4% as of December 2021 and6.6% as of December 2020 under the StandardizedCapital Rules and a buffer of 2.5% as of bothDecember 2021 and December 2020 under the AdvancedCapital Rules.\n\u2030The G-SIB surcharge is updated annually based on\nfinancial data from the prior year and is generallyapplicable for the following year. The G-SIB surcharge iscalculated using two methodologies, the higher of whichis reflected in the firm\u2019s risk-based capital requirements.The first calculation (Method 1) is based on the BaselCommittee\u2019s methodology which, among other factors,relies upon measures of the size, activity and complexityof each G-SIB. The second calculation (Method 2) usessimilar inputs but includes a measure of reliance on short-term wholesale funding.\n192 Goldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4053, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e78f026-1bcb-49b1-b0ab-5307e14c47cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e78f026-1bcb-49b1-b0ab-5307e14c47cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7830c96f-32a4-439b-9f20-1dcb25f2c896", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "68ec27544a7ea6ba80396bb551142b2af47f59231c7c4d49b8f2ac7f7f521040", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c30510e-0493-47d1-96fb-c748251af60a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "195", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "a6e4af8dba21d3106d0720ba5a518313d30d6523c0c43ff3c3703a17b0d07719", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f17558f-43a1-4943-9295-33eecc534576", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f9b3671a300d0f2bd0182738fa3e06a1ad8742a23b0ad7fbf15e82aa94e8493f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e5c7d5771e3fd3d609dfe6c63dea7b0e006c7a1c3bb6727eea5202fb8c802f94", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The exposure measures for derivatives andsecurities financing transactions are computed utilizinginternal models.\n\u2030For both Standardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the\nrisk-weights for securitizations and equities are based onspecific required formulaic approaches.\nMarket Risk\nRWAs for market risk in accordance with the Standardizedand Advanced Capital Rules are generally consistent.Market RWAs are calculated based on measures ofexposure which include the following:\n\u2030Value-at-Risk (VaR) is the potential loss in value of\ntrading assets and liabilities, as well as certaininvestments, loans, and other financial assets andliabilities accounted for at fair value, due to adversemarket movements over a defined time horizon with aspecified confidence level.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 195", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3214, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d572040a-ce35-409e-86fb-be77c7bf369a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d572040a-ce35-409e-86fb-be77c7bf369a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "199", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0de8387d-ac87-4a25-91b8-4bf721126e47", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "199", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "97a62392dd2f2ee9279f852652bf93983984438c3eed78c48d7197a864f84555", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29b6f682-9be5-49d4-aea0-f6f76b8dc4f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "198", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "125da07782c5d177c2c623956fd0721204bf080336c57751a89cb7903701147a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9290c342-5f80-41ad-80ce-87e9eff74fdc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ddae911889674d4304db7e803cf08977cfa6906a08934daea451f072f33ad3bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b2d9835681291f907191f1203f885fbc1bfab99e7dc6cbb9246fdc7d766ba0b5", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor both risk management purposes and regulatory capital\ncalculations, the firm uses a single VaR model whichcaptures risks, including those related to interest rates,equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices.However, VaR used for risk management purposes differsfrom VaR used for regulatory capital requirements(regulatory VaR) due to differences in time horizons,confidence levels and the scope of positions on which VaRis calculated. For risk management purposes, a 95%one-day VaR is used, whereas for regulatory capitalrequirements, a 99% 10-day VaR is used to determineMarket RWAs and a 99% one-day VaR is used todetermine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the dailynet revenues used to determine risk management VaRexceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to theVaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior businessday) include intraday activity, whereas the CapitalFramework requires that intraday activity be excluded fromdaily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaRexceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer netrevenues, which are more likely than not to be positive bytheir nature. As a result, there may be differences in thenumber of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily netrevenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to theamounts calculated for risk management VaR.\nThe firm\u2019s positional losses observed on a single day\nexceeded its 99% one-day regulatory VaR on one occasionduring 2021 and on six occasions during 2020 (all of whichoccurred during March 2020 and, as permitted by the FRB,did not have any impact on the firm\u2019s VaR multiplier usedto calculate Market RWAs);\n\u2030Stressed VaR is the potential loss in value of trading assets\nand liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, andother financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fairvalue, during a period of significant market stress;\n\u2030Incremental risk is the potential loss in value of\nnon-securitized positions due to the default or creditmigration of issuers of financial instruments over aone-year time horizon;\n\u2030Comprehensive risk is the potential loss in value, due to\nprice risk and defaults, within the firm\u2019s credit correlationpositions; and\n\u2030Specific risk is the risk of loss on a position that could\nresult from factors other than broad market movements,including event risk, default risk and idiosyncratic risk.The standardized measurement method is used todetermine specific risk RWAs, by applying supervisorydefined risk-weighting factors after applicable netting isperformed.Operational Risk\nOperational RWAs are only required to be included underthe Advanced Capital Rules.

As of the datehereof, the firm has estimated the upper end of the range ofreasonably possible aggregate loss for such matters and forany other matters described below where management hasbeen able to estimate a range of reasonably possibleaggregate loss to be approximately $2.0 billion in excess ofthe aggregate reserves for such matters.\nManagement is generally unable to estimate a range

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 29.\nEmployee Incentive Plans\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for a\nshare-based award is generally measured based on thegrant-date fair value of the award. Share-based awards thatdo not require future service (i.e., vested awards, includingawards granted to retirement-eligible employees) areexpensed immediately. Share-based awards that requirefuture service are amortized over the relevant serviceperiod. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur.\nCash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are generally\ncharged to retained earnings. If RSUs that require futureservice are forfeited, the related dividend equivalentsoriginally charged to retained earnings are reclassified tocompensation expense in the period in which forfeitureoccurs.\nThe firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon\ndelivery of share-based awards. In certain cases, primarilyrelated to conflicted employment (as outlined in theapplicable award agreements), the firm may cash settleshare-based compensation awards accounted for as equityinstruments. For these awards, whose terms allow for cashsettlement, additional paid-in capital is adjusted to theextent of the difference between the value of the award atthe time of cash settlement and the grant-date value of theaward.\nStock Incentive Plan\nThe firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The GoldmanSachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2021)(2021 SIP), which provides for grants of RSUs, restrictedstock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options,nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, andother share-based awards, each of which may be subject toterms and conditions, including performance or marketconditions. On April 29, 2021, shareholders approved the2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is a successor to several predecessorstock incentive plans, the first of which was adopted onApril 30, 1999, and each of which was approved by thefirm\u2019s shareholders.As of December 2021, 69.8 million shares were available to\nbe delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021SIP. If any shares of common stock underlying awardsgranted under the 2021 SIP or awards granted under the2018, 2015 or 2013 predecessor stock incentive plans arenot delivered because such awards are forfeited, terminatedor canceled, or if shares of common stock underlying suchawards are surrendered or withheld to satisfy anyobligation of the grantee (including taxes), those shares willbecome available to be delivered pursuant to awardsgranted under the 2021 SIP. Shares available to be deliveredunder the 2021 SIP also are subject to adjustment forcertain events or changes in corporate structure as providedunder the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is scheduled to terminateon the date of the annual meeting of shareholders thatoccurs in 2025.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject toperformance or market conditions) to employees, which aregenerally valued based on the closing price of theunderlying shares on the date of grant after taking intoaccount a liquidity discount for any applicable post-vestingand delivery transfer restrictions. The value of equityawards also considers the impact of material non-publicinformation, if any, that the firm expects to make availableshortly following grant. RSUs generally vest and underlyingshares of common stock deliver (net of requiredwithholding tax) as outlined in the applicable awardagreements. Award agreements generally provide thatvesting is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as onretirement, death, disability and, in certain cases, conflictedemployment. Delivery of the underlying shares of commonstock is conditioned on the grantees satisfying certainvesting and other requirements outlined in the awardagreements. RSUs not subject to performance conditionsgenerally vest and deliver over a three-year period.\nRSUs that are subject to performance or market conditions\ngenerally deliver after the end of a three to five year period.For awards that are subject to performance or marketconditions, generally the final award is adjusted from zeroup to 150% of the original grant based on satisfaction ofthose conditions. Dividend equivalents that accrue on theseawards are paid when the awards settle.\nGoldman Sachs 2021 Form 10-K 219", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4358, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aebe6e9c-1987-4c85-a5a5-4e85ea665623": {"__data__": {"id_": "aebe6e9c-1987-4c85-a5a5-4e85ea665623", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "223", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4267aa69-0621-4373-8863-2b6cf05be7a1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "223", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3a62f9cb9bdcae47beda575174cc163d67b4d4fb455e5d15c5184b1fd75c96fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "51abd8d6-884e-4288-be10-9594dac5d98e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "222", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "177ada74fddc8961b46b2e501af7db362573591428e5e4e2abde1a5a2afb8c03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff674c39-127f-44a5-8ded-48dd3e0cf207", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5daab725db91f9af1bf7c627d3a7e879e7bc12df501e1e458922e77a6163898f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ba4c87b99ef581ce008448f1c4bbcf620b0223adbc85b4924cdfa50c53da0632", "text": "THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The following summary does not purpor t to be complete and\nis qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of the Company\u2019 s restated certificate of incorporation and the Company\u2019 s amended and\nrestated by-laws, which are exhibits to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context otherwise provide s, all references to the\nCompany in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries.\nPursuant to the Company\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation, the Company\u2019s authorized capital stock consists of 4,350,000,0 00 shares, each with a\npar value of $0.01 per share, of which 4,000,000,000 shares are designated as common stock and 200,000,000 shares are designate d as nonvoting\ncommon stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its hol ders have paid their\npurchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds.\nThe Company\u2019s Shareholders\u2019 Agreement governs, among other things, the voting of shares of common stock owned by participating managing\ndirectors of the Company. Shares of common stock subject to the Company\u2019s Shareholders\u2019 Agreement are called \u201cvoting shares.\u201d B efore any of the\nCompany\u2019s shareholders vote, a separate, preliminary vote is held by the persons covered by the Company\u2019s Shareholders\u2019 Agreeme nt. In the election of\ndirectors, all voting shares will be voted in favor of the election of the director nominees receiving the highest numbers of v otes cast by the covered\npersons in the preliminary vote. For all other matters, all voting shares will be voted in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by the covered\npersons in the preliminary vote.\nCommon Stock\nEach holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share owned of record on all matters submitted to a vote of shareh olders. There are no\ncumulative voting rights. Accordingly, the holders of a plurality of the shares of common stock voting in a contested election of directors can elect all\nthe directors if they choose to do so, subject to any voting rights of holders of preferred stock to elect directors. In an unc ontested director election, a\ndirector must receive a majority of the votes cast for or against the director to be elected.\nSubject to the preferential rights of any holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, the holders of common stock, to gether with the holders of\nthe nonvoting common stock, are entitled to such dividends and distributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as may be d eclared from time to\ntime by the Company\u2019s board of directors from legally available funds. Subject to the preferential rights of holders of any out standing series of preferred\nstock, upon the Company\u2019s liquidation, dissolution or winding up and after payment of all prior claims, the holders of common s tock, with the shares of\nthe common stock and the nonvoting common stock being considered as a single class for this purpose, will be entitled to receiv e pro rata  all the\nCompany\u2019s assets. Holders of common stock have no redemption or conversion rights or preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe  for securities of the\nCompany.\nNonvoting Common Stock\nThe nonvoting common stock has the same rights and privileges as, ranks equally and shares proportionately with, and is identic al in all respects as to\nall matters to, the common stock, except that the nonvoting common stock has no voting rights other than those voting rights re quired by law.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law\nThe Company is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohib its a publicly held\nDelaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years aft er the date of the\ntransaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed m anner.

those who own depositary shares reg istered in their own\nnames, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for this purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial i nterests in depositary\nshares registered in street name or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company.\nGeneral\nThe Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000 th ownership\ninterest in a share of Series A Preferred Stock and evidenced by a depositary receipt. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock r epresented by depositary\nshares are deposited under a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the depos itary receipts\nevidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share is entitled,  through the depositary, in\nproportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the r ights and preferences of the\nSeries A Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights).\nDividends and Other Distributions\nThe depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Series A Pre ferred Stock to the record\nholders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shar es held by the holders. The\ndepositary will distribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to t hose distributions, unless it\ndetermines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make a distrib ution. In that event, the\ndepositary may, with the Company\u2019s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in\nproportion to the number of depositary shares they hold.\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the correspon ding record dates for the\nSeries A Preferred Stock.\nThe amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositar y or by the Company on\naccount of taxes or other governmental charges.\nRedemption of Depositary Shares\nIf the Company redeems the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, the depositary shares will be redeeme d from the proceeds\nreceived by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption  price per depositary\nshare will be equal to 1/1,000 th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (or $25 per depositary share).\nWhenever the Company redeems shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the s ame redemption date,\nthe number of depositary shares representing shares of Series A Preferred Stock so redeemed.\n \n-11-", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4819, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bcdac7b-bbc9-4e6d-b179-b24e7fe86313": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bcdac7b-bbc9-4e6d-b179-b24e7fe86313", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "249", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d671601-8b03-463c-bc6d-48710d2290fe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "249", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b72c61a4356ff7cc3257411796256c2f4f3df34b69d30cb4ad2897dac04d4042", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "207d4c74-e258-4d9f-a877-9cf1e37dc94c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "7e5a760ef2a8b04ab5158d4d4a701a172ed1d710fddcecdeec3b5bd2de9a2a2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "87e63d07-1f4f-4b03-90b7-3c7f978de755", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "19cf2faff0a47c37deeb071296380cb03a4b8bedefe25c8390a860476fb60e5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "069e9a99e6ba8f7308959fc453bad6e7a081137d7b5d429820032e09192d2bde", "text": "In case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be s elected by the depositary\npro rata  or in such other manner determined by the depositary to be equitable.

istered in their own\nnames, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for this purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial i nterests in depositary\nshares registered in street name or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company.\nGeneral\nThe Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000 th ownership\ninterest in a share of Series C Preferred Stock and evidenced by a depositary receipt. The shares of Series C Preferred Stock r epresented by depositary\nshares are deposited under a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the depos itary receipts\nevidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share is entitled,  through the depositary, in\nproportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series C Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the r ights and preferences of the\nSeries C Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights).\nDividends and Other Distributions\nThe depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Series C Pre ferred Stock to the record\nholders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shar es held by the holders. The\ndepositary will distribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to t hose distributions, unless it\ndetermines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make a distrib ution. In that event, the\ndepositary may, with the Company\u2019s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in\nproportion to the number of depositary shares they hold.\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the correspon ding record dates for the\nSeries C Preferred Stock.\nThe amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositar y or by the Company on\naccount of taxes or other governmental charges.\nRedemption of Depositary Shares\nIf the Company redeems the Series C Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, the depositary shares will be redeeme d from the proceeds\nreceived by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption  price per depositary\nshare will be equal to 1/1,000 th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock (or $25 per depositary share).\nWhenever the Company redeems shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the s ame redemption date,\nthe number of depositary shares representing shares of Series C Preferred Stock so redeemed.\n \n-19-", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4793, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f50e586-67d1-4ba1-b3b6-89bed988b997": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f50e586-67d1-4ba1-b3b6-89bed988b997", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "257", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "782f08eb-6828-4790-9c82-02890a8c2f8f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "257", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0ca95d61847b5e216ac5c598668720ccbb8602cd997a0c08a7617d241ea83e8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9148c5e3-043e-4270-bbac-bb781043fcc1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "256", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "04375606c1deda7a55c8a45f4e8b04c00ca1545d3c68d2d3b940664abe8f4584", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "32293229-ac87-4e0c-8fb4-2548a53fc975", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6a75afaa56dcf22ca717c2c4432c05acb8b1b24a8f931025830dfedaf0d9873", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "437f00dacd30e6bdd923f544d7d674a38b1b6e08e96ba07c5c30b59237f41989", "text": "In case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be s elected by the depositary\npro rata  or in such other manner determined by the depositary to be equitable.

istered in their own\nnames, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for this purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial i nterests in depositary\nshares registered in street name or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company.\nGeneral\nThe Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000 th ownership\ninterest in a share of Series D Preferred Stock and evidenced by a depositary receipt. The shares of Series D Preferred Stock r epresented by depositary\nshares are deposited under a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the depos itary receipts\nevidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share is entitled,  through the depositary, in\nproportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series D Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the r ights and preferences of the\nSeries D Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights).\nDividends and Other Distributions\nThe depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Series D Pre ferred Stock to the record\nholders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series D Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shar es held by the holders. The\ndepositary will distribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to t hose distributions, unless it\ndetermines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make a distrib ution. In that event, the\ndepositary may, with the Company\u2019s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in\nproportion to the number of depositary shares they hold.\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the correspon ding record dates for the\nSeries D Preferred Stock.\nThe amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositar y or by the Company on\naccount of taxes or other governmental charges.\nRedemption of Depositary Shares\nIf the Company redeems the Series D Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, the depositary shares will be redeeme d from the proceeds\nreceived by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption  price per depositary\nshare will be equal to 1/1,000 th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock (or $25 per depositary share).\nWhenever the Company redeems shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the s ame redemption date,\nthe number of depositary shares representing shares of Series D Preferred Stock so redeemed.\n \n-27-", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4793, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ffa4d85-71a9-4915-8e72-1f7edf92080a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ffa4d85-71a9-4915-8e72-1f7edf92080a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2dbe518f-b6f6-4b50-892f-bb2deef552e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0cfd0aea3a4b46dc91fbb3296170d7f847adcf27020ec36c47c176c481f13ace", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae364d20-66b5-409c-a554-e0cdd8708e13", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "264", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "bcb10985b32ae34818dda266cda5eda91784d37e2ecc1bfe4473f7dd550b1521", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff4d8c87-9efd-4775-93d6-93450c1357be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a56f2c2de9f18dc98067bd691e85c81f034ee2233f2a55a8cfea14ef28dfcfd7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e74788999725e8653903c938c1ff957d0bdbb010730cfe0408e9825d4ea2bb5e", "text": "In case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be s elected by the depositary\npro rata  or in such other manner determined by the depositary to be equitable.

The Trust in respect of Capital II holds the  Company\u2019 s Perpetual\nNon-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E (the \u201cSeries E Preferred Stock\u201d), and the Trust in respect of Capital III holds the Co mpany\u2019 s Perpetual\nNon-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series F (the \u201cSeries F Preferred Stock,\u201d and collectively with the Series E Preferred Stock, t he \u201cPreferred\u201d).\nEach holder of APEX has a beneficial interest in the relevant Trust but does not own any specific shares of the Preferred held by that Trust.

A principal difference between the rights of a holder of a Tru st security and a holder of\nPreferred is that a holder of Preferred would be entitled to receive from the issuer the dividends, redemption payments and pay ment upon liquidation in\nrespect of Preferred while a holder of Trust securities is entitled to receive distributions from a Trust, or from the Company under a Guarantee, if and to\nthe extent the Trust has funds available for the payment of such distributions.\nRights upon Dissolution\nUpon any voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Trust, holders of each series of APEX will receive the distributions descr ibed under \u201c\u2014\nLiquidation Distribution upon Dissolution\u201d above. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy of the Company, t he holders of the\nPreferred would be preferred shareholders of the Company, entitled to the preferences upon liquidation described under \u201cDescrip tion of the Preferred\u201d\nbelow. Since the Company is the guarantor under the Guarantee and has agreed to pay for all costs, expenses and liabilities of the Trust, other than the\nTrust\u2019s obligations to the holders of the Trust securities, the positions of a holder of APEX relative to other creditors and t o the Company\u2019s shareholders\nin the event of liquidation or bankruptcy are expected to be substantially the same as if that holder held the corresponding as sets of the Trust directly.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\nThe following is a brief description of the terms of the Preferred held by the relevant Trust. This summary does not purport to  be complete and is subject\nto and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company\u2019 s restated certificate of incorporation, which is an exhibit to th e Annual Report of which this\nexhibit is a part.\nGeneral\nThe Company\u2019s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (including the  Preferred).\nShares of the Preferred rank senior to the Company\u2019s common stock, equally with each other series of the Company\u2019s preferred st ock outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2020, and at least equally with each other series of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any se nior series that may be\nissued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Preferred), with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up. The Preferred is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase  price in full and that the\nCompany may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Holders of the Preferred do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more\npreferred stock of the Company. The Preferred is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series  of stock or other securities\nof the Company. The Preferred has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase\nthe Preferred.\nThe Preferred has a fixed liquidation preference of $100,000 per share. If the Company liquidates, dissolves or winds up its af fairs, holders of the\nPreferred will be entitled to receive, out of the Company\u2019s assets that are available for distribution to shareholders, an amou nt per share equal to the\nliquidation preference per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without regard to any undeclared dividends.\nUnless the Trust is dissolved prior to the redemption of the Preferred, holders of APEX will not receive shares of the Preferre d, and their interest in the\nPreferred will be represented by their APEX. If the Trust is dissolved, the Company may elect to distribute depositary shares r epresenting the Preferred\ninstead of fractional shares. Since the Preferred is held by the Property Trustee, holders of APEX are only able to exercise vo ting or other rights with\nrespect to the Preferred through the Property Trustee.\n \n-56-", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4330, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41b83561-615c-4c2a-9547-a117d64a4731": {"__data__": {"id_": "41b83561-615c-4c2a-9547-a117d64a4731", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "294", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "60415db6-eb27-45ab-8cb3-1e36582d6969", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "294", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "214f998280555b00b18be5935da60d5073cd8cb30887d5726135b03e01099b24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b60d2fb3-1f25-4101-94ec-faacebe14075", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "293", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "477c1a4c075d19f3c8cab1147eeb6ffccab96f5936a4da2466c9fcd2b36384f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ebba29e8-9cf6-4b9c-a49b-e8b73845d5ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c962b595a0e700ed998aef80325ec1d9c89bddd3d42db731256552268602a0fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "847ccebf538d979c49fc25680e5144b4f2b3d8be78616532aca77cb54ef46371", "text": "Dividends\nDividends on shares of the Preferred are not mandatory.

In certain limited circumstances, only the trustee will be entitled to set a record d ate for action by holders. If\nGSFC, the Company or the trustee set a record date for an approval or other action to be taken by holders, that vote or action may be taken only by\npersons or entities who are holders on the record date and must be taken during the period that GSFC specifies for this purpose , or that the trustee\nspecifies if it sets the record date.

In addition, record dates for a ny global debt security\nmay be set in accordance with procedures established by the depositary from time to time. Accordingly, record dates for global debt securities may differ\nfrom those for other debt securities.\nForm of Callable Notes\nThe Callable Notes are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company and represented by a global note.

This description is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Senior Debt Indenture, dated as of O ctober 10, 2008, among\nGSFC, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemen tal Indenture, dated\nas of February 20, 2015 (collectively, the \u201cGSFC 2008 Indenture\u201d), which are exhibits to the Annual Report of which this exhibi t is a part.

The Medium-Term Notes, Series E are a single, distinct series of debt securities. GSFC may, however,  issue notes in such\namounts, at such times and on such terms as GSFC wishes. The notes of the Medium-Term Notes, Series E may differ from one anoth er, and from other\nseries, in their terms.\nIn this description, references to a series of debt securities mean a series issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, such as the notes issued under GSFC\u2019 s\nMedium-Term Notes, Series E program.\nTerms of the Index-Linked Notes\nAs noted above, the Index-Linked Notes are part of a series of debt securities, entitled \u201cMedium-Term Notes, Series E,\u201d that GS FC may issue under the\nGSFC 2008 Indenture from time to time.

If at least two such quotations are\nprovided, 3-month USD LIBOR for such London business day will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations.\n \n \u2022  If fewer than two quotations are provided as requested, 3-month USD LIBOR for such London business day will be the arithmetic  mean of\nthe rates quoted by major banks in New York City, selected by the calculation agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City  time, on\nsuch London business day for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a period of three months commencing in two Lon don\nbusiness days and in a representative amount.\n \n \u2022  If no quotation is provided, then the calculation agent, after consulting such sources as it deems comparable to any of the f oregoing\nquotations or display page, or any such source as it deems reasonable from which to estimate 3-month USD LIBOR or any of theforegoing lending rates, shall determine 3-month USD LIBOR for the applicable day in its sole discretion.\nFor the purposes of the previous paragraph, \u201crepresentative amount\u201d means an amount that is representative for a single transac tion in the relevant\nmarket at the relevant time.\nClosing level of the index: as described below under \u201c\u2014 Special Calculation Provisions \u2014 Closing Level of the Index\u201d\n \n-75-", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4413, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f378a13-3283-48fc-9d25-edc25501e1b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f378a13-3283-48fc-9d25-edc25501e1b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "313", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7d011995-5aef-46bc-924a-497d7990c490", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "313", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "71be5f73fd3933032d372bfd195004bac356b893e1162aa43d098c832434a428", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "47b60e0a-ff3f-4b65-bcdd-987d9e86dc16", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "312", "file_name": "GS2021.pdf", "file_path": "data\\GS\\GS2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2184627, "creation_date": "2023-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-28", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "71342c981fb98778d1eb6153826536886bab707a864dbe9c31f402f5ec7bf3e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f467409a-eb47-4f56-a71c-3863e0a15616", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ea3e0d05f7c19b961f24d00c71cebfc41c2c55cf8f5be26508b64887372ded7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0605effc065e76a85bcbeb41c9ff2e8fd10ba053408da129d8c6d4a4277de09f", "text": "Intraday level of the index: as described below under \u201c\u2014 Special Calculation Provisions \u2014 Intraday Level of the Index\u201d\nInception date: March 29, 2018\nInitial valuation date: the inception date\nFinal valuation date : March 29, 2028, unless the calculation agent determines that a market disruption event occurs or is continuing on that day or  that\nday is not otherwise a trading day.

These changes are limited t o clarifications and\nchanges that would not adversely affect any debt securities of any series in any material respect.

Also, GSFC will count only outstanding debt se curities in determining\nwhether the various percentage requirements for taking action have been met.

LLC, is the owner.\nDetermining Record Dates for Action by Holders\nGSFC and the Company will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders that  are entitled to take\naction under a particular debt indenture. In certain limited circumstances, only the trustee will be entitled to set a record d ate for action by holders. If\nGSFC, the Company or the trustee set a record date for an approval or other action to be taken by holders, that vote or action may be taken only by\npersons or entities who are holders on the record date and must be taken during the period that GSFC specifies for this purpose , or that the trustee\nspecifies if it sets the record date.
