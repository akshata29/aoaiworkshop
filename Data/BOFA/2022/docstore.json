As part of its CCAR, the Federal \nReserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using \nhypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal \nReserve.

Risk Factors \u2013 Liquidity on page 9. \nInsolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority\nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may be \nappointed receiver of an insured depository institution if it is \ninsolvent or in certain other circumstances. In addition, under \nthe Financial Reform Act, when a systemically important \nfinancial institution (SIFI) such as the Corporation is in default or \ndanger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in order \nto conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution. In the event \nof such appointment, the FDIC could, among other things, \ninvoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. \nBankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain \nfinancial distress and systemic risk determinations. The orderly \nliquidation authority is modeled in part on the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Act, but also adopts certain concepts from the U.S. \nBankruptcy Code.\nThe orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences \nfrom the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For example, in certain \ncircumstances, the FDIC could permit payment of obligations it \ndetermines to be systemically significant (e.g., short-term \ncreditors or operating creditors) in lieu of paying other \nobligations (e.g., long-term creditors) without the need to obtain \ncreditors\u2019 consent or prior court review. The insolvency and \nresolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total \nelimination of the value of a BHC\u2019s outstanding equity, as well \nas impairment or elimination of certain debt.\nUnder the FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy for resolving \nSIFIs, the FDIC could replace a distressed BHC with a bridge \nholding company, which could continue operations and result in \nan orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity is \nheld solely for the benefit of creditors of the original BHC.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve requires that BHCs \nmaintain minimum levels of long-term debt required to provide \nadequate loss absorbing capacity in the event of a resolution.\nFor more information regarding our resolution, see Item 1A. \nRisk Factors \u2013 Liquidity on page 9.\nBank of America  6", "start_char_idx": 3975, "end_char_idx": 7263, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6b01e2f-d49a-4189-94fb-56f669cbbfda": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6b01e2f-d49a-4189-94fb-56f669cbbfda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "97a45d88-a96f-4ab4-ae94-a6787a44e5d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d6ee17a861f921ac927522d7e73f46096505197351f720e73e84551ed4be5c24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "54760776-5740-4f2f-8bac-5de7d78d89aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "77cf76beabacc9ef56a9d3118410a27d7f405ff37bb68e2ae8500a7c22cf91d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2aa1963-27b7-4d58-80ef-deb0d517ad67", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "794009511098fdc93431be88c59ecd1819ee5ea776f098cf749420d0d2fcf8db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5f829349d2e8900d64cf765f9bb298567c59739517bf6aba8bfd84b6a7d0d154", "text": "Limitations on Acquisitions\nThe Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act \nof 1994 permits a BHC to acquire banks located in states other \nthan its home state without regard to state law, subject to \ncertain conditions, including the condition that the BHC, after \nand as a result of the acquisition, controls no more than 10 \npercent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository \ninstitutions in the U.S. and no more than 30 percent or such \nlesser or greater amount set by state law of such deposits in \nthat state. At June 30, 2022, we held greater than 10 percent \nof the total amount of deposits of insured depository \ninstitutions in the U.S.\nIn addition, the Financial Reform Act restricts acquisitions by \na financial institution if, as a result of the acquisition, the total \nliabilities of the financial institution would exceed 10 percent of \nthe total liabilities of all financial institutions in the U.S. At June \n30, 2022, our liabilities did not exceed 10 percent of the total \nliabilities of all financial institutions in the U.S.\nThe Volcker Rule\nThe Volcker Rule prohibits insured depository institutions and \ncompanies affiliated with insured depository institutions \n(collectively, banking entities) from engaging in short-term \nproprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity \nfutures and options for their own account. The Volcker Rule also \nimposes limits on banking entities\u2019 investments in, and other \nrelationships with, hedge funds and private equity funds. The \nVolcker Rule provides exemptions for certain activities, including \nmarket making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government \nobligations, insurance company activities and organizing and \noffering hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule \nalso clarifies that certain activities are not prohibited, including \nacting as agent, broker or custodian. A banking entity with \nsignificant trading operations, such as the Corporation, is \nrequired to maintain a detailed compliance program to comply \nwith the restrictions of the Volcker Rule. \nDerivatives\nOur derivatives operations are subject to extensive regulation \nglobally.

These regulations are already in \neffect in many markets in which we operate. \nIn addition, many G-20 jurisdictions, including the U.S., U.K., \nand Japan, have adopted resolution stay regulations to address \nconcerns that the close-out of derivatives and other financial \ncontracts in resolution could impede orderly resolution of G-\nSIBs, and additional jurisdictions are expected to follow suit. In \naddition, the EU has implemented EU-wide resolution stay \nrequirements. Generally, these resolution stay regulations \nrequire amendment of certain financial contracts to provide for \ncontractual   recognition  of  stays  of  termination  rights  under various statutory resolution regimes and a stay on the exercise \nof cross-default rights based on an affiliate\u2019s entry into \ninsolvency proceedings.

Pursuant to these arrangements, if Bank of \nAmerica Corporation\u2019s liquidity resources deteriorate so severely \nthat resolution becomes imminent, it will no longer be able to \ndraw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to \ncontribute its remaining financial assets to a wholly-owned \nholding company subsidiary.

For \nexample, based on CCAR 2022 stress test results, our SCB \nincreased 90 bps to 3.4 percent on October 1, 2022. \nA significant component of regulatory capital ratios is \ncalculating our RWA and our leverage exposure, which may \nincrease.

It is expected in 2023 that U.S. banking regulators \nwill propose updates to the U.S. capital framework to \nincorporate the Basel Committee revisions. Economic \ndisruptions or events may also cause an increase in our balance \nsheet, RWA or leverage exposures, increasing required \nregulatory  capital and liquidity amounts.\nChanges to and compliance with the regulatory capital and \nliquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us \nto liquidate assets, increase borrowings, issue additional equity \nor other securities, reduce the amount of common stock \nrepurchases or dividends, cease or alter certain operations and \nbusiness activities or hold highly liquid assets, which may \nadversely affect our results of operations. \nChanges in accounting standards or assumptions in applying \naccounting policies could adversely affect us.\nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we \nrecord and report our financial condition and results of \noperations.

If we are \nunable to continue to attract, develop and retain qualified \nindividuals, our business prospects and competitive position \ncould be adversely affected.\nBank of America  22", "start_char_idx": 4331, "end_char_idx": 7723, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c83b6027-8e57-482d-8f19-784c6f6da10e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c83b6027-8e57-482d-8f19-784c6f6da10e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2949c141-19ac-40f2-ab18-c94f1afba7a9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "74358a0ef165d65b3149c264aeb6d1bae1029ff5d5532f60af2fd636b36fd7eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "267f32b6-2d41-43b4-8ce3-cb7cd7a17f3e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3fb3d222b8520e03adde94fe2af7c2dfdf4bee8f3a73a3b88d922459131db63f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "58790915-abd6-4631-ae6e-a4f2a10dee4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e4ad715609ad2f710ecb023bf07532f05be5859e944b62a2e1e037a143409e6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "41127c8339170d6454ba777479ccf7a74e8c0731b2201157b5d6b5f905e51b3e", "text": "Item 1B.

The remaining USD \nLIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six \nmonth and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative \nimmediately after June 30, 2023, although the Financial \nConduct Authority (FCA) has issued a consultation seeking views \non whether to compel publication of the one-month, three-month \nand six-month USD LIBOR settings on a \u201csynthetic\u201d basis for a \nshort time after June 30, 2023 (i.e., through September 30, \n2024). Separately, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation (FDIC) issued supervisory guidance encouraging \nbanks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR \nas a reference rate by December 31, 2021, subject to certain \nregulatory-approved exceptions (USD LIBOR Guidance).\nAs a result, a major transition has been and continues to be \nin progress in the global financial markets with respect to the \nreplacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs). This has been \nand continues to be a complex process impacting a variety of \nour businesses and operations. IBORs have historically been \nused in many of the Corporation\u2019s products and contracts, \nincluding derivatives, consumer and commercial loans, \nmortgages, floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate \nproducts and financial instruments. In response, the \nCorporation established an enterprise-wide IBOR transition \nprogram, with active involvement of senior management and \nregular reports to the Management Risk Committee (MRC) and \nEnterprise Risk Committee (ERC). The program continues to \ndrive the Corporation's industry and regulatory engagement, \nclient and financial contract changes, internal and external \ncommunications, technology and operations modifications, \nincluding updates to its operational models, systems and \nprocesses, introduction of new products, migration of existing \nclients, and program strategy and governance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Corporation transitioned or \notherwise addressed IBOR-based products and contracts \nreferencing the rates that ceased or became non-representative \nafter December 31, 2021, including LIBOR-linked commercial \nloans, LIBOR-based adjustable-rate consumer mortgages, \nLIBOR-linked derivatives and interdealer trading of certain USD \nLIBOR and other interest rate swaps, and related hedging \narrangements. Additionally, in accordance with the USD LIBOR \nGuidance, the Corporation has ceased entering into new \ncontracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate, subject to \nlimited exceptions, including those consistent with supervisory \nguidance.\nThe Corporation launched capabilities and services to \nsupport the issuance of and trading in products indexed to \nvarious alternative reference rates (ARRs) and developed \nemployee training programs as well as other internal and \nexternal sources of information on the various challenges and \nopportunities that the replacement of IBORs has presented and \ncontinues to present.

The decrease in net income was primarily due to an \nincrease in provision for credit losses, lower noninterest income \nand higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net \ninterest income. \nFor discussion and analysis of our consolidated and \nbusiness segment results of operations for 2021 compared to \n2020, see Financial Highlights and Business Segment \nOperations sections in the  MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $9.5 billion to $52.5 billion in \n2022 compared to 2021. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-\nequivalent (FTE) basis increased 30 basis points (bps) to 1.96 \npercent for 2022. The increase was primarily driven by benefits \nfrom higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization \nexpense, and loan growth, partially offset by a lower amount of \naccelerated net capitalized loan fees due to Paycheck Protection \nProgram (PPP) loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in \n2021.

For more information on the loan \nportfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 59.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses increased $295 million \nprimarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic \noutlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced \npandemic uncertainties . For more information, see Allowance for \nCredit Losses on page 73.\nAll Other Assets\nAll other assets decreased $12.5 billion primarily driven by a \ndecline in margin loans and loans held-for-sale (LHFS).\nLiabilities\nAt December\u00a031, 2022, total liabilities were approximately $2.8 \ntrillion, down $121.3 billion from December\u00a031, 2021, primarily \ndue to lower deposits.\nDeposits\nDeposits decreased $134.1 billion primarily due to an increase \nin customer spending and a shift to higher yielding accounts.\nFederal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold \nUnder Agreements to Repurchase\nFederal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances \non a short-term basis. Securities loaned or sold under \nagreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing \ntransactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, \nearn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance \nsheet. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold \nunder agreements to repurchase increased $3.3 billion primarily \ndriven by an increase in repurchase agreements to support \nliquidity.\nTrading Account Liabilities\nTrading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in \nequity and fixed-income securities including U.S. Treasury and \nagency securities, non-U.S. sovereign debt and corporate \nsecurities. Trading account liabilities decreased $20.3 billion \nprimarily due to lower levels of short positions within Global \nMarkets .Short-term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and \nprimarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term \nborrowings, notes payable and various other borrowings that \ngenerally have maturities of one year or less. Short-term \nborrowings increased $3.2 billion primarily due to an increase in \nFHLB advances and commercial paper to manage liquidity \nneeds. For more information on short-term borrowings, see Note \n10 \u2013 Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, \nCollateral and Restricted Cash  to the Consolidated Financial \nStatements.\nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt decreased $4.1 billion primarily due to \nmaturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments, partially \noffset by issuances. For more information on long-term debt, \nsee Note 11 \u2013 Long-term Debt  to the Consolidated Financial \nStatements.\nAll Other Liabilities\nAll other liabilities increased $30.8 billion primarily driven by \nGlobal Markets client activity.\nShareholders\u2019 Equity\nShareholders\u2019 equity increased $3.1 billion primarily due to net \nincome and the issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by \nmarket value decreases on derivatives and debt securities, and \nreturns of capital to shareholders through common and \npreferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases.\nCash Flows Overview\nThe Corporation\u2019s operating assets and liabilities support our \nglobal markets and lending activities. We believe that cash \nflows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to \ngenerate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to \nfund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities \nprimarily include the debt securities portfolio and loans and \nleases. Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily \nrelated to customer deposits, securities financing agreements, \nlong-term debt and common and preferred stock.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items \nor otherwise include components that differ from the most \ndirectly comparable measures calculated in accordance with \nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional \nuseful information to assess our financial condition, results of \noperations (including period-to-period operating performance) or \ncompliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These \nnon-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute \nfor GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or \ncalculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used \nby other companies.\nWe view net interest income and related ratios and analyses \non an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis \nare non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net \ninterest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an \nequivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in \nincome tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use \nthe federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative \nstate tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis \npoints we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest \nincome on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these \nitems on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from \nboth taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with \nindustry practices.\nWe may present certain key performance indicators and \nratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment \n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial \nmeasures. We believe that the presentation of measures that \nexclude these items is useful because such measures provide \nadditional information to assess the underlying operational \nperformance and trends of our businesses and to allow better \ncomparison of period-to-period operating performance.\nWe also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that \nutilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible \nequity represents shareholders\u2019 equity or common \nshareholders\u2019 equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets \n(excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related \ndeferred tax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d shareholders\u2019 equity or \ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity). These measures are used to \nevaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship \nand investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity and return on average tangible \nshareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to support our overall \ngrowth objectives. These ratios are:\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity \nmeasures our net income applicable to common \nshareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common \nshareholders\u2019 equity. The tangible common equity ratio \nrepresents adjusted ending common shareholders\u2019 equity \ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\u25cf Return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity measures \nour net income as a percentage of adjusted average total \nshareholders\u2019 equity. The tangible equity ratio represents \nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity divided by total \ntangible assets.\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted \nending common shareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending \ncommon shares outstanding.\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional \nuseful information because they present measures of those \nassets that can generate income. Tangible book value per \ncommon share provides additional useful information about the \nlevel of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of \ncommon stock.\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and performance \nmeasures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.\nFor more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP \nfinancial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial \nmeasures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 85.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance \nindicators (key performance indicators) that management uses \nwhen assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We \nbelieve they are useful to investors because they provide \nadditional information about our underlying operational \nperformance and trends. These key performance indicators \n(KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as \nsimilar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how \nthese metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 167. \nOur consolidated key performance indicators, which include \nvarious equity and credit metrics, are presented in

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE \nbasis. The primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and All Other  are shown below.\nWe periodically review capital allocated to our businesses \nand allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital \nplanning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers \nthe effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to \ninternal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based \ncapital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating \neach segment\u2019s credit, market, interest rate, business and \noperational risk components. For more information on the \nnature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 46. The \ncapital allocated to the business segments is referred to as \nallocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is \ncomprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of \ngoodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting \nunit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting \nunit, see Note 7 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets  to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements.For more information on our presentation of financial \ninformation on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data \non page\u00a0 32, and for reconciliations to consolidated total \nrevenue, net income and year-end total assets, see  Note 23 \u2013 \nBusiness Segment Information  to the Consolidated Financial \nStatements.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance \nindicators that management uses when evaluating segment \nresults.

Both periods included income \ntax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of \ncertain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global \nMarkets .\nManaging Risk\nRisk is inherent in all our business activities. Sound risk \nmanagement enables us to serve our customers and deliver for \nour shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in \nfinancial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage \nto our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability \nto execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive \napproach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework \nand an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved \nannually by the ERC and the Board.\nThe seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are \nstrategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and \nreputational.\n\u25cf Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial \ncondition arising from incorrect assumptions about external \nor internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective \nbusiness strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely \nmanner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or \ncompetitive environments in the geographic locations in \nwhich we operate.\n\u25cf Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or \nfailure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.\n\u25cf Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions \nadversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or \notherwise negatively impact earnings. Market risk is \ncomposed of price risk and interest rate risk.\n\u25cf Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected \ncash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support \nour businesses and customers under a range of economic \nconditions.\n\u25cf Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, \nmaterial financial loss or damage to the reputation of the \nCorporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to \ncomply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and \nregulations and our internal policies and procedures.\n\u25cf Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate \nor failed internal processes or systems, people or external \nevents.\n\u25cf Reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the \nCorporation may adversely impact  profitability or operations.\nThe following sections address in more detail the specific \nprocedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of \nrisk. This discussion of managing risk focuses on the current \nRisk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was \napproved by the ERC and the Board.\nAs set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing \nrisk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose, and how \nwe drive Responsible Growth. It requires us to focus on risk in \nall activities and encourages the necessary mindset and \nbehavior to enable effective risk management and promote \nsound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of \nmanaging risk well throughout the organization is critical to the \nsuccess of the Corporation and is a clear expectation of our \nexecutive management team and the Board.Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the \nconsistent and effective management of risks facing the \nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and \nresponsibilities for the management of risk and provides a \nblueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to \ncommittees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite \nand associated limits for our activities. \nExecutive management assesses, with Board oversight, the \nrisk-adjusted returns of each business. Management reviews \nand approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well \nas the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and \nrecommends them annually to the Board for approval. Our \nstrategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and \nfinancial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk \nappetite. Management sets financial objectives for each \nbusiness by allocating capital and setting a target for return on \ncapital for each business. Capital allocations and operating \nlimits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance \nprocesses as the businesses and the economic environment in \nwhich we operate continue to evolve. For more information \nregarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations \non page 37.\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk appetite indicates the amount of \ncapital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to \nachieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent \nwith applicable regulatory requirements.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4932, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fda6094-2a7c-4118-91c5-ceee54307092": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fda6094-2a7c-4118-91c5-ceee54307092", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5916cbc8-290a-4951-a594-bb855d0bcad0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "294ce469fd260ea0755c51699db0e1315d7242b4ed101eb8550a243fa1e8146c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4526854-3fb7-45e6-ada2-c97d617b5109", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d993711f71823703843fda91287bb6457fdcd1cdd1e9eda50109a15e5c91cb48", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "57fdbaf3-4e84-40c2-8739-a38b2ab1766c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfb53c47ac038c12e1bac41c49cc8cc0cb746e993359e3003613f32af56e540b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "50f325509a221a50c18daf6701c2f2cd86b59c9c17a24c1fc14c730ecdfb4286", "text": "Management reviews \nand approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well \nas the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and \nrecommends them annually to the Board for approval.

Our risk appetite \nprovides a common framework that includes a set of measures \nto assist senior management and the Board in assessing the \nCorporation\u2019s risk profile against our risk appetite and risk \ncapacity. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk \nAppetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements \nand quantitative limits.\nOur overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we \nprioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and \nflexible financial position so we can withstand challenging \neconomic conditions and take advantage of organic growth \nopportunities. Therefore, we set objectives and targets for \ncapital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to \noperate in a safe and sound manner at all times, including \nduring periods of stress. \nOur lines of business operate with risk limits that align with \nthe Corporation\u2019s risk appetite. Senior management is \nresponsible for tracking and reporting performance \nmeasurements as well as any exceptions to risk appetite limits. \nThe Board, and its committees when appropriate, oversee \nfinancial performance, execution of the strategic and financial \noperating plans, adherence to risk appetite limits and the \nadequacy of internal controls. \nFor a more detailed discussion of our risk management \nactivities, see the discussion below and pages 49 through 82.\nRisk Management Governance\nThe Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby \nthe Board and its committees may delegate authority to \nmanagement-level committees or executive officers. Such \ndelegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval \nfunctions, which may be evidenced in documents such as \ncommittee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and \nresolutions.\nThe chart below illustrates the interrelationship among the \nBoard, Board committees and management committees that \nhave the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the \nCorporation.\nBank of America  46", "start_char_idx": 3929, "end_char_idx": 6924, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57fdbaf3-4e84-40c2-8739-a38b2ab1766c": {"__data__": {"id_": "57fdbaf3-4e84-40c2-8739-a38b2ab1766c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df755d29-43b5-4ac7-a3da-bb71eb903700", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "cba4c17c4ce91f120ea004506a56a268204202c9829d4286c0417e0cd757603a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6fda6094-2a7c-4118-91c5-ceee54307092", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "50f325509a221a50c18daf6701c2f2cd86b59c9c17a24c1fc14c730ecdfb4286", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0ddae2d3-4963-4fef-ac73-e6cf2e0bf07b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "38b1a84ead989062519469f3c565181d332466470425db17d3ebf7a1cf43f79d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "dfb53c47ac038c12e1bac41c49cc8cc0cb746e993359e3003613f32af56e540b", "text": "Board of Directors and Board Committees\nThe Board is composed of 15 directors, all but one of whom are \nindependent.

The Board committees discussed below have \nthe principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our \nrisk management activities. Through these activities, the Board \nand applicable committees are provided with information on our \nrisk profile and oversee senior management addressing key \nrisks we face. Other Board committees, as described below, \nprovide additional oversight of specific risks. \nEach of the committees shown on the above chart regularly \nreports to the Board on risk-related matters within the \ncommittee\u2019s responsibilities, which is intended to collectively \nprovide the Board with integrated insight about our management \nof enterprise-wide risks.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance \nand independence of the Independent Registered Public \nAccounting Firm, the performance of our corporate audit \nfunction, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, \nour compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and \nmakes inquiries of senior management or the Chief Audit \nExecutive (CAE) to determine whether there are scope or \nresource limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to \nexecute its responsibilities.

GRM, led by the Chief \nRisk Officer (CRO), is responsible for independently assessing \nand overseeing risks within FLUs and other control functions. \nGRM establishes written enterprise policies and procedures \noutlining how aggregate risks are identified, measured, \nmonitored and controlled. \nThe CRO has the stature, authority and independence needed \nto develop and implement a meaningful risk management \nframework and practices to guide the Corporation in managing \nrisk. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports \ndirectly to both the ERC and the CEO.

We \nemploy an effective risk management process, referred to as \nIdentify, Measure, Monitor and Control, as part of our daily \nactivities.\nIdentify  \u2013 To be effectively managed, risks must be proactively \nidentified and well understood. Proper risk identification \nfocuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent \nin our business activities or key risks that may arise from \nexternal factors. Each employee is expected to identify and \nescalate risks promptly. Risk identification is an ongoing \nprocess that incorporates input from FLUs and control \nfunctions. It is designed to be forward-looking and to capture \nrelevant risk factors across all of our lines of business.\nMeasure  \u2013 Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and \naccurately measured through a systematic process including \nqualitative statements and quantitative limits. Risk is \nmeasured at various levels, including, but not limited to, risk \ntype, FLU and legal entity, and also on an aggregate basis. \nThis risk measurement process helps to capture changes in \nour risk profile due to changes in strategic direction, concentrations, portfolio quality and the overall economic \nenvironment. Senior management considers how risk \nexposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios.\nMonitor \u2013 We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to \nrisk appetite, policies and standards. We also regularly \nupdate risk assessments and review risk exposures. Through \nour monitoring, we know our level of risk relative to limits and \ncan take action in a timely manner. We also know when risk \nlimits are breached and have processes to appropriately \nreport and escalate exceptions. This includes timely requests \nfor approval to managers and alerts to executive \nmanagement, management-level committees or the Board \n(directly or through an appropriate committee).\nControl  \u2013 We establish and communicate risk limits and controls \nthrough policies, standards, procedures and processes. The \nlimits and controls can be adjusted by senior management or \nthe Board when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These \nlimits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading volume, \noperational loss) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in \nhigher-risk categories). Our FLUs are held accountable for \nperforming within the established limits. \nThe formal processes used to manage risk represent a part \nof our overall risk management process.

We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit \nadverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a \npotential resolution of Bank of America.\nStrategic Risk Management\nStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the \nmajor risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, \ncompliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results \nfrom incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, \ninappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy \nexecution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in \nthe regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in \nthe geographic locations in which we operate, such as \ncompetitor actions, changing customer preferences, product \nobsolescence and technology developments.\nAn aspect of strategic risk is the risk that the Corporation\u2019s \ncapital levels are not adequate to meet minimum regulatory \nrequirements and support execution of business activities or \nabsorb losses from risks during normal or adverse economic \nand market conditions. As such, capital risk is managed in \nparallel to strategic risk.\nWe manage strategic risk through the Strategic Risk \nEnterprise Policy and integration into the strategic planning \nprocess, among other activities. Our strategic plan is consistent \nwith our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements, \nand specifically addresses strategic risks impacting each \nbusiness.\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the \nstrategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk \nAppetite Statement. With oversight by the Board, senior \nmanagement directs the lines of business to execute our \nstrategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and \nrisk appetite. The executive management team monitors \nbusiness performance throughout the year and provides the \nBoard with regular progress reports on whether strategic \nobjectives and timelines are being met, including reports on \nstrategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be \nconsidered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus \non assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the \ncurrent risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, \nstaffing levels and changes required to support the strategic \nplan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such \nas market growth rates and peer analysis. \nSignificant strategic actions, such as capital actions, \nmaterial acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are \nreviewed and approved by the Board. At the business level, \nprocesses are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications \nof new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services \nand other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and \napproval where required. With oversight by the Board and the \nERC, executive management performs similar analyses \nthroughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial \nforecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed \nappropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk \nappetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted \nfinancial strength. Proprietary models are used to measure the \ncapital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and \nstrategic risks. The allocated capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board, \nexecutive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of \neach business in approving strategic and financial operating \nplans. The businesses use allocated capital to define business \nstrategies, and price products and transactions.\nCapital Management\nThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital \nis more than adequate to support its business activities and \naligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. \nAdditionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all \ntimes, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic \ngrowth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and \ncounterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, \ncontinue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of \nstrength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future \nregulatory capital requirements. Capital management is \nintegrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is \na key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, \nrisk appetite and risk limits.\nWe conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment \nProcess (ICAAP) on a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forward-\nlooking assessment of our projected capital needs and \nresources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk \nforecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market \nconditions.

Basel 3 established minimum capital ratios \nand buffer requirements and outlined two methods of \ncalculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), the Standardized \napproach and the Advanced approaches. The Standardized \napproach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on \nexposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk \nweights based on internal models. \nThe Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also \nsubject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The \nCorporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are \nAdvanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are \nrequired to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA \nunder both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The \nlower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced \napproaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio \nrequirements are used to assess capital adequacy, including \nunder the PCA framework. As of December\u00a0 31, 2022, the \ncommon equity tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 capital and Total capital \nratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios.\nMinimum Capital Requirements\nIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and \ndiscretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-\nbased capital ratio requirements that include a capital \nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced \napproaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach \nonly), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a \nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The \nbuffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 \ncapital. For the period from October 1, 2021 through September \n30, 2022, the Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio \nrequirement was 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and \nAdvanced approaches. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR \nstress test, the Corporation\u2019s SCB increased to 3.4 percent, \nresulting in a minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement of 10.4 \npercent under the Standardized approach for the period from \nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. Our minimum \nCET1 capital ratio requirement under the Advanced approaches remains unchanged at 9.5 percent.\nThe Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge \non an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the \nhigher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent \nwith the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s \nassessment methodology and is calculated using specified \nindicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the \nMethod 1 approach by, among other factors, including a \nmeasure of the Corporation\u2019s reliance on short-term wholesale \nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher \nunder Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent from \n2.5 percent on January 1, 2024, which will increase our \nminimum CET1 capital ratio requirement. At December\u00a0 31, \n2022, the Corporation\u2019s CET1 capital ratio of 11.2 percent \nunder the Standardized approach exceeded its current CET1 \ncapital ratio requirement as well as the minimum requirement \nexpected to be in place as of January 1, 2024 due to an \nanticipated increase in our G-SIB surcharge.\nThe Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum \nsupplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a \nleverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain \nrestrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus \npayments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are \nrequired to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be \nconsidered well capitalized under the PCA framework.  The \nnumerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The \ndenominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily \naverage of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less \npermitted deductions, and applicable temporary exclusions, as \nwell as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet \nexposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter.\nCapital Composition and Ratios\nTable 10 presents Bank of America Corporation\u2019s capital ratios \nand related information in accordance with Basel 3 \nStandardized and Advanced approaches as measured at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.

The \nParent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow \nof dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to \nservice its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as \nit would have had it not entered into these arrangements and \ntransferred any assets. These arrangements support our \npreferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which \nonly the Parent would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy \nCode.\nIn consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings \nissued a subordinated note to the Parent in a principal amount \nequal to the value of the transferred assets. The aggregate \nprincipal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any \nfuture asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the Parent \nwith a committed line of credit that allows the Parent to draw \nfunds necessary to service near-term cash needs. These \narrangements support our preferred single point of entry \nresolution strategy, under which only the Parent would be \nresolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements \ninclude provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the \nsubordinated note and require the Parent to transfer its \nremaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected \nliquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the \nParent becomes imminent. \nGlobal Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the \nParent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-\nquality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, \nreferred  to  as  Global  Liquidity  Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the Parent and selected \nsubsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer \nsubsidiaries, even during  stressed market conditions. Our cash \nis primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a \nlesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the \ncomposition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to \nU.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency \nMBS and other investment-grade securities, and a select group \nof non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these \nsecurities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase \nagreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities \nthat allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global \nbusinesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, \ntax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the \ntransferability of funds among entities.\nTable 15 presents average GLS for the three months ended \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4546, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fec4b1e-50d3-4a5f-ac76-1613e6dc7a16": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fec4b1e-50d3-4a5f-ac76-1613e6dc7a16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa55687e-5442-4b21-b392-4c0bd0f73014", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6e8bb87778f3f1ce76718f43f63a6a4481d048659b789345cf3b3561a4b56699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f68cfa5c-28fb-471a-976f-8822ac3fbc22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "93d3349ff021b8eb6a5cdf8710321f9c8e77c394d68058c861a1a77f87c37f1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "45c067b0-2166-4b99-9890-66a77a342016", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04811959214e57f93732c0e17f320e400a09c792dcc005101120c11590297faa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5c3b42282e3473972325be0364dd920ad87ea5d06912644f8aa67d249bd64c53", "text": "Our cash \nis primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a \nlesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the \ncomposition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to \nU.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency \nMBS and other investment-grade securities, and a select group \nof non-U.S. government securities.

However, HQLA for \npurposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but \nat a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the \nexclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The \nLCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution\u2019s \nunencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows \nthe institution could encounter over a 30-day period of \nsignificant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our \naverage consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $605 billion \nand $617 billion for the three months ended December 31, \n2022 and 2021. For the same periods, the average \nconsolidated LCR was 120 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR \nfluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.\nLiquidity Stress Analysis \nWe utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining \nthe appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent \nand our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash \noutflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider \nand utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific \nevents, including potential credit rating downgrades for the \nParent and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including \npotential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our \nhistorical experience, experience of distressed and failed \nfinancial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected \nand unexpected future events.\nThe types of potential contractual and contingent cash \noutflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not \nlimited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt \nand reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to \nsecured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; \nincreased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and \nletters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could \ncall if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin \nrequirements arising from market value changes; and potential \nliquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer \nactivities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not \nlimited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact \npotential contractual and contingent outflows and the related \nfinancial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could \nbe material to our financial results.\nWe consider all sources of funds that we could access \nduring each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching \navailable sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by \nlegal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage \nour asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines \non certain funding sources and businesses.\nNet Stable Funding Ratio\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement \nfor large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding \nover a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in \nboth normal and adverse economic conditions and is \ncomplementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity \nrisks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a \nconsolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At \nDecember\u00a031, 2022, the Corporation and its insured depository \ninstitutions were in compliance with this requirement.\nDiversified Funding Sources\nWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and \nsecured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally \ncoordinated funding approach diversified across products, \nprograms, markets, currencies and investor groups. \nThe primary benefits of our centralized funding approach \ninclude greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name \nrecognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the \nvariable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where \nregulations, time zone differences or other business \nconsiderations make Parent funding impractical, certain other \nsubsidiaries may issue their own debt.\nWe fund a substantial portion of our lending activities \nthrough our deposits, which were $1.93 trillion and $2.1 trillion \nat December\u00a0 31, 2022 and 2021.

Of these senior \nnotes, $16.6 billion will be callable and become TLAC ineligible \nduring 2023, and $21.4 billion, $21.3 billion, $16.0 billion and \n$24.4 billion will do so during each of 2024 through 2027, \nrespectively, and $79.4 billion thereafter.\nWe issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities \nand currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain \nan appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of \nunsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general \nmarket conditions or by matters specific to the financial \nservices industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate \nrefinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our \nborrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or \nquarter. We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured \nnotes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-\neligible debt. During 2022, we issued $12.5 billion of structured \nnotes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns \nlinked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or \ncommodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to \npay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in \nthe underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, \nthe cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We \ncould be required to settle certain structured note obligations \nfor cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain \ncircumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning \npurposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such \nborrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or \nredemption date.\nSubstantially all of our senior and subordinated debt \nobligations contain no provisions that could trigger a \nrequirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral \nsupport, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or \ncreate additional financial obligations upon an adverse change \nin our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or \nstock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, \nincluding issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note \n11 \u2013 Long-term Debt  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe use derivative transactions to manage the duration, \ninterest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering \nthe characteristics of the assets they are funding.

Credit risk \ncan also arise from operational failures that result in an \nerroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We \ndefine the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the \nloss potential arising from all product classifications including \nloans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-\nfor-sale and unfunded lending commitments, which include loan \ncommitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. \nDerivative positions are recorded at fair value, and assets held-\nfor-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are \naccounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for \ncategories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as \npart of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair \nvalue adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, \nour credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the \ncounterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position \nfail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the \ncurrent fair value to represent credit exposure without giving \nconsideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk \namounts take into consideration the effects of legally \nenforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our \nconsumer and commercial credit extension and review \nprocedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. \nFor more information on derivatives and credit extension \ncommitments, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives  and Note 12 \u2013 \nCommitments and Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial \nStatements.\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the \nborrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of \nunderlying collateral and other support given current events, \nconditions and expectations.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4962, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31724618-7321-434b-8d19-6bdb18f42f1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "31724618-7321-434b-8d19-6bdb18f42f1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "424eac26-e795-414f-ac96-d47b044fb351", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c65bd9ca1486ac42b59d8ca221d7700625b6f733b362566957e4787e1bbd5579", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad096d43-fa5d-4b45-9b9c-b71216188fc1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3219ea1b9984b64cc12623ddc7221c19120d6e15632075b678e56ed70c490f8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "81479dae-f77f-44a8-ab2d-fbe51e89f6d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b776132ecd0d70873ae3b4aed92cd8613d68b4e8eb93f1d53e629e1c1669d469", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2d6aa7bb843aefaa9d055c3543d4302dae4ba96c7f867b6c845e018d4e8e8639", "text": "For derivative positions, \nour credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the \ncounterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position \nfail to perform under the terms of those contracts.

Our 2022 net charge-off ratio remained near historic \nlows, and nonperforming loans and commercial reservable \ncriticized utilized exposure decreased compared to 2021, which \nwas partially offset by an increase in reservable criticized \nexposure associated with our direct exposure to Russia as a \nresult of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. While uncertainty around \nthe pandemic has diminished, uncertainty remains regarding \nbroader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, \nrising rates and the current geopolitical situation and could lead \nto adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods.\nFor information on our credit risk management activities, see \nConsumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial \nPortfolio Credit Risk Management on page 64, Non-U.S. \nPortfolio on page 70, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 73, \nand Note 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for \nCredit Losses  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As \npart of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit \nexposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval \nbased on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan \norigination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and \nif necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial \ncondition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or \ncounterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, \ncollateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits \nwhile also balancing these considerations with the total \nborrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools \nto continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty \nto perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In \naddition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of \nallocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt \nto work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify \ntheir loans to terms that better align with their current ability to \npay. In situations where an economic concession has been \ngranted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify \nthese loans as TDRs.

We review, measure and manage \nconcentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, \ngeography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, \nmeasure and manage commercial real estate loans by \ngeographic location and property type. In addition, within our \nnon-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by \ncountry. Tables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations. \nWe also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan \nsales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage \nthe size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio.

Due to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine \nconflict, all direct exposure to Russian counterparties was \ndowngraded and reported as reservable criticized exposure, and \nexpected credit losses (ECL) have been incorporated into our \nestimate of the allowance for credit losses. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $45.9 billion during \n2022 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in \nGlobal Banking . This increase was partially offset by lower U.S. \nsmall business commercial loans due to repayments of PPP \nloans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the \nterms of the program.\nCredit quality of commercial real estate borrowers generally \nimproved from 2021 as pandemic-impacted sectors are \nrecovering. However, many commercial real estate markets, \nwhile improving, are still experiencing disruptions in demand, \nsupply chain challenges, tenant difficulties and challenging \ncapital markets. Demand for office space continues to be \nuncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment \nmodels that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use.\nThe commercial allowance for loan and lease losses \nremained relatively unchanged at $5.4 billion at December\u00a031, \n2022, as loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook \nwere offset by asset quality improvement and a reserve release \nfor reduced pandemic uncertainties.

We execute the \nmajority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with \nlarge, multinational financial institutions, including broker-\ndealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other \ninvestors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC \nmarket, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject \nto credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to \nperform under the terms of these contracts. In order to properly \nreflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk \nvaluation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our \npurchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit \nderivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. \nTherefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the \nultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would \ntypically require an increase in the amount of collateral required \nby the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take \nadditional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. For more information on credit derivatives and \ncounterparty credit risk valuation adjustments, see Note 3 \u2013 \nDerivatives  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-U.S. Portfolio\nOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country \nrisk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable \neconomic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social \ninstability and changes in government policies. A risk \nmanagement framework is in place to measure, monitor and \nmanage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct \nrisk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to \nindirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on \nsecured financing transactions or related to client clearing \nactivities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal \ncourse of business through credit, market and operational risk \ngovernance rather than through country risk governance. \nTable 39 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures \nat December\u00a0 31, 2022. These exposures accounted for 89 \npercent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both December\u00a0 31, \n2022 and 2021.

Management\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may \nadversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise \nnegatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial \ninstruments associated  with our operations, primarily within our \nGlobal Markets  segment. We are also exposed to these risks in \nother areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the \nevent of market stress, these risks could have a material \nimpact on our results. For more information, see Interest Rate \nRisk Management for the Banking Book on page 79. \nOur traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-\ntrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost \nfor assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). \nHowever, these positions are still subject to changes in \neconomic value based on varying market conditions, with one of \nthe primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. \nThe risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-\ntrading positions arising from changes in interest rates is \nmanaged through our ALM activities. We have elected to \naccount for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value \noption.\nOur trading positions are reported at fair value with changes \nreflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various \nchanges in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is \ngenerated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, \ncredit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values \nof assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, \ncorrelations across markets and expectations of market \nvolatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a \nvariety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial \ninstruments. The key risk management techniques are \ndiscussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management \nsection.\nGRM is responsible for providing senior management with a \nclear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to \nwhich we are exposed. These responsibilities include ownership \nof market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative \nrisk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing \nand monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, \nconducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, \napproving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory \nrequirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of \nGlobal Markets  are monitored and governed by their respective \ngovernance functions.\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from \ndecisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and \nreports. Given that models are used across the Corporation, \nmodel risk impacts all risk types including credit, market and \noperational risks. The Enterprise Model Risk Policy defines \nmodel risk standards, consistent with our Risk Framework and \nrisk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best \npractice. All models, including risk management, valuation and \nregulatory capital models, must meet certain validation criteria, \nincluding effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the \nmodel, independent model testing and ongoing monitoring \nthrough outcomes analysis and benchmarking. The Enterprise \nModel Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the MRC, oversees \nthat model standards are consistent with model risk \nrequirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model \nvalidation process across the Corporation. \nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose \nvalues vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These \ninstruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, \ndeposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used \nto mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, \nfutures, forwards and swaps.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the \nvalues of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in \ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments \nexposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. \nsubsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, \nfuture cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign \nexchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and \nvarious foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with \nchanges in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or \nnon-U.S.\u00a0 interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate \nthis risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, \nfutures, forwards, and foreign currency-denominated debt and \ndeposits.\nMortgage Risk\nMortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of \nmortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments \nare sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt \nratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and \ninterest rate volatility.

Our \nportfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an \nasset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of \ncredit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging \ninstruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and \nother credit fixed-income instruments.\nMarket Liquidity Risk\nMarket liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of \nexpected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain \ncases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will \nnot be able to transact business and execute trades in an \norderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could \nbe further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing \ncorrelations are compromised by disproportionate demand or \nlack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk \nmitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading \nRisk Management.\nTrading Risk Management\nTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual \nand potential volatility of revenues generated by individual \npositions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques \nand procedures are utilized to enable the most complete \nunderstanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market \nrisk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the \nportfolio of the Corporation. These measures include \nsensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as \nthe potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change \nin interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual \nand hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress \ntesting. Periods of extreme market stress influence the \nreliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative \nevaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk \nmeasures while understanding each of their respective \nlimitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate \nthe risk of the portfolios under the current market environment \nand potential future environments.\nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it \nallows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the \neffects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the \nvalue of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to \ngenerate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR \nrepresents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more \nthan a certain number of times per period, based on a specified \nholding period, confidence level and window of historical data. \nWe use one VaR model consistently across the trading \nportfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on \na three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic \nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means \nthat for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be \nlosses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading \ndays.\nWithin any VaR model, there are significant and numerous \nassumptions that will differ from company to company. The \naccuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality \nof historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A \nVaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for \nnew products that do not have the necessary historical market \ndata or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices \nare not consistently available. For positions with insufficient \nhistorical data for the VaR calculation, the process for \nestablishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. \nThis analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate \nboth the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk \nfactors that the missing data would be expected to experience.\nVaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as \nchanges in market conditions or in the composition of the \nportfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, \nthe historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate \nhigher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be \nexperienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market \nconditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR \nmodel on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of \nmarket stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying \nthe model.

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss \nexceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are \nevaluated to understand the positions and market moves that \nproduced the trading loss with a goal to help confirm that the \nVaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We \nexpect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in \nline with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. \nFor example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one \ntrading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to \nthree trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. \nThe number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from \nthe statistically expected number of excesses if the current level \nof market volatility is materially different than the level of market \nvolatility that existed during the three years of historical data \nused in the VaR calculation.\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by \nregulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR \ncomponent of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue \ndiffers from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes \nrevenue from trading activities that either do not generate \nmarket risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some \nexamples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are \nfees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day \ntrading revenues. \nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for \nregulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key \nlegal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are \nreported to senior market risk management. Senior \nmanagement regularly reviews and evaluates the results of \nthese tests. \nDuring 2022, there was one day where this subset of trading \nrevenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio \nVaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. \nTotal Trading-related Revenue\nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and \nCVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), \nrepresents the total amount earned from trading positions, \nincluding market-based net interest income, which are taken in \na diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more \ninformation on fair value, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value \nMeasurements  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by \ngeneral market conditions and customer demand.

Interest rate risk \nis measured as the potential change in net interest income \ncaused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing \nactivities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest \nrate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. \nThe baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future \nbusiness growth, ALM positioning and the future direction of \ninterest rate movements as implied by market-based forward \ncurves. \nWe then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative \ninterest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to \nassess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net \ninterest income forecast is frequently updated for changing \nassumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, \nmarket conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually \nmonitor our banking book balance sheet position in order to \nmaintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate \nchanges.\nThe interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate \nbalance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth \nand pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity \ncharacteristics and investment securities premium amortization. \nOur overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that \nmovements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect \nearnings and capital.\nTable 45 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates \nused in developing the forward curve used in our baseline \nforecasts at December\u00a031, 2022 and 2021.Table 45 Forward Rates\nDecember 31, 2022\n Federal\nFundsThree-month\nLIBOR10-Year\nSwap\nSpot rates  4.50 %  4.77 %  3.84 %\n12-month forward rates  4.75  4.78  3.62 \nDecember 31, 2021\nSpot rates  0.25 %  0.21 %  1.58 %\n12-month forward rates  1.00  1.07  1.84 \nTable 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest \nincome over the next 12 months from December\u00a031, 2022 and \n2021 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel \nshocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we \nevaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in \nthe context of the current rate environment. The interest rate \nscenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at \nzero. Depending on the level of interest rates, Down-rate \nscenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock, \nparticularly in low rate environments.\nThe overall decrease in asset sensitivity, as shown in the \nfollowing table, to Up-rate scenarios was primarily due to an \nincrease in long-end and short-end rates. We continue to be \nasset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with \nthe majority of that impact coming from the short end of the \nyield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact \nthe fair value of our debt securities classified as available for \nsale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital \nlevels under the Basel 3 capital rules.

As part of our ALM \nactivities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and \ninterest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing \ninterest rate sensitivity.\nThe behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast \nand in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in \nour projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity \nanalysis in Table 46 assumes no change in deposit portfolio \nsize or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate \nenvironments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity \nresulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing \ndeposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding \nwould reduce our benefit in those scenarios.\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative \nContracts\nWe use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts \nin our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign \nexchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to \nmanage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair \nvalue of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. \nOur interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged \nswaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign \nexchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our \nforeign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate \nswaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency \nforward contracts and options.\nThe derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into \ntwo broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other \nrisk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges \nare primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as \ndescribed in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking \nBook  section  and  are included in the sensitivities presented in \nTable 46. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives \nin  accounting  hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign \nexchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign \nexchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's \nmarket risk exposure in this area is not significant.\nRisk management derivatives are predominantly used to \nhedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-\ndenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially \nall foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the \nCorporation\u2019s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial \ninstruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to \nother market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis \nspreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are \nnot a significant component of these foreign exchange \nderivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not \nsignificant. For more information on the accounting for \nderivatives, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives  to the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements.\nMortgage Banking Risk Management\nWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us \nto credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We \ndetermine whether loans will be held for investment or held for \nsale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity \nrisks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we \noriginate.\nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the \nmortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market \nfactors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock \ncommitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage \nLHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are \nsold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest \nrates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these \ninstruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest \nrates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower \nprepayment expectations. Because the interest rate risks of \nthese hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall \nhedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio \nconsisting of derivative contracts and securities.\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $78 \nmillion, $39 million and $321 million. For more information on \nMSRs, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements  to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nCompliance and Operational Risk Management\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, \nmaterial financial loss or damage to the reputation of the \nCorporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply \nwith the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and \nour internal policies and procedures (collectively, applicable \nlaws, rules and regulations).

Corporate Audit \nprovides an independent assessment and validation through \ntesting of key compliance and operational risk processes and \ncontrols across the Corporation. \nThe Corporation's Global Compliance \u2013 Enterprise Policy and \nOperational Risk Management \u2013 Enterprise Policy set the \nrequirements for reporting compliance and operational risk \ninformation to executive management as well as the Board or \nappropriate Board-level committees and reflect Global \nCompliance and Operational Risk\u2019s responsibilities for \nconducting independent oversight of the Corporation\u2019s \ncompliance and operational risk management activities. The \nBoard provides oversight of compliance risk through its Audit \nCommittee and the ERC, and operational risk through its ERC. \nA key operational risk facing the Corporation is information \nsecurity, which includes cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk \nincludes exposure to failures or interruptions of service or \nsecurity breaches resulting from malicious technological attacks \nthat impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our or \nthird parties' operations, systems or data. The Corporation \nseeks to mitigate information security risk and associated \nreputational and compliance risk by employing a multi-layered \nand intelligence-led Global Information Security Program focused \non preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to \nand recovering from cyber threats and incidents and effectively \noperating the Corporation\u2019s processes. Additionally, our \nbusiness continuity policy, standards and procedures are \ndesigned to maintain the availability of business functions and \nenable impacted units within the Corporation and third parties \nto achieve strategic objectives in the event of a cybersecurity \nincident.\nThe Global Information Security Program is supported by \nthree lines of defense. The Global Information Security Team \nwithin the first line of defense is responsible for the day-to-day \nmanagement of the Global Information Security Program, which \nincludes defining policies and procedures to safeguard the \nCorporation\u2019s information systems and data, conducting \nvulnerability and third-party information security assessments, \ninformation security event management (e.g., responding to \nransomware and distributed denial of service attacks), \nevaluation of external cyber intelligence, supporting industry \ncybersecurity efforts and working with governmental agencies, \nand developing employee training to support adherence to the \nCorporation\u2019s policies and procedures. As the second line of \ndefense, Global Compliance and Operational Risk independently \nassesses, monitors and tests information security risk across \nthe Corporation, as well as the effectiveness of the Global \nInformation Security Program. Corporate Audit serves as the \nthird line of defense, conducting additional independent review \nand validation of the first-line processes and functions.  As part \nof our Global Information Security Program, we leverage both \ninternal and external assessments and partnerships with \nindustry leaders to help approach information security \nholistically. Additionally the Corporation maintains a \ncomprehensive enterprise-wide program that defines standards \nfor the planning, sourcing, management, and oversight of third-\nparty relationships and third-party access to its system, \nfacilities, and/or confidential or proprietary data for a business \npurpose or supervisory function. \nThrough established governance structures, we have \nprocesses to help facilitate appropriate and effective oversight \nof information security risk. These routines enable our three \nlines of defense and management to debate information \nsecurity risks and monitor control performance to allow for \nfurther escalation to executive management, management and Board-level committees or to the Board, as appropriate. The \nBoard is actively engaged in the oversight of Bank of America\u2019s \nGlobal Information Security Program and devotes significant \ntime and attention to the oversight of cybersecurity and \ninformation security risk. The Board regularly discusses \ncybersecurity and information security risks with the Chief \nTechnology and Information Officer and the Chief Information \nSecurity Officer. Additionally, the ERC receives regular reporting, \nand reviews and approves the Information Security Program and \nPolicy on an annual basis.\nReputational Risk Management\nReputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the \nCorporation may adversely impact profitability or operations. \nReputational risk may result from many of the Corporation\u2019s \nactivities, including those related to the management of our \nstrategic, operational, compliance and credit risks. \nThe Corporation manages reputational risk through \nestablished policies and controls embedded throughout its \nbusiness and risk management processes.

These changes \nand events may have broad impacts on operations, supply \nchains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are \notherwise referred to, respectively, as physical risk and \ntransition risk. These risks may impact both financial and \nnonfinancial risk types. Physical risk may lead to increased \ncredit risk by diminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment capacity or \nimpacting the value of collateral. Physical risk may also increase \noperational risk by impacting the Corporation\u2019s facilities, \nemployees, customers or vendors. Transition risks may amplify \ncredit risk through the financial impacts of changes in policy, \ntechnology or the market on the Corporation or its \ncounterparties. Unanticipated market changes can lead to \nsudden price adjustments and give rise to heightened market \nrisk.

We \nhave procedures and processes in place to facilitate making \nthese judgments. \nThe more judgmental estimates are summarized in the \nfollowing discussion. We have identified and described the \ndevelopment of the variables most important in the estimation \nprocesses that involve mathematical models to derive the \nestimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative \njudgments that could be used in the process of determining the \ninputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used \nthe factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value \nin developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from \nour estimates of the key variables could materially impact our \nresults of operations. Separate from the possible future impact \nto our results of operations from input and model variables, the \nvalue of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and \nliabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, \noften significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future \ncredit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions \nmay change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting \nvolatility could have a significant, negative effect on future \noperating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of \ndeficiencies in our models or inputs.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan \nand lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending \ncommitments.

A critical \njudgment in the process is the weighting of our forward-looking \nmacroeconomic scenarios that are incorporated into our \nquantitative models. As any one economic outlook is inherently \nuncertain, the Corporation uses multiple macroeconomic \nscenarios in its ECL calculation, which have included a baseline \nscenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse \nscenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a \ndownside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest \nrates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to \nthe severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an \nupside scenario that considers the potential for improvement \nabove the baseline scenario. The overall economic outlook is \nweighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in \n2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower \ngross domestic product (GDP) and higher unemployment rate \nexpectations as compared to the prior year. Generally, as the \nconsensus estimates improve or deteriorate, the allowance for \ncredit losses will change in a similar direction. There are \nmultiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with \nthe key variables including, but not limited to, U.S. GDP and \nunemployment rates. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted \nmacroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate \nwas forecasted at 5.2 percent, 4.7 percent and 4.3 percent in \nthe fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and \nthe weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was \nforecasted to grow at 2.1 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.9 percent \nyear-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, \nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022, the latest consensus \nestimates for the U.S. average unemployment rate for the fourth \nquarter of 2022 was 3.7 percent and U.S. GDP was forecasted \nto grow 0.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022, \nreflecting a tighter labor market and depressed growth \nexpectations compared to our macroeconomic outlook as of \nDecember 31, 2021, and were factored into our  allowance for \ncredit losses estimate as of December 31, 2022. In addition, \nas of December 31, 2022, the weighted macroeconomic \noutlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted \nat 5.6 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters of 2023 \nand 2024, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. \nGDP was forecasted to contract 0.4 percent and grow 1.2 \npercent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of  2023 and 2024.\nIn addition to the above judgments and estimates, the \nallowance for credit losses can also be impacted by \nunanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as \nincreases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in \nour commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in \nborrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card \nportfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a \nprimary driver of  LTVs, in  our consumer real estate portfolio, all \nof which have some degree of uncertainty. The allowance for \ncredit losses increased to $14.2 billion from $13.8 billion at \nDecember 31, 2021, primarily due to loan growth and a \ndampened macroeconomic outlook in 2022.\nTo provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the \nmacroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the \nestimate of our allowance for credit losses, the Corporation \ncompared the December 31, 2022 modeled ECL from the \nbaseline scenario and our adverse scenario. Relative to the \nbaseline scenario, the adverse scenario assumed a peak U.S. \nunemployment rate of nearly three percentage points higher \nthan the baseline scenario, a decline in U.S. GDP followed by a \nprolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a \ndifference  of  approximately  eight  percent  at  the  trough. This sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the \nallowance for credit losses of approximately $4 billion.\nWhile the sensitivity analysis may be useful to understand \nhow changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our \nmodeled ECLs, it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for \ncredit losses is expected to change in a different \nmacroeconomic outlook.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4264, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4633071-a1e6-4e6f-9ef1-a0ba2d178104": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4633071-a1e6-4e6f-9ef1-a0ba2d178104", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83e6c6cc-2dca-4727-adea-8a24a857d00b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ad927720ebc16c188b2644d261e98d5184481f50f7615eb429f814a01287e0b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ee342ef-4e4b-4ddf-b449-aab0ce6b5e26", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e45db8c84900496fb3d5d50c1c6ba201340fa3283e61e2366c2992e460fc391d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0bb159e7-4ada-4a2e-9d8b-d4fc2f4650e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "71e6f1e4e5ecd4528e4dc273d7bce90eb4e67881238dadc66f7b654b8f128a9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "058f8fbefc18eeb1b58fe9fa9e5ef3f5bfb756885cc2e59dcaa640a0024850c9", "text": "Relative to the \nbaseline scenario, the adverse scenario assumed a peak U.S. \nunemployment rate of nearly three percentage points higher \nthan the baseline scenario, a decline in U.S. GDP followed by a \nprolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a \ndifference  of  approximately  eight  percent  at  the  trough.

Importantly, the analysis does not \nincorporate a variety of factors, including qualitative reserves \nand the weighting of alternate scenarios, which could have \noffsetting effects on the estimate. Considering the variety of \nfactors contemplated when developing and weighting \nmacroeconomic outlooks such as recent economic events, \nleading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party \neconomists and industry trends, in addition to other qualitative \nfactors, the Corporation believes the allowance for credit losses \nat December 31, 2022 is appropriate. \nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are required to \nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of \nunobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair \nvalue measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based \non the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting \nstandards. \nThe fair values of assets and liabilities may include \nadjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where \nappropriate. Valuations of products using models or other \ntechniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant \ninputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for \nvaluation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs \nto valuation models are considered unobservable if they are \nsupported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme \nvolatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be \nmore variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use \nin the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application \nof estimates and management judgment in determining the fair \nvalue of assets and liabilities, we have in place various \nprocesses and controls that include: a model validation policy \nthat requires review and approval of quantitative models used \nfor deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and \nrisk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that \nrequires verification of all traded product valuations; and a \nperiodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss \nreporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation \ncontrols, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which \ncan and do include both market-observable and internally-\nmodeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this \ninformation is affected by our understanding of how the broker \nand/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of \nreliance applied to those that are more directly observable and \nlesser reliance applied to those developed through their own \ninternal modeling. For example, broker quotes in less active \nmarkets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable. \nThese processes and controls are performed independently of \nthe business. For more information, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value \nMeasurements  and Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value Option to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements. \nLevel 3 Assets and Liabilities\nFinancial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, where values are \nbased on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both \nunobservable and are significant to the overall fair value \nmeasurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value \nhierarchy established in applicable accounting standards.

A company\u2019s internal \ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and \nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in \nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions \nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide \nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as \nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and \nthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made \nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and \ndirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance \nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized \nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that \ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over \nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future \nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the \ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters \narising from the current period audit of the consolidated \nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be \ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to \naccounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated \nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, \nsubjective, or complex judgments.

As of December\u00a031, 2022, the allowance for loan \nand lease losses was $12.7 billion on total loans and leases of \n$1,040.0 billion, which excludes loans accounted for under the \nfair value option. For commercial and consumer card loans, the \nexpected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative \nmethods that consider a variety of factors such as historical \nloss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well \nas an economic outlook over the life of the loan. In its loss \nforecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward \nlooking information through the use of macroeconomic \nscenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These \nmacroeconomic scenarios include variables that have \nhistorically been key drivers of increases and decreases in \ncredit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, \nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product \nlevels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are \nchosen and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a \nvariety of factors including recent economic events, leading \neconomic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party \neconomists and industry trends. Also included in the allowance \nfor loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover \nlosses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, \nmay not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or \nthe economic assumptions. Factors that the Corporation \nconsiders include changes in lending policies and procedures, \nbusiness conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, \nportfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due \nloans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such \nas competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among \nothers. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent \nuncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical \ndata.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that \nperforming procedures relating to the allowance for loan and \nlease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is \na critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and \nestimation by management in developing lifetime economic \nforecast scenarios, related weightings to each scenario and \ncertain qualitative reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of \nauditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing \nprocedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, and (ii) \nthe audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and \nknowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and \nevaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall \nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These \nprocedures included testing the effectiveness of controls \nrelating to the allowance for loan and lease losses, including \ncontrols over the evaluation and approval of models, forecast \nscenarios and related weightings, and qualitative reserves. \nThese procedures also included, among others, testing \nmanagement\u2019s process for estimating the allowance for loan \nand lease losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of \nthe loss forecast models and methodology, (ii) evaluating the \nreasonableness of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii) \nevaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s development, \nselection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios \nused in the loss forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness \nand accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (v) evaluating \nthe reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the \nmodel output results to determine the overall allowance for loan and lease losses. The procedures also included the involvement \nof professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist \nin evaluating the appropriateness of certain loss forecast \nmodels, the reasonableness of economic forecast scenarios \nand related weightings and the reasonableness of certain \nqualitative reserves. \nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial \nstatements, the Corporation carries certain financial \ninstruments at fair value, which includes $10.7 billion of assets \nand $7.1 billion of liabilities classified as Level 3 fair value \nmeasurements that are valued on a recurring basis and $3.4 \nbillion of assets classified as Level 3 fair value measurements \nthat are valued on a nonrecurring basis, for which the \ndetermination of fair value requires significant management \njudgment or estimation. The Corporation determines the fair \nvalue of Level 3 financial instruments using pricing models, \ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that \nrequire inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to \nthe overall fair value measurement.

Significant Accounting \nPrinciples\nBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a \nfinancial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial \nservices and products throughout the U.S. and in certain \ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe Corporation\u201d as used \nherein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, \nBank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of \nBank of America Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries or affiliates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of \nthe Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those \nvariable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the \nprimary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions \nhave been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired \ncompanies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for \nVIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary \nbeneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are \nnot included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The \nCorporation accounts for investments in companies for which it \nowns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise \nsignificant influence over operating and financing decisions \nusing the equity method of accounting. These investments, \nwhich include the Corporation\u2019s interests in affordable housing \nand renewable energy partnerships, are recorded in other \nassets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment \ntesting, and the Corporation\u2019s proportionate share of income or \nloss is included in other income.\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in \nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the \nUnited States of America requires management to make \nestimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and \ndisclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those \nestimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have \nbeen reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nNew Accounting Standards\nHedge Accounting \nThe FASB issued a new accounting standard that makes \ntargeted improvements to the application of the fair value hedge \naccounting guidance for closed portfolios of financial assets. \nThe targeted improvements were effective January 1, 2023 on a \nprospective basis.\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses\nThe FASB amended the accounting and disclosure requirements \nfor expected credit losses (ECL) by removing the recognition and \nmeasurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) \nand adding disclosures on the financial effect and subsequent \nperformance of certain types of modifications made to \nborrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The effects of these \nchanges on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial position, \nresults of operations or disclosures in the Notes to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements are not significant. The \namendments were effective on January 1, 2023, which the \nCorporation adopted using a modified retrospective approach.Significant Accounting Principles\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in \nthe process of collection, cash segregated under federal and \nother brokerage regulations, and amounts due from \ncorrespondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain \nnon-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as \nto withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements \nor regulatory requirements.\nSecurities Financing Agreements\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell \nand securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase \n(securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized \nfinancing transactions except in instances where the transaction \nis required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase \ntransactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at \nacquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. In instances \nwhere the interest is negative, the Corporation\u2019s policy is to \npresent negative interest on financial assets as interest income \nand negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense. \nFor securities financing agreements that are accounted for \nunder the fair value option, the changes in the fair value of \nthese  securities  financing  agreements are recorded  in market \nmaking and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of \nIncome. \nThe Corporation\u2019s policy is to monitor the market value of \nthe principal amount loaned under resale agreements and \nobtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to \ncounterparties when appropriate. Securities financing \nagreements do not create material credit risk due to these \ncollateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is \nnot necessary.\nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a \nsecurities lending agreement and receives securities that can \nbe pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the \nsecurities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to \nreturn those securities.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5270, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "517585f0-664f-4e73-a467-9469add846e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "517585f0-664f-4e73-a467-9469add846e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1a7c8311-9b64-4cc8-8e7e-cb8956d83b3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "680c183986af42f761eb8a2001c63346c0e0877cbfe0480d8694b5e566d684dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "80c29c39-1744-4223-81eb-41db30d96cd1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "41d15c476bf42096df06b4a38d7002991a4ccf78afb3dfc0225c7014f02edbe9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc2079df-5984-49a3-b4a8-7f58534483f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f47396334d23c7e1900a0c48a175e49d4b6537ec3dd914a30231d332b42802b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1bbdbde7ca9a52df0dd67465ced549bba65800eb45059426bcfcdee165856c22", "text": "For securities financing agreements that are accounted for \nunder the fair value option, the changes in the fair value of \nthese  securities  financing  agreements are recorded  in market \nmaking and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of \nIncome. \nThe Corporation\u2019s policy is to monitor the market value of \nthe principal amount loaned under resale agreements and \nobtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to \ncounterparties when appropriate.

For non-exchange \ntraded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing \nmodels, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar \ntechniques for which the determination of fair value may require \nsignificant management judgment or estimation.\nValuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the \nvalue of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These \nvalues also take into account the Corporation\u2019s own credit \nstanding.\nTrading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative \nassets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance \nSheet with changes in fair value included in market making and \nsimilar activities.\nDerivatives used for other risk management activities are \nincluded in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives \nused in other risk management activities have not been \ndesignated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because \nthey did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to \nan item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that \nthe effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset \nor liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the \nConsolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The \nchanges in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate \ncertain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), \ninterest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage \nloans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation \nare recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of \nderivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign \ncurrency risk are included in market making and similar \nactivities. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to \nmitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. The \nchanges in the fair value of these derivatives are included in \nmarket making and similar activities and other income.\nDerivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes \n(Accounting Hedges)\nFor accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at \ninception all relationships between hedging instruments and \nhedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and \nstrategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. \nAdditionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis \nat the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period \nthereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an \naccounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been \nhighly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash \nflows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The \nCorporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is \ndetermined that a derivative is not expected to be or has \nceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects \nchanges in fair value of the derivative in earnings after \ntermination of the hedge relationship.\nFair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the \nfair value of the Corporation\u2019s assets and liabilities that are \nattributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. \nChanges in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same \nincome statement line item with changes in the fair value of the \nrelated hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value \nhedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the \nprevious adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset \nor liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner \nas other components of the carrying value of that asset or \nliability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing \nliabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the \nremaining life of the respective asset or liability.\nCash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the \nvariability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted \ntransactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate \nfluctuations. The Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to \nhedge the price risk associated with deferred compensation. \nChanges in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow \nhedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive \nincome (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the \nincome statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the \nsame period the hedged item affects earnings.

Operating lease income is \nrecognized on a straight-line basis. The Corporation's lease \narrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new \naccounting standard that requires the measurement of the \nallowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance \nfor loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending \ncommitments, to be based on management\u2019s best estimate of \nthe ECL in the Corporation\u2019s loan and lease portfolio, excluding \nloans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under \nthe fair value option. Upon adoption, a $3.3\u00a0 billion, or 32 \npercent, increase in the allowance for credit losses was \nrecorded on January 1, 2020, which was comprised of a net \nincrease of $2.9\u00a0 billion in the allowance for loan and lease \nlosses and a $310\u00a0million increase in the reserve for unfunded \nlending commitments. The ECL on funded consumer and \ncommercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for \nloan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contra-\nasset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \nThe ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home \nequity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) \nand binding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other \nliabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and \nlease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported \nin the Consolidated Statement of Income at the amount \nnecessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the \ncurrent estimate of ECL.\nFor loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated using \nquantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as \nhistorical loss experience, the current credit quality of the \nportfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the \nloan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on \nthe contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected \nprepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension \noptions that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open-\nended products (e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined \nbased on the maximum repayment term associated with future \ndraws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are \nunconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the \nCorporation does not record any allowance.\nIn its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation \nincorporates forward-looking information through the use of \nmacroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the \nassets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that \nhave historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in \ncredit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, \nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product \nlevels and corporate bond spreads. As any one economic \noutlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages \nmultiple scenarios.

If a \nloan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan \nare not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, \nexpected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal \nbalance immediately prior to the charge-off.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses for TDRs is \nmeasured based on the present value of projected future \nlifetime principal and interest cash flows discounted at the \nloan\u2019s original effective interest rate, or in cases where \nforeclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at \nthe loan\u2019s collateral value or its observable market price, if \navailable. The measurement of ECL for the renegotiated \nconsumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the present \nvalue of projected cash flows discounted using the average TDR \nportfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced \nloans, in effect prior to restructuring. Projected cash flows for \nTDRs use the same economic outlook as discussed above. For \npurposes of computing this specific loss component of the \nallowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and \nsmaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool.\nAlso included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are \nqualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the \nCorporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in \nthe quantitative methods or the economic assumptions \ndescribed above. For example, factors that the Corporation \nconsiders include changes in lending policies and procedures, \nbusiness conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, \nportfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due \nloans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such \nas competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among \nothers. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent \nuncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical \ndata. \nWith the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio, \nthe Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable \nin the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the \nCorporation generally classifies consumer loans as \nnonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest \nincome for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the \nCorporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the \nallowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit \ncard loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income \nagainst the income statement line item where it was originally \nrecorded.\nThe Corporation has identified the following three portfolio \nsegments and measures the allowance for credit losses using \nthe following methods.\nConsumer Real Estate\nTo estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real \nestate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will \ndefault over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in \nestimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling \nmethodologies. The attributes that are most significant in \nestimating the Corporation\u2019s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value \n(LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined \nLTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and \ngeography, all of which are further broken down by present \ncollection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in \ndefault, or in bankruptcy).

The fair value of the collateral \nsecuring these loans is generally determined using an \nautomated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a \nproperty by reference to market data including sales of \ncomparable properties and price trends specific to the \nMetropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued \nis located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the \nCorporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods \nprovide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals \nor broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the \ncollateral.

The estimated life of a credit card receivable is \ndetermined by estimating the amount and timing of expected \nfuture payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments, \nminimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take \nfor a receivable balance to pay off. The ECL on the future \npayments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower \nthrough time using key borrower-specific factors and the \neconomic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all \nexpected payments in accordance with the Credit Card \nAccountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., \npaying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then \nforecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest \nbalance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off \namount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, \ndelinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key \ninputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. \nFuture draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL \nas they are unconditionally cancellable. \nThe ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also \ndetermined using quantitative methods supplemented with \n97  Bank of America", "start_char_idx": 3818, "end_char_idx": 7497, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efdea2aa-afd0-4d3b-938b-6ed2deb91490": {"__data__": {"id_": "efdea2aa-afd0-4d3b-938b-6ed2deb91490", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "036b2952-bf9f-492f-97cb-0d491257a5c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1c30a56d7ad599129ad50107e4eb64a9abea54d96ca11b927f91c2d26d2e62ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f7fc34a-3236-4b82-a6db-a1c3c70732eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ef1e19294da48d09850d9e34337dd21b2ecbc5b6c9b46cd75fd4075001778914", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2c539ac-2a82-48fd-bc19-da6ac36e10e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "560dcd36e8e2247d67f5cf03bdc91688d2673ed309410f4f84e8082c6c5e1939", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "92193daa3c9e6b4622c25a4832cd24ea6e3198ea4407d7373ae5a530d576502d", "text": "qualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates ECL \ngiving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics \nsuch as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio, \nunderlying collateral type and collateral value.\nCommercial\nThe ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that \nestimate credit losses over the loan\u2019s contractual life at an \nindividual loan level. The models use the contractual terms to \nforecast future principal cash flows while also considering \nexpected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as \nrevolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured \nby forecasting a borrower\u2019s draw and payment behavior over the \nremaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with \ncommercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the \nprimary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models \nconsider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio, \nnet operating income and debt service coverage, and captures \nvariations in behavior according to property type and region. The \noutlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and \nforecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators \nsuch as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL \nestimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss \nforecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to \ndifferent credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life \nof the asset based on the borrower\u2019s current credit risk rating, \nindustry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. \nThe severity of loss is determined based on the type of \ncollateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the \nborrower\u2019s industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic \nmarket. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the \neconomic outlook, and the model considers key economic \nvariables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, \ncorporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and \nequity market returns.\nIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the \nCorporation also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending \ncommitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, \nunfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, \nexcluding commitments accounted for under the fair value \noption. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using \nthe same models and methodologies as the funded exposure \nand are reported as reserves for unfunded lending \ncommitments.\nNonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and \nDelinquencies\nNonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and \nleases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans \naccounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not \nreported as nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed \nuncollectible, it is charged off against the allowance for credit \nlosses.  If the charged-off amount is later recovered, the amount \nis reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the \nrecovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net \ncharge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than charge-\noffs, net charge-offs are reported as a negative amount.\nIn accordance with the Corporation\u2019s policies, consumer real \nestate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home \nequity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and \nclassified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless \nrepayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through \nindividually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie \nMae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). \nResidential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as \nnonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on \nnonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the \nunderlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90 days past due \neven if the junior-lien loan is current.

Under these arrangements, the Corporation \nrecords right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease \ncommencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other \nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related \nlease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other \nliabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance \nSheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for \nwhich the Corporation made the short-term lease election. \nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the \nlease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment \nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nThe Corporation made an accounting policy election not to \nseparate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is \nor contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As \nsuch, lease payments represent payments on both lease and \nnon-lease components. At lease commencement, lease \nliabilities are recognized based on the present value of the \nremaining lease payments and discounted using the \nCorporation\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets \ninitially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments \nmade prior to lease commencement and for any lease \nincentives.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair \nvalue of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is \nreviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when \nevents or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the \nreporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or \none level below a business segment. \nThe Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting \nunit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured \nby allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, \nthe Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the \ncarrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the \nreporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for \nthe portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to \nthe reporting unit. \nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the \nCorporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine \nwhether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a \nreporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors \ninclude, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, \nindustry and market considerations, financial performance of \nthe respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and \nreporting-unit specific considerations. \nIf the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that \nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a \nquantitative assessment is performed. The Corporation has an \nunconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for \nany reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to \nperforming the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The \nCorporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment \nin any subsequent period.\nWhen performing the quantitative assessment, if the fair \nvalue of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of \nthe reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the \ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a \ngoodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by \n99  Bank of America", "start_char_idx": 3713, "end_char_idx": 7186, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c96aeaf3-7a85-44ca-8f87-3ab7a8e6c60c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c96aeaf3-7a85-44ca-8f87-3ab7a8e6c60c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "33288bc8-b5ef-4754-aac2-0887b4366d14", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "54f3f45f0d36ddc09bda6c3ca538c241e479ffe03d7866012d6952e551923a7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ff53df9-ec5c-4871-b326-a1b20db4cb97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "46056ff91cd38b6e6ef6b609954c0046c604c561ca36f87b3c491abaef9d80b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "891015b4-5148-4f00-9a67-c1c0fd3dba30", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "237db6060d3266768273d70cb8a4f5fe342f74f4006153acaf8194100b06cd1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f92b3c8bdb5900e0a00569e463f7978f96f2afa3321127ad69eed3f122c2ef15", "text": "which the reporting unit\u2019s allocated equity exceeds its fair value. \nAn impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of \ngoodwill assigned to a reporting unit.

The carrying value of the \nintangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the \nsum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the \nuse of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite \nuseful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss \nis recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an \nindefinite life exceeds its fair value. \nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity \ninvestors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity \nthrough their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates \na VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE \nthat most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance \nand an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive \nbenefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a \nquarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with \nthe VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing \ndocuments and its financial interests in the VIE. The \nconsolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is \ninvolved may change as a result of such reassessments.\nThe Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization \nactivities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt \nsecurities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is \nthe servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust, \nincluding non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, \ncredit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to \ndirect the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation \ngenerally does not have the power to direct the most significant \nactivities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain \ncircumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of \nthe issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the \ntrust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a \ncommercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the \nspecial servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate \nsecurities which embody certain controlling rights. The \nCorporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it \nhas the power to direct the most significant activities and also \nholds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual \narrangements, other than standard representations and \nwarranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.\nThe Corporation may also transfer trading account securities \nand AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization \ntrusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or \nresecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities \nof the trust such as the remarketing of the trust\u2019s liabilities or, if \nthere are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design \nof the trust, including the identification of securities to be \ntransferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and \nalso retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments \nthat could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation \ndoes not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if \none or a limited number of third-party investors share \nresponsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the \nsignificant activities of the trust through liquidation or other \nsubstantive rights.Other VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized \ndebt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf \nof customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation \ndoes not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, \ntherefore, does not typically have the power to direct the \nactivities that most significantly impact the economic \nperformance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if \nthe Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued \nby a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the \nCorporation consolidates the CDO.\nThe Corporation consolidates a customer or other \ninvestment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the \nvehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs \npotentially significant gains or losses through an investment in \nthe vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4798, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "891015b4-5148-4f00-9a67-c1c0fd3dba30": {"__data__": {"id_": "891015b4-5148-4f00-9a67-c1c0fd3dba30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "33288bc8-b5ef-4754-aac2-0887b4366d14", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "54f3f45f0d36ddc09bda6c3ca538c241e479ffe03d7866012d6952e551923a7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c96aeaf3-7a85-44ca-8f87-3ab7a8e6c60c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f92b3c8bdb5900e0a00569e463f7978f96f2afa3321127ad69eed3f122c2ef15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e8ce242b-5ee7-4ea9-84e8-a4e4098d9a78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "99d41cf4d079ca8abb6ddddf285e7c51bc701a5a7eaa9f63623d4f7a4c209353", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "237db6060d3266768273d70cb8a4f5fe342f74f4006153acaf8194100b06cd1c", "text": "The Corporation \ndoes not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, \ntherefore, does not typically have the power to direct the \nactivities that most significantly impact the economic \nperformance of a CDO.

In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt \nsecurities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these \ndebt securities, which are classified as trading account assets, \ndebt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based \nprimarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets. \nGenerally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests \nare not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair \nvalues based on the present value of the associated expected \nfuture cash flows.\nFair Value\nThe Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and \nliabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting \nguidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price. \nUnder this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use \nof observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \ninputs in measuring fair value. Under applicable accounting \nstandards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of \nthree levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with \nthe highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active \nmarkets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. \nThe Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements of \nfinancial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for \nidentical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and \nliabilities include debt and equity securities and \nderivative contracts that are traded in an active \nexchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury \nsecurities that are highly liquid and are actively traded \nin OTC markets.\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as \nquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted \nprices in markets that are not active, or other inputs \nthat are observable or can be corroborated by \nobservable market data for substantially the full term \nof the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and \nliabilities include debt securities with quoted prices \nthat are traded less frequently than exchange-traded \ninstruments and derivative contracts where fair value is \ndetermined using a pricing model with inputs that are \nobservable in the market or can be derived principally \nfrom or corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 assets \nand liabilities include financial instruments for which \nthe determination of fair value requires significant \nmanagement judgment or estimation. The fair value for \nsuch assets and liabilities is generally determined \nusing pricing models, discounted cash flow \nmethodologies or similar techniques that incorporate \nthe assumptions a market participant would use in \npricing the asset or liability. This category generally \nincludes retained residual interests in securitizations, \nconsumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, \ncomplex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain \nloans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where \nindependent pricing information cannot be obtained for \na significant portion of the underlying assets.\nIncome Taxes\nThere are two components of income tax expense: current and \ndeferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid \nor refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense \nresults from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities \nbetween periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities \nrepresent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid \nin the future because of future reversals of temporary \ndifferences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured \nby tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial \nstatements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax \nattributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax \ncredit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to \nreduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management \nconcludes are more likely than not to be realized.\nIncome tax benefits are recognized and measured based \nupon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely \nthan not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in \norder to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as \nthe largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than \nnot to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between \nthe benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax \nreturn is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The \nCorporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if \napplicable, within income tax expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following summarizes the Corporation\u2019s revenue recognition \naccounting policies for certain noninterest income activities.\nCard Income\nCard income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as \ninterchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items \nfrom credit and debit card transactions and from processing \ncard transactions for merchants. Card income is presented net \nof direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon \nsettlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions \nand are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit \ncards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the \ncorresponding payment network\u2019s rates. Substantially all card \nfees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain \ntime-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over \n12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that \nare estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards \nand credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders \nare related to points earned by the cardholder that can be \nredeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel \nand gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based \non past redemption behavior, card product type, account \ntransaction activity and other historical card performance. The \nliability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation \nalso makes payments to credit card partners.

The revenue is generally earned based on a \npercentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed. \nOnce the number of shares or notes is determined and the \nservice is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The \nCorporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal \ncosts, in performing these services.

Net \nincome allocated to common shareholders is net income \nadjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends \ndeclared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including \naccelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and \ncumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that \nhave not been declared as of period end, less income allocated \nto participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing \nincome allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on \ndilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can \nbe tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average \ncommon shares outstanding plus amounts representing the \ndilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock, \nrestricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the \ndilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred \nstock, if applicable.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and \nsubsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of \neach entity.

(ISDA) master netting agreements or similar \nagreements with substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s derivative \ncounterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting \nagreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the \ncounterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral \nand to offset receivables and payables with the same \ncounterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, \nthe Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash \ncollateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a \nlegally enforceable master netting agreement.\nThe following table presents derivative instruments included \nin derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December\u00a0 31, 2022 and 2021 by primary risk (e.g., \ninterest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which \nthese derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a \ngross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash \ncollateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities \nare adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration \nthe effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, \nwhich include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and \ncash collateral received or paid.\nFor more information on offsetting of securities financing \nagreements, see Note 10 \u2013 Securities Financing Agreements, \nShort-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash .\n105  Bank of America", "start_char_idx": 1996, "end_char_idx": 4157, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9868c89d-0a45-41f4-bf7b-98da37e4ec9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9868c89d-0a45-41f4-bf7b-98da37e4ec9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b0149f19-5102-44f9-93b5-4875ab6bd041", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "03daa056e144144837e7e46864a9512e835a8c408f2fafaa3885b166bf4fba36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "83b9371c-5989-4fa0-9caa-dc5f7fdc2ad3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ffda939e27b1a4a832e80fba0a0e81ded410157bdd687b2c029c3c5ea586a608", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c9c8199-73cd-48af-bdc0-42f5b371bac7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b85a27a39b4d01f388ce1401715d5e97b4e85d440072c48f64944932ab804e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f071f723c8e9d249475dbb897794dc8a8e5c1d4fb0d6b727a1effc963292349d", "text": "Offsetting of Derivatives (1)\nDerivative \nAssetsDerivative\n LiabilitiesDerivative \nAssetsDerivative\n Liabilities\n(Dollars in billions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nInterest rate contracts \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nOver-the-counter $ 138.4 $ 132.3 $ 171.3 $ 166.3 \nExchange-traded  0.4  0.1  0.2  \u2014 \nOver-the-counter cleared  71.4  71.1  22.6  22.5 \nForeign exchange contracts\nOver-the-counter  109.7  110.6  67.9  70.5 \nOver-the-counter cleared  1.3  1.2  1.1  1.1 \nEquity contracts\nOver-the-counter  21.5  22.6  29.2  32.9 \nExchange-traded  33.0  33.8  38.3  38.4 \nCommodity contracts\nOver-the-counter  8.3  9.3  6.1  7.6 \nExchange-traded  2.4  1.9  1.4  1.3 \nOver-the-counter cleared  0.3  0.3  0.1  0.1 \nCredit derivatives\nOver-the-counter  8.9  7.5  5.2  5.3 \nOver-the-counter cleared  \u2014  \u2014  1.8  1.8 \nTotal gross derivative assets/liabilities, before netting\nOver-the-counter  286.8  282.3  279.7  282.6 \nExchange-traded  35.8  35.8  39.9  39.7 \nOver-the-counter cleared  73.0  72.6  25.6  25.5 \nLess: Legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral received/paid\nOver-the-counter  (243.8)  (248.2)  (250.3)  (254.6) \nExchange-traded  (33.5)  (33.5)  (37.8)  (37.8) \nOver-the-counter cleared  (72.4)  (72.0)  (25.0)  (25.4) \nDerivative assets/liabilities, after netting  45.9  37.0  32.1  30.0 \nOther gross derivative assets/liabilities (2) 2.7  7.8  3.2  7.7 \nTotal derivative assets/liabilities  48.6  44.8  35.3  37.7 \nLess: Financial instruments collateral (3) (18.5)  (7.4)  (11.8)  (10.6) \nTotal net derivative assets/liabilities $ 30.1 $ 37.4 $ 23.5 $ 27.1 \n(1)Over-the-counter derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a particular counterparty.

The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage interest rate \nsensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do \nnot significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result \nof interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and \nliabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value.

The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as \ninterest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement \ncontracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks \nof MSRs. \nThe Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage \nthe foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign \ncurrency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the \nCorporation\u2019s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Credit derivatives include credit default swaps \n(CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are \nrecorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with \nchanges in fair value recorded in other income.\nDerivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges\nThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign \nexchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the \nfair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in \ninterest rates and foreign exchange rates (fair value hedges). \nThe Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect \nagainst changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, \nBank of America  106", "start_char_idx": 2263, "end_char_idx": 5666, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0e8cdb7-379f-46f7-98e7-3e8e2554b235": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0e8cdb7-379f-46f7-98e7-3e8e2554b235", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27cf4298-4b0d-44a2-99d3-6d24f0764ff8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "759d62d4cd48ac7d4364a8983ed083cea00b98ebe2442abe6ee00d41b6b999da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c9c8199-73cd-48af-bdc0-42f5b371bac7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3b85a27a39b4d01f388ce1401715d5e97b4e85d440072c48f64944932ab804e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1243625a-3c40-4875-ac03-4eaf1abd9297", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "987a8f33a3b424f573d49e3fbe0da100701a990bb43dd1f0a12f7dd050806656", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1f901ae13c7103230132a49ecb29fb3ba91265689056b74952746fb6497fb0a2", "text": "and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges).

Of the $11.9 billion after-tax net loss ($15.9 billion \npretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at December\u00a0 31, \n2022, losses of $4.4 billion after-tax ($5.9 billion pretax) \nrelated to both open and terminated cash flow hedges are \nexpected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. \nThese   net   losses   reclassified   into  earnings  are  expected to primarily decrease net interest income related to the \nrespective hedged items. For open cash flow hedges, the \nmaximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are \nhedged is approximately seven years. For terminated cash flow \nhedges, the time period over which the forecasted transactions \nwill be recognized in interest income is approximately five years, \nwith the aggregated amount beyond this time period being \ninsignificant.\nGains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges\nGains (Losses) Recognized in \nAccumulated OCI on DerivativesGains (Losses) in Income \nReclassified from Accumulated OCI\n(Dollars in millions, amounts pretax) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nCash flow hedges\nInterest rate risk on variable-rate portfolios (1)$ (13,492) $ (2,686) $ 763 $ (338) $ 148 $ (7) \nPrice risk on forecasted MBS purchases (1) (129)  (249)  241  11  26  9 \nPrice risk on certain compensation plans (2) (88)  93  85  29  55  12 \nTotal $ (13,709) $ (2,842) $ 1,089 $ (298) $ 229 $ 14 \nNet investment hedges\nForeign exchange risk (3) $ 1,710 $ 1,451 $ (834) $ 3 $ 23 $ 4 \n(1)Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n(2)Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n(3)Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

At both December\u00a031, 2022 \nand 2021, the Corporation had transferred $4.8 billion of non-\nU.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a \nthird-party trust and retained economic exposure to the \ntransferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection \nwith these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash \nproceeds of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion at the transfer dates. \nAt December\u00a0 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the \ntransferred securities was $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion.\nSales and Trading Revenue\nThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client \ntransactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading \naccount assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation\u2019s policy to \ninclude these derivative instruments in its trading activities, \nwhich include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. \nThe resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a \nportfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2019s Global Markets  \nbusiness segment. The related sales and trading revenue \ngenerated within Global Markets  is recorded in various income \nstatement line items, including market making and similar \nactivities and net interest income as well as other revenue \ncategories.\nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value \nand realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other \nassets, net interest income, and fees primarily from \ncommissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the \ndifference in the client price for an instrument and the price at \nwhich the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer \nmarket. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases \nand sales are recorded in the \u201cOther\u201d column in the Sales and \nTrading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these \nsecurities are included in market making and similar activities. \nFor debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest \nassociated with the debt securities, is typically included in \nmarket making and similar activities. Unlike commissions for \nequity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of \nthe instrument rather than being charged through separate fee \narrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in market \nmaking and similar activities as part of the initial mark to fair \nvalue. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in  \nmarket making and similar activities. In transactions where the \nCorporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded \nfutures and options, fees are recorded in other income. \nThe table below, which includes both derivatives and non-\nderivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the \nrespective income statement line items attributable to the \nCorporation\u2019s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets , \ncategorized by primary risk, for 2022, 2021 and 2020.

The Corporation is not obligated to \nmake any payments to the entities under the terms of the \nsecurities owned.\nCredit-related Contingent Features and Collateral\nThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts \nin the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, \nincluding broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety \nof non-financial companies. A significant majority of the \nderivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. \nTherefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending \non the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants \nwould typically require an increase in the amount of collateral \nrequired of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the \nCorporation to take additional protective measures such as \nearly termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed \non page 105, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable \nmaster netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting \ncloseout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty \nupon the occurrence of certain events.\nCertain of the Corporation\u2019s derivative contracts contain \ncredit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of \nISDA master netting agreements and credit support \ndocumentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these \ninstruments compared to other obligations of the respective \ncounterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These \ncontingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as \nwell as its counterparties with respect to changes in the \nCorporation\u2019s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure \nunder the derivative transactions. At December\u00a0 31, 2022 and \n2021, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of \n$101.3 billion and $91.4 billion and posted cash and securities \ncollateral of $81.2 billion and $79.3 billion in the normal course \nof business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-\nproduct margining agreements where clients are permitted to \nmargin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing \narrangements.\nIn connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other \ntrading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide \nadditional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain \ncounterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt \nratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of \nadditional collateral required depends on the contract and is \nusually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of \nthe exposure.\nAt December\u00a031, 2022, the amount of collateral, calculated \nbased on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and \ncertain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties \nbut had not yet posted to counterparties was $3.2 billion, \nincluding $1.6 billion for Bank of America, National Association \n(BANA).\nSome counterparties are currently able to unilaterally \nterminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain \nsubsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a \nsuitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At December\u00a0 31, \n2022 and 2021, the liability recorded for these derivative \ncontracts was not significant. \nThe following table presents the amount of additional \ncollateral   that   would   have   been   contractually  required  by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at \nDecember\u00a031, 2022 if the rating agencies had downgraded their \nlong-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain \nsubsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional \nsecond incremental notch.

CVA \ngains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the \nderivative assets balance. DVA gains increase the cumulative \nDVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA \nand DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to \nderivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing \nthe derivative assets balance. FVA gains related to derivative \nliabilities increase the cumulative FVA thereby decreasing the \nderivative liabilities balance.

Within the \nConsumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit \nquality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed Fair Isaac \nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying \nvalue of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property \nsecuring the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are \nevaluated using CLTV, which measures the carrying value of the \nCorporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit combined with any \noutstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of \nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. \nFICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower \nbased on the financial obligations of the borrower and the \nborrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed \nquarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers \nthat have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may \nnot have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other \nConsumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio \nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial \nportfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal \nclassifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the \nprimary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized \nrefers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or \nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or \nDoubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by \nregulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of \nrisk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. \nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable \ncriticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, \nthe Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain \ntypes of loans.\nThe following tables present certain credit quality indicators \nand gross charge-offs for the Corporation's Consumer Real \nEstate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial \nportfolio segments by year of origination, except for revolving \nloans and revolving loans that were modified into term loans, \nwhich are shown on an aggregate basis at December\u00a031, 2022. \nBank of America  116", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4043,

Instead, the interest rates \nare typically increased, although the increased rate may not \nrepresent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions \nmay also include principal forgiveness in connection with \nforeclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading \nto termination or sale of the loan.\nAt the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to \nreflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from \nthe modified terms.

These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables \nsuch as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real \nestate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that \nare chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each \nscenario depend on a variety of factors including recent \neconomic events, leading economic indicators, internal and \nthird-party economist views, and industry trends. For more \ninformation on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies \nincluding the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary \nof Significant Accounting Principles .\nThe December\u00a0 31, 2022 estimate for allowance for credit \nlosses was based on various economic scenarios, including a \nbaseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an \nadverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a \ndownside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest \nrates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to \nthe severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an \nupside scenario that considers the potential for improvement \nabove the baseline scenario. The overall economic outlook is \nweighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in \n2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower \nGDP and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared \nto the prior year. The weighted economic outlook assumes that \nthe U.S. average unemployment rate will be above five and a \nhalf percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 and will slowly decline \nto five percent by the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, in this \neconomic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product is forecasted to \ncontract at 0.4 percent and grow at 1.2 percent year-over-year in \nthe fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024. For comparison, as of \nDecember 31, 2021, the weighted economic outlook for the \nU.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted to be just \nabove five percent by the fourth quarter of 2022 and slowly \ndecline to just under five percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 \nand U.S. gross domestic product was forecasted at 2.1 percent \nand 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022 \nand 2023.\nThe allowance for credit losses at December\u00a031, 2022 was \n$14.2 billion, an increase of $379\u00a0 million compared to \nDecember\u00a0 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit \nlosses was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened \nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for \nreduced pandemic uncertainties. The change in the allowance \nfor credit losses was comprised of a net increase of $295 \nmillion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and an \nincrease of $84 million in the reserve for unfunded lending \ncommitments. The increase in the allowance for credit losses \nwas attributed to increases in the credit card and other \nconsumer portfolios of $341 million, and commercial portfolio of \n$177 million, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer real \nestate portfolio of $139 million. The provision for credit losses \nincreased $7.1 billion to an expense of $2.5 billion in 2022 \ncompared to a benefit of $4.6 billion in 2021 and an expense of \n$11.3 billion in 2020. The increase in the provision for credit \nlosses in 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a \ndampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced \npandemic uncertainties. The benefit in 2021 was primarily due \nto an improved macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for \nunder the fair value option increased $68.7 billion in 2022 \nprimarily driven by commercial loans, which increased $47.7 \nbillion, driven by broad-based growth, and consumer loans which \n123  Bank of America", "start_char_idx": 3090,

Except as described in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and \nContingencies , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or \nrecourse to the securitization trusts other than standard \nrepresentations and warranties. \nThe table below summarizes select information related to \nfirst-lien mortgage securitizations for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nFirst-lien Mortgage Securitizations\n \nResidential Mortgage - Agency Commercial Mortgage\n(Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nProceeds from loan sales (1)$ 8,084 $ 6,664 $ 15,823 $ 5,853 $ 10,874 $ 5,084 \nGains on securitizations\u00a0(2) 8  9  728  46  156  61 \nRepurchases from securitization trusts (3) 53  756  436  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \n(1)The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored primarily by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and primarily receives residential mortgage-\nbacked securities in exchange. Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.\n(2)A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to \nsecuritization, which totaled $41 million, $121 million and $160 million net of hedges, during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are not included in the table above.\n(3)The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also \nrepurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or \nsecuritization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid \nprincipal balance of loans serviced for investors, including \nresidential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $100.1 \nbillion and $115.4 billion at December\u00a0 31, 2022 and 2021. \nServicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was \n$274 million, $392 million and $474 million during 2022, 2021 \nand 2020, respectively. Servicing advances on serviced loans, \nincluding loans serviced for others and loans held for \ninvestment, were $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion  at  December\u00a031, \n2022 and 2021.

In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to \nprovide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid \namortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum \nloss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will \nultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization \nevents depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines \nof credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent \ndraws and the timing of related cash flows. \nCredit Card Securitizations\nThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card \nloans. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the \nsecuritization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining \nan undivided interest (seller\u2019s interest) in the receivables, and \nholding certain retained interests, including subordinate \ninterests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized \nreceivables and cash reserve accounts. \nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation issued new \nsenior debt securities to third-party investors from the credit  \ncard securitization trust totaling $2.3 billion, $1.0 billion, and \n$1.0 billion, respectively.\nAt December\u00a0 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation held \nsubordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization \ntrust with a notional principal amount of $6.7 billion and $6.5 \nbillion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement \nto the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of \nzero percent. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the credit card \nsecuritization trust issued $363 million, $161 million and $161 \nmillion, respectively, of these subordinate securities.\nResecuritization Trusts\nThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into \nresecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers \nseeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there \nare no significant ongoing activities performed in a \nresecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral \nability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $21.8 billion, $28.9 billion \nand $39.0 billion of securities during 2022, 2021 and 2020, \nrespectively. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs \nwere measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded \nin market making and similar activities prior to the \nresecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was \nrecorded. Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs were \nrecognized at their fair value of $2.4 billion, $2.2 billion and \n$6.1 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022 \nand 2021, substantially all of the securities were classified as \ntrading account assets. All of the securities received as \nresecuritization proceeds during 2020 were classified as trading \naccount assets.  Of the securities received as resecuritization \nproceeds during 2020, $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion \nwere classified as trading account assets, debt securities \ncarried at fair value and HTM securities, respectively. \nSubstantially all of the trading account securities carried at fair \nvalue were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nMunicipal Bond Trusts\nThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold \nhighly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts \nobtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that \nreprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party \ninvestors.\nThe Corporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated \nmunicipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation \nwas transferor, totaled $2.5 billion and $4.1 billion at \nDecember\u00a031, 2022 and 2021.

At December\u00a0 31, 2022 and \n2021, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $4.3 billion and $6.3 billion.

The \nindemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms \nand were entered into in the normal course of business based \non an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These \nagreements typically contain an early termination clause that \npermits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these \nevents. The maximum potential future payment under \nindemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several \nreasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the \ninability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the \ndifficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in \ncontracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard \ncontract language and the timing of any early termination \nclauses. Historically, any payments made under these \nguarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has \nassessed the probability of making such payments in the future \nas remote.\nMerchant Services\nThe Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor \nof other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed \ncharges that cannot be collected from the merchants, due to, \namong other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are \nproperly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from \neither the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation \nmay be held liable for these reversed charges.

The total amount of transactions subject to reversal \nunder payment network rules and regulations processed for the \npreceding six-month period, which was approximately $501 \nbillion, is an estimate of the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential \nexposure as of December\u00a031, 2022. The Corporation\u2019s risk in \nthis area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder \nhas purchased goods or services for future delivery. The \nCorporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, \nguarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from \ncertain merchants. The Corporation\u2019s reserves for contingent \nlosses and the losses incurred related to the merchant  \nprocessing activity were not significant. \nExchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees\nThe Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative \nexchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other \ncountries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay \na pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these \norganizations as a result of another member default and under \nother loss scenarios. The Corporation\u2019s potential obligations \nmay be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges \nand clearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the \nCorporation\u2019s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited \ninstances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after \napplying the guarantee fund. The Corporation\u2019s maximum \npotential exposure under these membership agreements is \ndifficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the \nprobability of making any such payments as remote.\nPrime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services\nIn connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses, \nthe Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement \nservices with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on \nbehalf of its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation \nstands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect \nto securities transactions. The Corporation\u2019s obligations in this \nrespect are secured by the assets in the clients\u2019 accounts and \nthe accounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds \nreceived from the transactions cleared and settled by the \nCorporation on behalf of clients or their customers. The \nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure under these \narrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for \nthe Corporation to incur material losses pursuant to these \narrangements is remote.\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member \nRepo Program\nThe Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo \nprogram whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale \nand repurchase agreements through the Government Securities \nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of \nclients that are sponsored members in accordance with the \nFixed Income Clearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of this \nprogram, the Corporation guarantees the payment and \nperformance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income \nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s guarantee obligation is \nsecured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities \ncollateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, \nthe potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses \nunder this arrangement is remote.

Future \nrepresentations and warranties losses may occur in excess of \nthe amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the \nCorporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the \nCorporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and \nRegulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range \nof possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations \nand warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its \nsubsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many \npending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental \nactions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of \npredicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the \nclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where \nthe matters present novel legal theories or involve a large \nnumber of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the \neventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate \nresolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties \nrelated to each pending matter.\nAs a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with \nany outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether \nsuch matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and \nestimable, and, for the matters below, whether a loss in excess \nof any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. \nOnce the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and \nestimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and \nrecord a corresponding amount of expense. The Corporation \ncontinues to monitor the matter for further developments that \ncould affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been \npreviously established. Excluding expenses of internal and \nexternal legal service providers, litigation and regulatory \ninvestigation-related expense of $1.2 billion and $164 million \nwas recognized in 2022 and 2021.\nFor any matter disclosed in this Note for which a loss in \nfuture periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in \nexcess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued \nliability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the \nCorporation\u2019s estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $0.8 \nbillion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of \nDecember\u00a031, 2022. \nThe accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss \nare based upon currently available information and subject to \nsignificant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and \nunknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued \nliability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable \nand may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary \nsignificantly from the current estimate and accrual. The \nestimated range of possible loss does not represent the \nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided below regarding the nature of the \nlitigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages. \nBased on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued \nliabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies \narising from pending matters, including the matters described \nbelow, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated \nfinancial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in \nlight of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and \nuncertainties involved in those matters, some of which are \nbeyond the Corporation\u2019s control, and the very large or \nindeterminate damages sought in some of those matters, an \nadverse outcome in one or more of those matters could be material to the Corporation\u2019s business or results of operations \nfor any particular reporting period, or cause significant \nreputational harm. \nDeposit Insurance Assessment\nOn January 9, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \n(FDIC) filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia (\u201cDistrict Court\u201d) alleging failure to pay a \nDecember 15, 2016 invoice for additional deposit insurance \nassessments and interest in the amount of $542\u00a0million for the \nquarters ending June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014.\nOn April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a \nclaim for additional deposit insurance and interest in the \namount of $583\u00a0million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 \nthrough March 31, 2013.

Bank of America California, \nN.A. can pay dividends of $173 million in 2023 plus an \nadditional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2023 up \nto the date of any such dividend declaration.\nNOTE 17\u00a0 Employee Benefit Plans\nPension and Postretirement Plans\nThe Corporation sponsors a qualified noncontributory trusteed \npension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of \nnoncontributory nonqualified pension plans and postretirement \nhealth and life plans that cover eligible employees. Non-U.S. pension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the \ncountry and local practices.\nThe Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature \nfor account balances with participant-selected investments, \napplied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan \nthat effectively provides principal protection for participant \nbalances transferred and certain compensation credits. The \nCorporation is responsible for funding any shortfall on the \nguarantee feature.\nBenefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have been \nfrozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn \ninvestment credits or interest credits in accordance with the \nterms of the plan document. \nThe Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the \npayment of benefits vested under a terminated U.S. pension \nplan (Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a \nsupplemental agreement, may be responsible for or benefit from \nactual experience and investment performance of the annuity \nassets. The Corporation made no contribution under this \nagreement in 2022 or 2021. Contributions may be required in \nthe future under this agreement.\nThe Corporation\u2019s noncontributory, nonqualified pension \nplans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension \nbenefits to certain eligible employees.\nIn addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefits-\neligible employees may become eligible to continue participation \nas retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored \nby the Corporation. These plans are referred to as the \nPostretirement Health and Life Plans. \nThe Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the \nchanges in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the \nprojected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the \naccumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the \nweighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit \nobligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4587, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d39180d4-9dbb-4e97-a33d-67a26fc5d9a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "d39180d4-9dbb-4e97-a33d-67a26fc5d9a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93af6264-cf28-4072-be7f-438cc8dd07e5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "fc40ef0111760fb5d6a2a8f49dd716ca2c247da6d214ff0d06213d1dd316a5b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9fd8e893-04ce-4e6c-b3b8-e2511bedb7fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f30a637e35e83a8a34031058c9fd0798a7958f87cd8be9e536067740301b8446", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8758ee81-b8e6-4641-8059-4c27b58ed219", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "325dbe1232d0e1eb3d7ab0f04d7ab5ef332fb44f8138cd7242df82459cf40a5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cb6ab79ab5e21b6735c169436ca2b16ed24676564317ef04506a518d97bf93b5", "text": "Contributions may be required in \nthe future under this agreement.\nThe Corporation\u2019s noncontributory, nonqualified pension \nplans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension \nbenefits to certain eligible employees.\nIn addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefits-\neligible employees may become eligible to continue participation \nas retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored \nby the Corporation.

The Corporation\u2019s policy is to invest the trust \nassets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of \nproviding benefits to participants and defraying reasonable \nexpenses of administration. The Corporation\u2019s investment \nstrategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long \nterm, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy \nattempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level \nof risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying \nwith ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The \ninvestment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal \ndeterminant for establishing the risk/return profile of the \nassets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically \nreviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability \ncharacteristics change. Active and passive investment \nmanagers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile \nof the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy \nused to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes \nmatching the exposure of participant-selected investment \nmeasures. \nThe assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily \nattributable to a U.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan\u2019s \nassets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to \nmembers are provided with consideration given to the nature \nand the duration of the plans\u2019 liabilities. The selected asset allocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than \nthe lowest risk strategy.\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was \ndeveloped through analysis of historical market returns, \nhistorical asset class volatility and correlations, current market \nconditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds\u2019 past \nexperience and expectations on potential future market returns. \nThe expected return on plan assets assumption is determined \nusing the calculated market-related value for the Qualified \nPension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for \nthe Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life \nPlans. The expected return on plan assets assumption \nrepresents a long-term average view of the performance of the \nassets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension \nPlans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and \nLife Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any \none calendar year. The Other Pension Plan is invested solely in \nan annuity contract, which is primarily invested in fixed-income \nsecurities structured such that asset maturities match the \nduration of the plan\u2019s obligations.\nThe target allocations for 2023 by asset category for the \nQualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and \nNonqualified and Other Pension Plans are presented in the table \nbelow. Equity securities for the Qualified Pension Plan include \ncommon stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $296 \nmillion (1.72 percent of total plan assets) and $398 million \n(1.80 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2022 and \n2021.\n2023 Target Allocation\nPercentage\nAsset CategoryQualified\nPension PlanNon-U.S.\nPension PlansNonqualified\nand Other\nPension Plans\nEquity securities 15 - 50% 0 - 20% 0 - 5%\nDebt securities 45 - 80% 40 - 75% 95 - 100%\nReal estate 0 - 10% 0 - 15% 0 - 5%\nOther 0 - 5% 10 - 40% 0 - 5%\nFair Value Measurements\nFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level\u00a01, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the \nvaluation methods employed by the Corporation, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles  and Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value \nMeasurements .

The Corporation recorded expense \nof $1.2 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020 related to the qualified \ndefined contribution plans. At  December 31, 2022 and 2021, \n179 million and 173 million shares of the Corporation\u2019s \ncommon stock were held by these plans. Payments to the plans \nfor dividends on common stock were $153 million, $139 million \nand $138 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCertain non-U.S. employees are covered under defined \ncontribution pension plans that are separately administered in \naccordance with local laws.\nNOTE 18  Stock-based Compensation Plans\nThe Corporation administers a number of equity compensation \nplans, with awards being granted predominantly from the Bank \nof America Corporation Equity Plan (BACEP). Under this plan, \n715\u00a0 million shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock are \nauthorized to be used for grants of awards.\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Corporation granted 102 million \nand 99 million RSU awards to certain employees under the \nBACEP. These RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in \nshares of common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will \nbe settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject \nthese awards to variable accounting whereby compensation \nexpense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share \nprice of the Corporation\u2019s common stock up to the settlement \ndate. The RSUs granted in 2022 will generally vest over four \nyears. Of the RSUs granted in 2021, 81 million will generally \nvest over four years and 18 million will vest over three years. \nThe four-year awards vest primarily in one-fourth increments on \neach of the first four anniversaries of the grant date while the \nthree-year awards vest primarily in one-third increments on each \nof the first three anniversaries of the grant date, provided that \nthe employee remains continuously employed with the \nCorporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over \nthe vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non-\nretirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value \nof the shares. Of the RSUs granted in 2022 and 2021 that vest \nover four years, 39 million and 27 million do not include \nretirement eligibility. For all other RSUs granted to employees \nwho are retirement eligible, they are deemed authorized as of \nthe beginning of the year preceding the grant date when the \nincentive award plans are generally approved.  As a result, the \nestimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the \ngrant date. The compensation cost for the stock-based plans \nwas $2.9 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.1 billion, and the related \nincome tax benefit was $697 million, $723 million and $505 \nmillion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At \nDecember\u00a0 31, 2022, there was an estimated $3.6 billion of \ntotal unrecognized compensation cost related to certain share-\nbased compensation awards that is expected to be recognized \nover a period of up to four years, with a weighted-average period \nof 2.7 years.Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nThe total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units \nvested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $3.4 billion, $2.3 billion \nand $2.3 billion, respectively.

However, a material change in those estimates could \nlead management to reassess such valuation allowance \nconclusions.\nAt December\u00a0 31, 2022, U.S. federal income taxes had not \nbeen provided on approximately $5.0 billion of temporary \ndifferences associated with investments in non-U.S. \nsubsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration.\u00a0 If the \nCorporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability, \nthe amount would be approximately $1.0 billion.NOTE 20\u00a0 Fair Value Measurements\nUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as \nthe exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid \nto transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most \nadvantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants on the measurement \ndate. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial \ninstruments under applicable accounting standards that require \nan entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize \nthe use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its \nfinancial instruments into three levels based on the established \nfair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy \nclassifications on a quarterly basis.

While the Corporation \nbelieves its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent \nwith other market participants, the use of different \nmethodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of \ncertain financial instruments could result in a different estimate \nof fair value at the reporting date.\nDuring 2022, there were no significant changes to valuation \napproaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a \nmaterial impact on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial \nposition or results of operations.\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities\nThe fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are \nprimarily based on actively traded markets where prices are \nbased on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. \nThe fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted \nmarket prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a \nsignificant factor in the determination of the fair values of \ntrading account assets and liabilities and debt securities. \nMarket price quotes may not be readily available for some \npositions such as positions within a market sector where \ntrading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of \nthese instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow \nmodel, which estimates the fair value of the securities using \ninternal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk \nmodels that incorporate management\u2019s best estimate of current \nkey assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and \nprepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are \ndiscounted using an observable discount rate for similar \ninstruments with adjustments that management believes a \nmarket participant would consider in determining fair value for \nthe specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net \nasset value approach which considers the value of the \nunderlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using \nexternal pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing \nbased on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity \ngenerally are triggered by the market\u2019s perception of credit \nuncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market \nsector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on \nlimited available market information and other factors, \nBank of America  148", "start_char_idx": 3266, "end_char_idx": 6694, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f38cbc5f-d110-4cd2-aa69-64f5b5c7cf03": {"__data__": {"id_": "f38cbc5f-d110-4cd2-aa69-64f5b5c7cf03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "483d750b-e634-4445-b899-184a1aa36a57", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e657e529916674e604d337f5dbec7f96cca243d74d4ba77873628a1a00da8c15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8daf1c25-6626-4f40-89e1-126a6eee0ea3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "150", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "25ad40b631697db58f9f4fc812049413f05330af79347cf6b87bcb8d791eb560", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe20fd2f-ead3-4b48-b5af-59d313057eab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6eba5755d0c675db313e1942b3909d92c7cf8f01f418e1697e79d49c28982f80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "31dd44c5b5f7b6831f26e908504e17529ac73f40168b022c453c9b858fe7aabb", "text": "principally from reviewing the issuer\u2019s financial statements and \nchanges in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the \nOTC market are determined using quantitative models that \nutilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and \nindices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and \nvolatility factors to value the position. The majority of market \ninputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external \nsources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party \npricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the \nmethods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. \nEstimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability \npositions that are either option-based or have longer maturity \ndates where observable market inputs are less readily available, \nor are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based \nextrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in \ndetermining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and \nliabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty \ncredit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where \nappropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its \nfair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation \nadjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net \nposition. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for \nnet long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while \nthe fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the \nCorporation\u2019s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates \nFVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs \non uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the \nCorporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An \nestimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of \nfair value, primarily based on market data.\nLoans and Loan Commitments\nThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on \nmarket prices, where available, or discounted cash flow \nanalyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt \ninstruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or \ncomparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow \nanalyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other \nmarket conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an \noption-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in \nprepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This \napproach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under \nmultiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash \nflows using risk-adjusted discount rates. Loans Held-for-sale\nThe fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, \nwhere available, or are determined by discounting estimated \ncash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation\u2019s \ncurrent origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the \ninherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is \nembedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by \nconsidering loan performance when selecting comparables.\nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons \nor repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity \nsecurities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities. \nThe fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using \nquantitative models for the combined derivative and debt \nportions of the notes. These models incorporate observable \nand, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security \nprices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, \ncommodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. \nThe Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit \nspread in determining the discount rate used to value these \nliabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to \nobservable spreads in the secondary bond market.\nSecurities Financing Agreements\nThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements, \nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions \nare determined using quantitative models, including discounted \ncash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs \nincluding interest rates and spreads to generate continuous \nyield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of \nmarket inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through \nexternal sources, including brokers, market transactions and \nthird-party pricing services.\nDeposits\nThe fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative \nmodels, including discounted cash flow models that require the \nuse of multiple market inputs including interest rates and \nspreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and \nvolatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively \nquoted and can be validated through external sources, including \nbrokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. \nThe Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in \nthe valuation of these liabilities.

Commercial loans, debt \nsecurities and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs, \ncommercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real \nestate assets. Structured liabilities primarily include equity-\nlinked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.\nThe Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing \ncertain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market \ncomparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For \na given product, such as corporate debt securities, market \ncomparables may be used to estimate some of the \nunobservable inputs, and then these inputs are incorporated \ninto a discounted cash flow model. Therefore, the balances \ndisclosed encompass both of these techniques.\nThe levels of aggregation and diversity within the products \ndisclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being \nwide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability \ncategories.\nUncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from \nUnobservable Inputs\nLoans and Securities\nA significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss \nseverities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower \nfair value for long positions. Short positions would have been \nimpacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes \nin prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts \ndepending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of \nCLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A significant \nincrease in price would have resulted in a significantly higher \nfair value for long positions, and short positions would have \nbeen impacted in a directionally opposite way.\nStructured Liabilities and Derivatives\nFor credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield, \nupfront points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates or \nloss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair \nvalue for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection \nbuyers. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would \nhave resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of \nthe instrument.\nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit \ncorrelation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the \ndegree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit \nportfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The \nsensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the \nlevel of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that \nare net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default \ncorrelation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair \nvalue. Net short protection positions would have been impacted \nin a directionally opposite way. \nFor equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate \nderivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in \nlong-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the \ndegree of correlation between an equity security and an index, \nbetween two different commodities, between two different \ninterest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange \nrates) would have resulted in a significant impact to the fair \nvalue; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact \ndepend on whether the Corporation is long or short the \nexposure. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield \nor decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower \nfair value.\nNonrecurring Fair Value \nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair \nvalue only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an \nasset), and these measurements are referred to herein as \nnonrecurring.

These \ncredit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation \nas accounting hedges and are carried at fair value. The fair \nvalue option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and \nloan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with \nmanagement\u2019s view of the underlying economics and the \nmanner in which they are managed. In addition, the fair value \noption allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility \nthat would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by \naccounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and \nthe credit derivatives at fair value.\nLoans Held-for-sale\nThe Corporation elects to account for residential mortgage \nLHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under \nthe fair value option. These loans are actively managed and \nmonitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans \nmay be mitigated through the use of derivatives. The \nCorporation has elected not to designate the derivatives as \nqualifying  accounting  hedges, and therefore, they are carried at fair value. The changes in fair value of the loans are largely \noffset by changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The fair \nvalue option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting \nvolatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created \nby accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost \nor fair value and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation \nhas not elected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair \nvalue option primarily because these loans are floating-rate \nloans that are not hedged using derivative instruments.\nLoans Reported as Trading Account Assets\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held \nfor the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value \nbasis under the fair value option.\nOther Assets\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate \nmargin loans that are hedged with derivatives under the fair \nvalue option. Election of the fair value option allows the \nCorporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would \notherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for \nthe financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at \nfair value.\nSecurities Financing Agreements\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain securities \nfinancing agreements, including resale and repurchase \nagreements, under the fair value option. These elections include \ncertain agreements collateralized by the U.S. government and \nits agencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal \ninterest rate risk.\n157  Bank of America", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4541, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b82e3e1f-59ed-4b78-aade-5adc544dfe27": {"__data__": {"id_": "b82e3e1f-59ed-4b78-aade-5adc544dfe27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd6538b9-21cf-4db1-8888-6f8c444986e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8a2a6bdabe538ff411cf2be827173bcc81d9a3d403a3b23529e05d2d8b6d1be5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7afd3ed-c0ed-473a-b5a7-cbcdb293ff82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "60d32e58af9f5d7ab0006d4585b43510f8857c779bc38b755cec300f9f238dd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "70fe305b-12cb-4838-95ee-8f06672a4461", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "80be5b52cc2366614e082cec8c4a052289c6179ba575c2796835a1b0c1ccfeab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "81aab8b9a2b8aa40b5a194510f9ce864af41f809cd428a1f57f49c60e4484cb3", "text": "Long-term Deposits\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate \nand rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do \nnot qualify for hedge accounting.

The net interest \nincome of the businesses includes the results of a funds \ntransfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with \nsimilar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In \nsegments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds \nassets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the \nCorporation allocates assets to match liabilities.

Stock dividends, if any are declared, may be paid fro m the Company\u2019s authorized but \nunissued shares of Common Stock.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Matters\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and of the Restated Certific ate of Incorporation and \nBylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company or have \nthe effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acq uire control of the Company.  For \nexample, the Company is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, \nwhich would make it more difficult for another party to acquire  the Company without the \napproval of the Board.  Certain provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and \nBylaws may make it less likely that the Company\u2019s management wo uld be changed or that \nsomeone would acquire voting control of the Company without the  Board\u2019s consent.  These \nprovisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company even if an \nacquisition might be in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nPreferred Stock .  The Board can, at any time, under the Restated Certificate of  \nIncorporation and without stockholder approval, issue one or mo re new series of preferred stock.  \nIn some cases, the issuance of preferred stock without stockhol der approval could discourage or \nmake more difficult attempts to take control of the Company thr ough a merger, tender offer, \nproxy contest or otherwise.  Preferred stock with special votin g rights or other features issued to \npersons favoring the Company\u2019s management could stop a takeover  by preventing the person \ntrying to take control of the Company from acquiring enough vot ing shares necessary to take \ncontrol.  For a description of the outstanding series of the Co mpany\u2019s preferred stock as of \nDecember 31, 2022, see \u201cDescription of Preferred Stock\u201d below.\nAdvance Notice Requirements .  The Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with \nregard to stockholder proposals relating to nominations for the election of directors or other \nbusiness to be brought before meetings of the Company\u2019s stockholders.  These procedures \nprovide that notice of such stockholder proposals must be timel y given to the Company\u2019s \ncorporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken.  The notice must \ncontain certain information specified in the Bylaws and must ot herwise comply with the Bylaws.\nVacancies .  Under the Bylaws, a majority vote of the Board may increase or decrease the \nnumber of directors.  Any director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the \naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting pow er of the outstanding shares then \nentitled to vote at an election of directors.  Any vacancy on t he Board or newly created \ndirectorship will be filled by a majority vote of the remaining  directors then in office, and those \nnewly elected directors will serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders, \nand until such directors\u2019 successor has been elected and qualified.\nAmendment of Bylaws .  The Bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority \nof the Board, subject to certain limitations in the Bylaws.  The Company\u2019s stockholders also \nhave the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws. \n3", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3307, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd6091dd-3680-41ec-b412-0aeb790cea41": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd6091dd-3680-41ec-b412-0aeb790cea41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f17bdcf-572f-4a83-9342-7e8f7e8fb3da", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c8a0e7b63ba97bffcd89aa825496bc253bd94e8c2e96b9848e5f8617b963df4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd661e64-1d44-4f67-94dc-cb89f63ff438", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "228", "file_name": "BofA 2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4251282, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8597433226aa2317d63c1ce5796a25a9010be059fbb89fd778763f45252cd5a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "73e3273a-d669-4429-8041-1a0b73dbe0b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "73ca4f623aa1d8107508c4efb72c053a6fb7b1d1ad0e12bb7d1bb7a4cf074cea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4893e71efd1c280d772f8c543450d84aeadad50f0b5695f69d6e4f5a12a5e430", "text": "DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK\nThis section summarizes the general terms and provisions of all series of the Company\u2019s \npreferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022.

Each Trust XIV HITS has a liquidation amount of $1,000 and\nrepresents a beneficial interest in Trust XIV that corresponds to 1/100th of a share of Series G \nPreferred Stock.
