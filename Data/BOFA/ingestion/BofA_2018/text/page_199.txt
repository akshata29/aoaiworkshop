This Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the "Agreement") is made between Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Bank of America"), and you, a Non- Employee Director of Bank of America.  
  
Bank of America sponsors the Bank of America Corporation Key Employee Equity Plan (the "Stock Plan"). A prospectus describing the Stock Plan (the "Prospectus") is enclosed as Exhibit A. The Stock Plan itself is available upon request, and its terms and provisions are incorporated herein by reference. When used herein, the terms which are defined in the Stock Plan shall have the meanings given to them in the Stock Plan, as modified herein (if applicable).  
  
The award described in this Agreement (the "Award") is for the number of shares of Bank of America Common Stock shown above (the "Shares"). You and Bank of America mutually covenant and agree as follows:  
  
1\. The award of the Shares is subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan and this Agreement. You acknowledge having read the Prospectus and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan and this Agreement.  
  
2\. You agree that you shall comply with (or provide adequate assurance as to future compliance with) all applicable securities laws, as determined by Bank of America. You agree that, upon request, you will furnish a letter agreement providing that you will (i) not distribute or resell any of said Shares in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (ii) indemnify and hold Bank of America harmless against all liability for any such violation and (iii) accept all liability for any such violation.  
  
3\. The Shares shall become vested in accordance with Section 19.3 of the Stock Plan. Until they become vested, the Shares shall be held by Bank of America. Vested Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as administratively practicable following the applicable Non-Employee Director Vesting Date. In that regard, you agree that you shall comply with (or provide adequate assurance as to future compliance with) all applicable securities laws and income tax laws as determined by Bank of America as a condition precedent to the delivery of the Shares. While the Shares are held by Bank of America, you shall not have the right to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such Shares or any interest therein.  
  
4\. In accordance with Section 19.3 of the Stock Plan, you shall have the right to receive dividends on the Shares and to vote the Shares prior to vesting.  
  
5\. You acknowledge and agree that upon your cessation of services as a Non-Employee Director resulting in the forfeiture of any unvested Shares in accordance with paragraph 3 above, (i) your right to vote and to receive dividends on, and all other rights, title or interest in, to or with respect to, unvested Shares shall automatically, without further act, terminate and (ii) the unvested Shares shall be returned to Bank of America. You hereby irrevocably appoint (which appointment is coupled with an interest) Bank of America as your agent and attorney-in-fact to take any necessary or appropriate action to cause the Shares to be returned to Bank of America, including without limitation executing and delivering stock powers and instruments of transfer, making endorsements and/or making, initiating or issuing instructions or entitlement orders, all in your name and on your behalf. You hereby ratify and approve all acts done by Bank of America as such attorney-in-fact. Without limiting the foregoing, you expressly acknowledge and agree that any transfer agent for the Shares is fully authorized and protected in relying on, and shall incur no liability in acting on, any documents, instruments, endorsements, instructions, orders or communications from Bank of America in connection with the Shares or the transfer thereof, and that any such transfer agent is a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.  
  
6\. The existence of this award shall not affect in any way the right or power of Bank of America or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in Bank of America's capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of Bank of America, or any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference
