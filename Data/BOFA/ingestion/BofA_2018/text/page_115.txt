# Other Risk Management Derivatives  
  
Other risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures by economically hedging various assets and liabilities. The gains and losses on these derivatives are recognized in other income. The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for 2018, 2017 and 2016. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense that is recorded on the hedged item.  
  
  
## Gains and Losses on Other Risk Management Derivatives  
  
| (Dollars in millions) | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 |  
| - | - | - | - |  
| Interest rate risk on mortgage activities (1) | $ (107) | $ 8 | 461 |

(1) Primarily related to hedges of interest rate risk on MSRs and IRLCs to originate mortgage loans that will be held for sale. The net gains on IRLCs, which are not included in the table but are considered derivative instruments, were $47 million, $220 million and $533 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
  
(2) Primarily related to hedges of debt securities carried at fair value and hedges of foreign currency-denominated debt.  
  
  
# Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through Derivatives  
  
The Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had transferred $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed MBS to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion at the transfer dates. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of the transferred securities was $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion.  
  
  
# Sales and Trading Revenue  
  
The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation's policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation's Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items including trading account profits and net interest income as well as other revenue categories.  
  
Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the "Other" column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in trading account profits. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in trading account profits. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of  
  
the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in trading account profits as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in trading account profits. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.  
  
The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation's sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for 2018, 2017 and 2016. The difference between total trading account profits in the following table and in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents trading activities in business segments other than Global Markets. This table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses). Global Markets results in Note 23 - Business Segment Information are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. The table below is not presented on an FTE basis.

## Credit Derivatives  
  
The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.
