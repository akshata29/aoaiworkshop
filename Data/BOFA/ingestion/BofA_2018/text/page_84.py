# Summary of the TEXT EXTRACT:
# This text extract discusses various numerical data related to financial instruments, loan and lease losses, risk ratings, fair value measurements, and accrued income taxes and deferred tax assets. It provides hypothetical scenarios and sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of changes in key inputs on the allowance for loan and lease losses. The extract also mentions the classification of financial assets and liabilities based on the fair value hierarchy and the determination of fair value using pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies. Additionally, it discusses the estimation of accrued income taxes and net deferred tax assets, considering factors such as income tax laws, net operating loss, and tax credit carryforwards.

# Purpose of each variable:
# 1. var_cash_flow_impairment_12345678: Represents the potential impairment of the portfolio due to a one-percent decrease in expected cash flows.
# 2. var_loss_rates_increase_impairment_12345678: Represents the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses due to a one-percent increase in loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment and a one-percent decrease in expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment.
# 3. var_risk_ratings_downgrade_impairment_12345678: Represents the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses due to a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases.
# 4. var_allowance_ratio_12345678: Represents the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases.
# 5. var_fair_value_inputs_12345678: Represents the inputs used for valuation of financial instruments and MSRs, including market liquidity and credit quality.
# 6. var_level_3_assets_liabilities_12345678: Represents the financial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.
# 7. var_deferred_tax_assets_12345678: Represents the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future due to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities.
# 8. var_accurate_income_taxes_12345678: Represents the net amount of current income taxes expected to be paid or received from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to the operations.
