(1) For loans and securities, structured liabilities and net derivative assets, the weighted average is calculated based upon the absolute fair value of the instruments  
  
(2) The categories are aggregated based upon product type which differs from financial statement classification. The following is a reconciliation to the line items in the table on page53: Trading account assets - Corporate securities, trading loans and other of $1.9 billion, Trading account assets - Non-U.S. sovereign debt of$556 million, Trading account assets - Mortgage trading loans, ABS and other MBS of1.5 billion, AFS debt securities - Other taxable securities of $509 million, AFS debt securities - Tax- exempt securities of $469 million, Loans and leases of $571 million and LHFS of $690 million.  
  
(3) Includes models such as Monte Carlo simulation and Black- Scholes.  
  
(4) Includes models such as Monte Carlo simulation, Black-Scholes and other methods that model the joint dynamics of interest, inflation and foreign exchange  
  
rates  
  
(5) The weighted-average life is a product of changes in market rates of interest, prepayment rates and other model and cash flow assumptions.  
  
CPR = Constant Prepayment Rate  
  
CDR = Constant Default Rate  
  
MMBtu = Million British thermal units  
  
IR = Interest Rate  
  
FX = Foreign Exchange  
  
n/a = not applicable
