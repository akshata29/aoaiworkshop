(1) U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans.  
  
A commercial TDR is generally deemed to be in payment default when the loan is 90 days or more past due, including delinquencies that were not resolved as part of the modification. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows, along with observable market prices or fair value of collateral when measuring the allowance for loan and lease losses. TDRs that were in payment default had a carrying value of $150 million, $64 million and $140  
  
million for U.S. commercial and $3 million, $19 million and $34 million for commercial real estate at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
  
  
# Purchased Credit-impaired Loans  
  
The table below shows activity for the accretable yield on PCI loans, which includes the Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) portfolio and loans repurchased in connection with the 2013 settlement with FNMA. The amount of accretable yield is affected by changes in credit outlooks, including metrics such as default rates and loss severities, prepayment speeds, which can change the amount and period of time over which interest payments are expected to be received, and the interest rates on variable rate loans. The reclassifications from nonaccretable difference during 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to an increase in the expected principal and interest cash flows due to lower default estimates and the rising interest rate environment.
