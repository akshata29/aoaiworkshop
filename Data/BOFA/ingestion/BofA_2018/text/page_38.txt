# Client Balances  
  
Client balances managed under advisory and/or discretion of GWIM are AUM and are typically held in diversified portfolios. Fees earned on AUM are calculated as a percentage of clients' AUM balances. The asset management fees charged to clients per year depend on various factors, but are commonly driven by the breadth of the client's relationship. The net client AUM flows represent the net change in clients' AUM balances over a specified period  
  
of time, excluding market appreciation/depreciation and other adjustments. Client balances decreased $131.0 billion, or five percent, in 2018 to $2.6 trillion, primarily due to lower market valuations on AUM and brokerage balances, as measured at December 31, 2018, partially offset by positive flows.
