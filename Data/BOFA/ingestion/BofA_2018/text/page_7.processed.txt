# Privacy and Information Security  
  
We are subject to many U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect the non- public confidential information of our customers and employees. The Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act requires us to periodically disclose Bank of America's privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties, under certain circumstances. Other laws and regulations, at the international, federal and state level, impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers, including California's consumer privacy law that established basic rights of consumers in connection with their personal information. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also requires us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to provide the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the Data Protection Directive and related implementing national laws in its member states. The GDPR's impact on the Corporation was assessed and addressed through a comprehensive compliance implementation program. Additionally, other legislative and regulatory activity in the U.S. and abroad, as well as court proceedings and bilateral U.S. and EU political developments on the validity of cross-border data transfer mechanisms from the EU, continue to lend uncertainty to privacy compliance globally.  
  
  
# Item 1A. Risk Factors  
  
In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The discussion below addresses the most significant factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Additional factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition are discussed in Forward-looking Statements in the MD&A on page 20. However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face. For more information on how we manage risks, see Managing Risk in the MD&A on page 40.  
  
Any risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, capital position or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.  
  
  
## Market  
  
Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the U.S. and international financial markets, U.S. and non-U.S. fiscal and monetary policies and economic conditions generally.

Financial markets and general economic, political and social conditions in the U.S. and in one or more countries abroad, including the level and volatility of interest rates, unexpected changes in market financing conditions, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, consumer spending, employment levels, wage stagnation, prolonged federal government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, bankruptcies, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the global financial markets, the growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, terrorism, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure, investor sentiment and confidence, the sustainability of economic growth and any potential slowdown in economic activity may affect markets in the U.S. and abroad and our businesses. Any market downturn in the U.S. or abroad would likely result in a decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.  
  
In the U.S. and abroad, uncertainties surrounding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including potential further increases in its target funds rate and the ongoing reduction in its balance sheet, and other central banks are beyond our control and difficult to predict and can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) and impact our borrowers, potentially increasing delinquency and default rates as interest rates rise.  
  
Changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy and healthcare may adversely impact us. For example, significant fiscal policy initiatives may increase uncertainty surrounding the formulation and direction of U.S. monetary policy, and volatility of interest rates. Higher U.S. interest rates relative to other major economies could increase the likelihood of a more volatile and appreciating U.S. dollar. Changes, or proposed changes to certain U.S. trade policies, particularly with important trading partners, including China, could upset financial markets, disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation through the use of tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury Bonds.  
  
Any of these developments could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses, our securities and derivatives portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels and liquidity and the costs of running our business, and our results of operations. Additionally, events and ongoing uncertainty related to the planned exit of the U.K. from the EU could magnify any negative impact of these developments on our business and results of operations.  
  
Increased market volatility and adverse changes in other financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk.  
  
Our liquidity, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates, fluctuations in equity and futures prices, lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products, the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and business factors. These market risks may adversely affect, among other things, (i) the value of our on- and off-balance sheet securities, trading assets, other financial instruments and MSRs, (ii) the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets, (iii) the value of assets under management (AUM), (iv) fee income relating to AUM, (v) customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives, (vi)
