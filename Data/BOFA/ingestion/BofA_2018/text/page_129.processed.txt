### Credit Card and Other Consumer  
  
Impaired loans within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment consist entirely of loans that have been modified in TDRs. The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal and local laws and guidelines. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the customer's available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for  
  
borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers' entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge. For more information on the regulatory guidance on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.
