The capital adequacy rules issued by the U.S. banking regulators require institutions to meet the established minimums outlined in the table above. Failure to meet the minimum requirements can lead to certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's financial position. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates were "well capitalized."

For additional information, see Note 10 - Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash. In  
  
addition, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had cash deposited with clearing organizations of $8.1 billion and $11.9 billion primarily recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
  
  
# Bank Subsidiary Distributions  
  
The primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the Corporation to its shareholders are capital distributions received from its bank subsidiaries, BANA and Bank of America California, N.A. In 2018, the Corporation received dividends of $26.1 billion from BANA and $320 million from Bank of America California, N.A. In addition, Bank of America California, N.A. returned capital of $1.4 billion to the Corporation in 2018.  
  
The amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without OCC approval is the subsidiary bank's net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the period. In 2019, BANA can declare and pay dividends of approximately$3.1 billion to the Corporation plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2019 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. Bank of America California, N.A. can pay dividends of $40 million in 2019 plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2019 up to the date of any such dividend declaration.
