# Investment VIEs  
  
The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation's consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $270 million and $249 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $37.7 billion and $20.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $7.2 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.  
  
  
# Leveraged Lease Trusts  
  
The Corporation's net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The trusts hold long- lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation's maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.  
  
  
# Tax Credit VIEs  
  
The Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $17.0 billion and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Corporation's risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.  
  
The Corporation's investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $8.9 billion and $8.0 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of$3.8 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $981 million, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion and reported pretax losses in other income of $798 million, $766 million and $789 million, respectively. Tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation's annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. Accordingly, the portion of a year's expected tax benefits recognized in any given quarter may differ from 25 percent. The Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.
