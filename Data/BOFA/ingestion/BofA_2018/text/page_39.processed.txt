Net income for Global Banking increased $1.2 billion to $8.2 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by lower income tax expense from the reduction in the federal income tax rate and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower revenue. Noninterest expense was relatively unchanged.  
  
Revenue decreased $355 million to $19.6 billion driven by lower noninterest income, partially offset by higher net interest income.
