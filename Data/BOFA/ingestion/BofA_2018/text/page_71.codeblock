# Summary of the TEXT EXTRACT:
# Table 43 presents the top 20 non-U.S. countries exposure, including funded loans and loan equivalents, unfunded loan commitments, net counterparty exposure, securities/other investments, country exposure at December 31, 2018, hedges and credit default protection, net country exposure at December 31, 2018, and the increase (decrease) from December 31, 2017.
# The largest emerging market country exposure at December 31, 2018 was China, with a net exposure of $14.6 billion, concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations, and commercial banks.
# The largest EU country exposure at December 31, 2018 was the U.K. with a net exposure of $54.9 billion, a $17.3 billion increase from December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by corporate loan growth and increased placements with the central bank as part of liquidity management.
# Table 44 presents countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of total assets. At December 31, 2018, the U.K. and France were the only countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of total assets. Germany and China had total cross-border exposure of $20.4 billion and $19.5 billion, representing 0.87 percent and 0.83 percent of total assets, respectively.
