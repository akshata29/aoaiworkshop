GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust).  
  
MLGWM's advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets. MLGWM providestailored solutions to meet clients' needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products.  
  
U.S. Trust, together with MLGWM's Private Banking & Investments Group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients' wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.  
  
Net income for GWIM increased $986 million to $4.1 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher revenue and lower income tax expense from the reduction in the federal income tax rate, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. The operating margin was 28 percent compared to 27 percent a year ago.  
  
Net interest income increased $121 million to $6.3 billion due to higher deposit spreads and average loan balances, partially offset by lower loan spreads and average deposit balances.  
  
Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $627 million to $13.0 billion. The increase was driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing.  
  
Noninterest expense increased $221 million to $13.8 billion primarily due to higher revenue-related incentive expense and investments for business growth, partially offset by continued expense discipline.  
  
The return on average allocated capital was28 percent, up from 22 percent, as higher net income was partially offset by an increased capital allocation. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 30.  
  
Revenue from MLGWM of $15.9 billion and revenue from U.S. Trust of $3.4 billion both increased four percent due to higher asset management fees driven by higher net flows and market valuations, and an increase in net interest income. The increase in MLGWM revenue was partially offset by lower AUM pricing and transactional revenue.
