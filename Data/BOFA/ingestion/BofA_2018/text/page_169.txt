(1) For loans and securities, structured liabilities and net derivative assets, the weighted average is calculated based upon the absolute fair value of the  
  
instruments.  
  
(2) The categories are aggregated based upon product type which differs from financial statement classification. The following is a reconciliation to the line items in the table on page52: Trading account assets - Corporate securities, trading loans and other of $1.6 billion, Trading account assets - Non-U.S. sovereign debt of$465 million, Trading account assets - Mortgage trading loans, ABS and other MBS of1.6 billion, AFS debt securities of $606 million, Other debt securities carried at fair value - Non-agency residential of $172 million, Other assets, including MSRs, of$2.9 billion, Loans and leases of $338 million and LHFS of $542 million.  
  
(3) Includes models such as Monte Carlo simulation and Black- Scholes.  
  
(4) Includes models such as Monte Carlo simulation, Black-Scholes and other methods that model the joint dynamics of interest, inflation and foreign exchange  
  
rates  
  
(5) The weighted-average life is a product of changes in market rates of interest, prepayment rates and other model and cash flow assumptions.  
  
CPR = Constant Prepayment Rate CDR = Constant Default Rate  
  
MMBtu = Million British thermal units  
  
IR = Interest Rate  
  
FX = Foreign Exchange  
  
n/a = not applicable
