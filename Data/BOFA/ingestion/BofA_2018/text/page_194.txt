Eligibility. Each Nonemployee Director shall be eligible to participate in the Plan as of the date he or she is appointed as a Nonemployee Director. (a)  
  
(b) Elections to Defer. A Nonemployee Director may become a Participant in the Plan for a Plan Year by irrevocably electing, on a form provided by the Plan Administrator, to defer all or any portion of any Cash Compensation and/or any Stock Compensation payable during the Plan Year. In order to be effective, a Nonemployee Director's election to defer must be executed and returned to the Plan Administrator on or before the date specified by the Plan Administrator for such purpose. Such election must be made prior to the beginning of the Plan Year to which the election relates; provided, however, that an individual who first becomes a Nonemployee Director after the start of a Plan Year may make such deferral election no later than the date before such individual is appointed as a Nonemployee Director.

# Establishment of Accounts.  
  
(i) The Corporation shall establish and maintain on its books a Cash Account and a Stock Account for each Participant. Each Account shall be designated by the name of the Participant for whom established.  
  
(ii) Any Cash Compensation deferred by a Participant shall be credited to the Participant's Cash Account or Stock Account as the Participant shall elect. The election shall be made at the time determined by the Plan Administrator and on the form provided by the Plan Administrator. A separate election directing deferral to the Cash Account or Stock Account shall be permitted with respect to each separate component of Cash Compensation being deferred. If no election is made, any Cash Compensation deferred shall be credited to the Participant's Cash Account. To the extent any Cash Compensation is to be credited to a Participant's Stock Account, such amounts shall be credited to the Stock Account as of the date the amounts would have otherwise been paid to the Participant with the number of Stock Units equal to the dollar amount of the deferral divided by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on such date.  
  
(iii) Any Stock Compensation deferred by a Participant shall be credited to the Participant's Stock Account in a number of "Stock Units" equal to the corresponding number of shares of Common Stock subject to the agreement and/or plan pursuant to which such Stock Compensation was awarded to the Participant (including any fractional shares). The Stock Units shall be credited to the Participant's Stock Account as of the date the shares would have otherwise been awarded under the agreement and/or plan pursuant to which such Stock Compensation was awarded to the Participant.
