## U.S. Credit Card  
  
At December 31, 2018, 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM. Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio increased $2.1 billion in 2018 to $98.3 billion due to higher retail volume partially offset by payments as well as the sale of a small portfolio. In 2018, net charge-offs increased $324 million to $2.8 billion, and U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $142 million and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $94 million, each driven by portfolio seasoning and loan growth.  
  
Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $334.8 billion and $326.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The increase was driven by account growth and lines of credit increases.
