(or attorney-in-fact in the case of an incompetent) as the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, may decide, and the Plan Administrator shall not be liable to any person for any such decision or any payment pursuant thereto.  
  
(g) Withdrawals on Account of an Unforeseeable Emergency. A Participant who is in active service with the Corporation may, in the Plan Administrator's sole discretion, receive a payment of all or any part of the amounts previously credited to the Participant's Cash Account (but not Stock Account) in the case of an "unforeseeable emergency." A Participant requesting a payment pursuant to this subparagraph (g) shall have the burden of proof of establishing, to the Plan Administrator's satisfaction, the existence of such "unforeseeable emergency," and the amount of the payment needed to satisfy the same. In that regard, the Participant shall provide the Plan Administrator with such financial data and information as the Plan Administrator may request. If the Plan Administrator determines that a payment should be made to a Participant under this subparagraph (g), such payment shall be made within a reasonable time after the Plan Administrator's determination of the existence of such "unforeseeable emergency" and the amount of payment so needed. As used herein, the term "unforeseeable emergency" means a severe financial hardship to a Participant resulting from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the Participant or of a dependent of the Participant, loss of the Participant's property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. The circumstances that shall constitute an "unforeseeable emergency" shall depend upon the facts of each case, but, in any case, payment may not be made to the extent that such hardship is or may be relieved (i) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, or (ii) by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship. Examples of what are not considered to be "unforeseeable emergencies" include the need to send a Participant's child to college or the desire to purchase a home. Withdrawals of amounts because of an "unforeseeable emergency" shall not exceed an amount reasonably needed to satisfy the emergency need.  
  
(h) Vesting of Stock Units. For Stock Units credited to a Participant's Account related to a deferral of Stock Compensation under paragraph 5(c)(iii) above, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 5(I), such Stock Units shall not become vested until the related "vesting date" under the agreement and/or plan pursuant to which such Stock Compensation was awarded to Participant. If the Participant ceases to serve as a Nonemployee Director before the vesting date due to the Nonemployee Director's death, or if there is a "change in control" (as defined under the agreement and/or plan pursuant to which such Stock Compensation was awarded to the Participant) prior to the vesting date, then the Stock Units shall become fully vested as of the date of such death or change in control, as applicable. If the Nonemployee Director ceases to serve as a Nonemployee Director at any time for any reason other than death before the earlier of the vesting date or a change in control, then the Stock Units will become vested pro rata to the same extent they would have become vested under the provisions of the agreement and/or plan pursuant to which such Stock Compensation was awarded to the Participant, and to the extent the Stock Units are not thereby vested they shall be forfeited as of the date of such cessation of services.  
  
  
# 6\. Amendment, Modification and Termination of the Plan:  
  
The Compensation Committee shall have the right and power at any time and from time to time to amend the Plan in whole or in part and at any time to terminate the Plan; provided, however, that no such amendment or termination shall reduce the amount actually credited to a Participant's Accounts under the Plan on the date of such amendment or termination, or further defer the due dates for the payment of such amounts, with the consent of the affected Participant. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, but only to the extent permitted by Code Section 409A, in connection with any termination of the Plan the Compensation Committee shall have the authority to cause the Accounts of all Participants to be paid in a single cash payment as of a date determined by the Compensation Committee or to otherwise accelerate the payment of Accounts in such manner as the Compensation Committee shall determine in its discretion.  
  
  
# 7\. Claims Procedures:  
  
(a) General. In the event that a Claimant has a Claim under the Plan, such Claim shall be made by the Claimant's filing a notice thereof with the Plan Administrator within ninety (90) days after such Claimant first has knowledge of such Claim. Each Claimant who has submitted a Claim to the Plan Administrator shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to state such Claimant's position and to present evidence and other material relevant to the Claim to the Plan Administrator for its consideration in rendering its decision with respect thereto.

A copy of such written decision shall be furnished to the Claimant.
