Government Supervision and Regulation \nThe following discussion describes, among other things, elements of an extensive \nregulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies, banks and \nbroker-dealers, including specific information about Bank of America. \nWe are subject to an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, \nfinancial holding companies and banks and other financial services entities. U.S. \nfederal regulation of banks, BHCs and financial holding companies is intended \nprimarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) \nrather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. \nAs a registered financial holding company and BHC, the Corporation is subject \nto the supervision of, and regular inspection by, the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank subsidiaries (the \nBanks) organized as national banking associations are subject to regulation, \nsupervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \n(OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. \nU.S. financial holding companies, and the companies under their control, are \npermitted to engage in activities considered \u201cfinancial in nature\u201d as defined by the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve interpretations. Unless \notherwise limited by the Federal Reserve, a financial holding company may engage \ndirectly or indirectly in activities considered financial in nature provided the financial \nholding company gives the Federal Reserve after-the-fact notice of the new \nactivities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also permits national banks to engage in \nactivities considered financial in nature through a financial subsidiary, subject to \ncertain conditions and limitations and with the approval of the OCC. \nThe scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to \nwhich we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial \ncrisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. In \naddition, the banking and financial services sector is subject to substantial \nregulatory enforcement and fines. Many of these changes have occurred as a result \nof the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \nFinancial Reform Act).

Similarly, under the cross-guarantee \nprovisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 \n(FDICIA), in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC, either as a \nresult of default of a bank subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such \na subsidiary in danger of default, the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be \nassessed for the FDIC\u2019s loss, subject to certain exceptions. \nTransactions with Affiliates \nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by \nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W, the Banks are subject to restrictions that limit \ncertain types of transactions between the Banks and their nonbank affiliates. In \ngeneral, U.S. banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions \nof credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving its nonbank \naffiliates. Additionally, transactions between U.S. banks and their nonbank affiliates \nare required to be on arm\u2019s length terms and must be consistent with standards of \nsafety and soundness. \nDeposit Insurance \nDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits \nand conditions of applicable law and the FDIC\u2019s regulations. Pursuant to the \nFinancial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits are $250,000 per customer. \nAll insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in \norder to fund the DIF. \nThe FDIC is required to maintain at least a designated minimum ratio of the DIF \nto insured deposits in the U.S. The Financial Reform Act requires the FDIC to \nassess insured depository institutions to achieve a DIF ratio of at least 1.35 percent \nby September 30, 2020. In November 2018, the FDIC announced that the DIF ratio \nexceeded 1.35 in advance of the deadline and that the related surcharges ceased. \nAdditionally, the FDIC adopted regulations that establish a long-term target DIF \nratio of greater than two percent. As of the date of this report, the DIF ratio is below \nthis required target and the FDIC has adopted a restoration plan that may result in \nincreased deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessment rates are \nsubject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the \nstability of the banking industry as a whole.

For \ninstance, Federal Reserve regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a capital \nplan as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). \nThe purpose of the CCAR for the Federal Reserve is to assess the capital planning \nprocess of the BHC, including any planned capital actions, such as payment of \ndividends and common stock repurchases. \nOur ability to pay dividends is also affected by the various minimum capital \nrequirements and the capital and non-capital standards established under the \nFDICIA. The right of the Corporation, our shareholders and our creditors to \nparticipate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries is further \nsubject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries. \nIf the Federal Reserve finds that any of our Banks are not \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d or \n\u201cwell-managed,\u201d we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal \nReserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements, which \nmay contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. \nAdditionally, the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, \nunder certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or BHC, that \nthe payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit \npayment thereof. \nFor more information regarding the requirements relating to the payment of \ndividends, including the minimum capital requirements, see Note 13 \u2013 \nShareholders\u2019 Equity and Note 16 \u2013 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to \nthe Consolidated Financial Statements. \nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are \nsubject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to \nblock or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or \nother subsidiaries. \nResolution Planning \nAs a BHC with greater than $50 billion of assets, the Corporation is required by the \nFederal Reserve and the FDIC to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly \nresolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. \nSuch resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly \nresolution of the BHC and its material entities pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \nand other applicable resolution regimes under one or more hypothetical scenarios \nassuming no extraordinary government assistance. \nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that the BHC\u2019s plan is not \ncredible, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose more stringent \ncapital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or \noperations.

In \naddition, under the Financial Reform Act, when a systemically important financial \ninstitution (SIFI) such as the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC \nmay be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such \ninstitution. In the event of such appointment, the FDIC could, among other things, \ninvoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the \nSecretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk \ndeterminations. The orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Act, but also adopts certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy \nCode. \nThe orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the U.S. \nBankruptcy Code. For example, in certain circumstances, the FDIC could permit \npayment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant (e.g., short-term \ncreditors or operating creditors) in lieu of paying other obligations (e.g., long-term \ncreditors) without the need to obtain creditors\u2019 consent or prior court review. The \ninsolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total \nelimination of the value of a BHC\u2019s outstanding equity, as well as impairment or \nelimination of certain debt. \nUnder the FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC \ncould replace a distressed BHC with a bridge holding company, which could \ncontinue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but \nwhose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original BHC. \nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve requires that BHCs maintain minimum levels \nof long-term debt required to provide adequate loss absorbing capacity in the event \nof a resolution. \nFor more information regarding our resolution, seeItem 1A.

These \noperations are subject to regulation under the Financial Reform Act, the European \nUnion (EU) Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation, the \nEuropean Market Infrastructure Regulation and similar regulatory regimes in other \njurisdictions, that regulate or will regulate the derivatives markets in which we \noperate by, among other things: requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain \nderivatives; imposing new capital, margin, reporting, registration and business \nconduct requirements for certain market participants; imposing position limits on \ncertain over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives; and imposing derivatives trading \ntransparency requirements. Regulations of derivatives are already in effect in many \nmarkets in which we operate. \nIn addition, many G-20 jurisdictions, including the U.S., U.K., Germany and \nJapan, have adopted resolution stay regulations to address concerns that the close -\nout of derivatives and other financial contracts in resolution could impede orderly \nresolution of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), and additional \njurisdictions are expected to follow suit. We and 24 other G-SIBs have adhered to a \nprotocol amending certain financial contracts to provide for contractual recognition \nof stays of termination rights under various statutory resolution regimes and a stay \non the exercise of cross-default rights based on an affiliate\u2019s entry into U.S. \nbankruptcy proceedings. As resolution stay regulations of a particular jurisdiction go \ninto effect, we amend financial contracts in compliance with such regulations. \nConsumer Regulations \nOur consumer businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by \nfederal and state regulators.

For example, the value \nof certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. If the \nFederal Reserve or a non-U.S. central bank changes or signals a change in \nmonetary policy, market interest rates could be affected, which could adversely \nimpact the value of such assets. In addition, the low but rising interest rate \nenvironment and recent flattening of the yield curve could negatively impact our \nliquidity, financial condition or results of operations, including future revenue and \nearnings growth. \nWe use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk \nexposures but those are subject to inherent limitations. For more information \nregarding models and strategies, see Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 Other on page 16. In \ntimes of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated \nindicators may become correlated and vice versa. These types of market \nmovements may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to \nincur significant losses. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated where \nother market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or \nalgorithms similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our \nrisk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market \ndislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly \nor no market exists for certain assets. To the extent that we own securities that do \nnot have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions \non sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore \nreduce our risk associated with such positions. In addition, challenging market \nconditions may also adversely affect our investment banking fees. \nFor more information about market risk and our market risk management \npolicies and procedures, see Market Risk Management in the MD&A on page 70. \nWe may incur losses if the value of certain assets declines, including due \nto changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. \nWe have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including certain loans and \nloan commitments, loans held-for-sale, securities financing agreements, asset-\nbacked secured financings, long-term deposits, long-term debt, trading account \nassets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale (AFS) debt \nand marketable equity securities, other debt securities, equity method investments, \ncertain MSRs and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value \nand other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments. We determine \nthese values based on applicable accounting guidance, which for financial \ninstruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price \nand to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \ninputs in fair value measurements. The fair values of these financial instruments \ninclude adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality, funding impact on certain \nderivatives and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate. \nGains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of \noperations, including higher or lower mortgage banking income and earnings, \nunless we have effectively hedged our exposures. For example, decreases in \ninterest rates and increases in mortgage prepayment speeds, which are influenced \nby interest rates and other factors such as reductions in mortgage insurance \npremiums and origination costs, could adversely impact the value of our MSR \nasset, and cause a significant acceleration of purchase premium amortization on \nour mortgage portfolio, because a decline in long-term interest rates shortens the \nexpected lives of the securities, and adversely affects our net interest margin. Conversely, increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in \nresidential mortgage loan originations. In addition, increases in interest rates may \nadversely impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt \nsecurities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated other \ncomprehensive income and, thus, capital levels. \nFair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the \nprices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability \nof these transactions.", "start_char_idx": 1212, "end_char_idx": 5873, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b3778ac-72ec-4342-8beb-28c2b17d866a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b3778ac-72ec-4342-8beb-28c2b17d866a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83b386cf-2110-4f4e-b060-bea418fbc083", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "29da327281b9240344ebd120fd7366ec607a451b28b39a06b4bd19d311186c3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fdda8378-ad03-4ad9-891a-a0a45fe80b3f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "8268b5bc848c6de2a0322f9e4701fc4abae821b312146a106c9e485e8839baf5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0625c994-2830-42f4-8d2b-432a29f65ee7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "94108a0ab3930817fa2da808426859c688020988de99033d7d2bace236e8ce9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fa1f05b2e35926cd53e676b7808f38c590de16ca2b15d553f48f3936fe8e64af", "text": "For example, decreases in \ninterest rates and increases in mortgage prepayment speeds, which are influenced \nby interest rates and other factors such as reductions in mortgage insurance \npremiums and origination costs, could adversely impact the value of our MSR \nasset, and cause a significant acceleration of purchase premium amortization on \nour mortgage portfolio, because a decline in long-term interest rates shortens the \nexpected lives of the securities, and adversely affects our net interest margin.

We fund our assets primarily with \nglobally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured \nliabilities transacted in the capital markets. We rely on certain secured funding \nsources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive in \nnature. We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer lending activities. \nOur liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital \nmarkets; illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets; the decrease in value of \neligible collateral or increased collateral requirements due to credit concerns for \nshort-term borrowing; changes to our relationships with our funding providers \nbased on real or perceived changes in our risk profile; prolonged federal \ngovernment shutdowns; changes in regulations, guidance or GSE status that \nimpact our funding avenues or ability to access certain funding sources; the refusal \nor inability of the Federal Reserve to act as lender of last resort; simultaneous draws \non lines of credit; the withdrawal of customer deposits, which could result from \ncustomer attrition for higher yields or the desire for more conservative alternatives; \nincreased regulatory liquidity, capital and margin requirements for our U.S. or \ninternational banks and their nonbank subsidiaries; failure by a significant market \nparticipant or third party, such as a clearing agent or custodian; reputational issues; \nor negative perceptions about our short- or long-term business prospects, including \ndowngrades of our credit ratings.

Credit spreads are the amount in excess of the interest \nrate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of a similar maturity \nthat we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our \ncredit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in mark-to-market or \ncredit valuation adjustment exposures.

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by \nrating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, \nincluding long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and asset \nsecuritizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies, \nwhich consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, \nperformance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control \nsuch as the likelihood of the U.S. government providing meaningful support to us or \nour subsidiaries in a crisis. \nRating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time, and \nthere can be no assurance as to when and whether downgrades will occur.

We evaluate and manage \nliquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as \nthere are legal, regulatory, contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize \nliquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, \nincluding the parent company, which could result in adverse liquidity events. The \nparent company depends on dividends, distributions, loans, advances and other \npayments from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on \nour common stock and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other \nobligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank \nand broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, \nor authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those \nsubsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. Our bank and broker-\ndealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with \naffiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well as \nrestrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage \naccounts to fund their businesses.

In the current plan, Bank of America Corporation\u2019s preferred resolution \nstrategy is a \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy. This strategy provides that only the \nparent holding company files for resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and \ncontemplates providing certain key operating subsidiaries with sufficient capital and \nliquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to \ncontinue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of \nthe parent holding company. Bank of America Corporation has entered into \nintercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and \nliquidity to key subsidiaries. Pursuant to these arrangements, if Bank of America \nCorporation\u2019s liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes \nimminent, Bank of America Corporation will no longer be able to draw liquidity from \nits key subsidiaries, and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets \nto a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, which could materially and \nadversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to pay dividends \nto shareholders and meet our payment obligations. \nIn addition, if the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly determine that Bank of \nAmerica Corporation\u2019s resolution plan is not credible, they could impose more \nstringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, \nactivities or operations. Further, we could be required to take certain actions that \ncould impose operating costs and could potentially result in the divestiture or \nrestructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries. \nUnder the Financial Reform Act, when a G-SIB such as Bank of America \nCorporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver \nin order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution. In the event of such \nappointment, the FDIC could, among other things, invoke the orderly liquidation \nauthority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury \nmakes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. In 2013, the FDIC \nissued a notice describing its preferred \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy for resolving a \nG-SIB. Under this approach, the FDIC could replace Bank of America Corporation \nwith a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an \norderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity would be held solely for \nthe benefit of our creditors. The FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy may result in \nour security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under \na bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy. \nFor more information about resolution planning, seeItem 1.

Specifically, \nour consumer portfolio could be negatively impacted by drastic reductions in \nemployment, or increases in underemployment, resulting in lower disposable \nincome. \nWe estimate and establish an allowance for credit losses for losses inherent in \nour lending activities (including unfunded lending commitments), excluding those \nmeasured at fair value, through a charge to earnings. The process for determining \nthe amount of the allowance requires us to make difficult and complex judgments, \nincluding loss forecasts on how borrowers will react to changing economic \nconditions. The ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations \nwill likely be impacted by changes in future economic conditions, which in turn \ncould impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates. There is \nalso the possibility that we will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic \nindicators or that we will fail to accurately estimate their impacts. \nWe may suffer unexpected losses if the models and assumptions we use to \nestablish reserves and make judgments in extending credit to our borrowers or \ncounterparties prove inaccurate in predicting future events. In addition, external \nfactors, such as natural disasters, can influence recognition of credit losses in our \nportfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses. Although we believe that our \nallowance for credit losses was in compliance with applicable accounting standards \na t December 31, 2018, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address \ncredit losses, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate. In such an event, we \nmay increase the size of our allowance which would reduce our earnings. \nIn the ordinary course of our business, we also may be subject to a \nconcentration of credit risk in a particular industry, geographic location, \ncounterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in the financial condition or \nprospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any \nparticular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses, and the \nprocesses by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to \nindividual entities, industries and countries may not function as we have anticipated. \nWhile our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties, we \nroutinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial \nservices industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, \ninsurers, mutual funds and hedge funds, and other institutional clients.

Financial services institutions and other \ncounterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other \nrelationships. As a result, defaults by, or even market uncertainty about the financial \nstability of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services \nindustry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity disruptions, losses and \ndefaults. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk and, in some cases, \ndisputes and litigation in the event of default of a counterparty. In addition, our credit \nrisk may be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be \nliquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the \nloan or derivatives exposure due to us. Further, disputes with obligors as to the \nvaluation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility \nor illiquidity, and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to \nrealize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral. \nIn the ordinary course of business, we also enter into transactions with \nsovereign nations, U.S. states and U.S. municipalities.

Significant political and economic \nuncertainty persists regarding the timing, details and viability of each phase. There \nmay be heightened uncertainty if the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU are not \nagreed upon at the time of its exit. The ultimate impact and terms of the U.K.\u2019s \nplanned exit remain unclear, and short- and long-term global economic and market \nvolatility may occur, including as a result of currency fluctuations and trade \nrelations. If uncertainty resulting from the U.K.\u2019s exit negatively impacts economic \nconditions, financial markets and consumer confidence, our business, results of \noperations, financial position and/or operational model could be adversely affected. \nWe are also subject to different laws, regulations and regulatory authorities and \nmay incur additional costs and/or experience negative tax consequences as a result \nof establishing our principal EU banking and broker-dealer operations outside of the \nU.K., which could adversely impact our EU business, results of operations and \noperational model. Additionally, changes to the legal and regulatory framework \nunder which our subsidiaries will continue to provide products and services in the \nU.K. following an exit by the U.K. from the EU may result in additional compliance \ncosts and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. For more \ninformation on our EU operations outside of the U.K., see Executive Summary \u2013 \nRecent Developments \u2013 U.K. Exit from the EU in the MD&A on page 21. \nBusiness Operations \nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, \nor those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, and adversely impact \nour results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause \nlegal or reputational harm. \nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization \nand, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited \nto our own internal operational functions.

For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the \nfuture as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based \nproduct offerings, expand our internal usage of web- or cloud-based products and \napplications and continue to develop our use of process automation and artificial \nintelligence. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent \nyears in part due to the increasingly sophisticated activities of organized crime \ngroups, hackers, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled \nemployees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved \nin corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may \nbe vulnerable to compromise. Internal access management failures could result in \nthe compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data. Targeted social \nengineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to \nprevent. The techniques used by bad actors change frequently and may not be \nrecognized until well after a breach has occurred, at which time the materiality of the \nbreach may be difficult to assess. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or \nsecurity breaches at third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not \nbe disclosed to us in a timely manner. \nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material \nconsequences relating to technology failure, cyber-attacks or other information or \nsecurity breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, there can be no \nassurance that we will not suffer such material losses or consequences in the \nfuture.

Future \nrepresentations and warranties losses may occur in excess of our recorded liability \nand estimated RPL, and such losses could have a material adverse effect on our \nliquidity, financial condition and results of operations. \nAdditionally, our recorded liability for representations and warranties exposures \nand the corresponding estimated RPL do not consider certain losses related to \nservicing, including foreclosure and related costs, fraud, indemnity or claims \n(including for residential mortgage-backed securities) related to securities law. \nLosses with respect to one or more of these matters could be material to our results \nof operations or liquidity. \nFor more information about our representations and warranties exposure, see \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations \u2013 Representations \nand Warranties in the MD&A on page 40, Complex Accounting Estimates \u2013 \nRepresentations and Warranties Liability in the MD&A on page 79 and Note 12 \u2013 \nCommitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nFailure to satisfy our obligations as servicer for residential mortgage \nsecuritizations, along with other losses we could incur in our capacity as \nservicer, and foreclosure delays and/or investigations into our residential \nmortgage foreclosure practices could cause losses. \nWe and our legacy companies have securitized a significant portion of the \nresidential mortgage loans that we originated or acquired. We service a portion of \nthe loans we have securitized and also service loans on behalf of third-party \nsecuritization vehicles and other investors. If we commit a material breach of our \nobligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the \nbreach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, which could \ncause us to lose servicing income. In addition, for loans principally held in private-\nlabel securitization trusts, we may have liability for any failure by us, as a servicer or \nmaster servicer, for any act or omission on our part that involves willful \nmisfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties. If any \nsuch breach was found to have occurred, it may harm our reputation, increase our \nservicing costs or adversely impact our results of operations. Additionally, with \nrespect to foreclosures, we may incur costs or losses due to irregularities in the \nunderlying documentation, or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a \nborrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the \nforeclosure process. We may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged \ndeficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing \nforeclosure. \nChanges in the structure of the GSEs and the relationship among the \nGSEs, the government and the private markets, or the conversion of the \ncurrent conservatorship of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac into receivership, \ncould result in significant changes to our business operations and may \nadversely impact our business. \nDuring 2018, we sold approximately $3.0 billion of loans to Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. Each is currently in a conservatorship with its primary regulator, the \nFederal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), acting as conservator. We cannot predict \nwhether the conservatorships will end, any associated changes to their business \nstructure that could result or whether the conservatorships will end in receivership, \nprivatization or other \nBank of America 2018 12", "start_char_idx": 5021, "end_char_idx": 9279, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92f6de32-96cb-44fa-a892-2788dc8fa86f": {"__data__": {"id_": "92f6de32-96cb-44fa-a892-2788dc8fa86f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5118a6b2-523c-4a17-9b5e-d280bf22909b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4d8f150c661a234f4d7a0a1cc18720cf070d80b77c1190c16582e5b582b53d96", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c00f9a91-c06a-402f-9b0f-6bc11e8718d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c17d0334f17fa122ba831c1d83cd09efea5c97700fda4c62aa74ce9b8727f536", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b780531-b878-4cac-a135-e94797ad6539", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "80c68ebdabd5b24d9b9d97b6a4453b4bfee866c5a575ed3473a05ffef18a85f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6628caafef64bb8508c0857d8756c2648f5a7f01aaee023966c5b94f9d18b8e8", "text": "change in business structure. There are several proposed approaches to reform \nthat, if enacted, could change the structure and the relationship among the GSEs, \nthe government and the private markets, including the trading markets for agency \nconforming mortgage loans and markets for mortgage-related securities in which \nwe participate. Although the FHFA has taken steps to unify underwriting \nparameters and business practices between GSEs, we cannot predict the prospects \nfor the enactment, timing or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding \nthe future status of any GSEs and/or their impact on the guarantees, demand or \nprice of mortgage-related securities. Accordingly, uncertainty regarding their future \ncontinues to exist, including whether the GSEs will continue to exist in their current \nforms or continue to guarantee mortgages and provide funding for mortgage loans. \nAny of these developments could adversely affect the value of our securities \nportfolios, capital levels and liquidity and results of operations. \nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk \nand reducing the potential for losses. \nOur risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We \nseek to effectively identify, measure, monitor, report and control the types of risk to \nwhich we are subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, \noperational and reputational risks. While we employ a broad and diversified set of \ncontrols and risk mitigation techniques, including hedging strategies and techniques \nthat seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to \npotential losses, our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is \ninherently limited by our ability to identify all risks, including emerging and unknown \nrisks, anticipate the timing of risks, apply effective hedging strategies, manage and \naggregate data correctly and efficiently, and develop risk management models to \nassess and control risk. \nOur ability to manage risk is limited by our ability to develop and maintain a \nculture of managing risk well throughout the Corporation and manage risks \nassociated with third parties and vendors, to enable effective risk management and \nensure that risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a \ntimely manner. Uncertain economic conditions, heightened legislative and \nregulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry and the overall complexity of \nour operations, among other developments, may result in a heightened level of risk \nfor us.

We continue to \nexperience a significant volume of litigation and other disputes, including claims for \ncontractual indemnification with counterparties regarding relative rights and \nresponsibilities. Consumers, clients and other counterparties continue to be \nlitigious. Among other things, financial institutions, including us, continue to be the \nsubject of claims alleging anti-competitive conduct with respect to various products \nand markets, including U.S. antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability \nfor treble damages. In addition, regulatory authorities have had a supervisory focus \non enforcement, including in connection with alleged violations of law and customer \nharm. For example, U.S. regulators and government agencies have pursued claims \nagainst financial institutions under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and \nEnforcement Act, False Claims Act and antitrust laws. Such claims may carry \nsignificant and, in certain cases, treble damages. The ongoing environment of \nextensive regulation, regulatory compliance burdens, litigation and regulatory and \ngovernment enforcement, combined with uncertainty related to the continually \nevolving regulatory environment, may affect operational and compliance costs and \nrisks, which may limit our ability to continue providing certain products and services. \nAdditionally, misconduct by employees, including improper or illegal conduct, \ncan cause significant reputational harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. \nFor more information on litigation risks, seeNote 12 \u2013 Commitments and \nContingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nU.S. federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory \ncapital, TLAC, long-term debt or liquidity requirements, which could result in \nthe need to issue additional qualifying securities or to take other actions, \nsuch as to sell company assets. \nWe are subject to U.S. regulatory capital and liquidity rules.

It is possible that regulators may increase \nregulatory capital requirements including TLAC and long-term debt requirements, \nchange how regulatory capital is calculated or increase liquidity requirements. Our \nrisk-based capital surcharge (G-SIB surcharge) may increase from current \nestimates, and we are also subject to a countercyclical capital buffer which, while \ncurrently set at zero, may be increased by regulators. In 2018, the Federal Reserve \nissued a proposal to implement a stress capital buffer into its capital requirements, \nwhich may increase our regulatory capital requirements, if adopted. A significant \ncomponent of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our risk-weighted assets and \nour leverage exposure which may increase. The Basel Committee on Banking \nSupervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring risk-\nweighted assets, including a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized \napproach for operational risk and constraints on the use of internal models, as well \nas a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches. U.S. banking \nregulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee \nrevisions. In 2018, U.S. banking regulators published a proposal outlining a \nstandardized approach for counterparty credit risk, which updates the calculation of \nthe exposure amount for derivative contracts under the regulatory capital rule. \nAdditionally, Net Stable Funding Ratio requirements have been proposed, which \nwould apply to us and our subsidiary depository institutions, and target longer term \nliquidity risk. While the impact of these proposals remains uncertain, they could \nhave a negative impact on our capital and liquidity positions. \nAs part of its annual CCAR review, the Federal Reserve conducts stress testing \non parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the \nFederal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test results, which \nmay have an effect on our projected regulatory capital amounts in the annual \nCCAR submission, including the CCAR capital plan affecting our dividends and \nstock repurchases. \nChanges to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements \nmay impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets, increase borrowings, \nissue additional equity or other securities, cease or alter certain operations, sell \ncompany assets, or hold highly liquid assets, which may adversely affect our results \nof operations. We may be prohibited from taking capital actions such as paying or \nincreasing dividends, or repurchasing securities if the Federal Reserve objects to \nour CCAR capital plan. \nFor more information, see Capital Management \u2013 Regulatory Capital in the \nMD&A on page 44 and Note 16 \u2013 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements. \nChanges in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting \npolicies could adversely affect us. \nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and \nreport our financial condition and results of operations.

For additional information, see Capital \nManagement on page 43. \nU.K. Exit from the EU \nWe conduct business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily through our \nsubsidiaries in the U.K. and Ireland. A referendum held in the U.K. in 2016 resulted \nin a majority vote in favor of exiting the European Union (EU). In March 2017, the \nU.K. notified the EU of its intent to withdraw from the EU, which is scheduled to \noccur on March 29, 2019. Negotiations between the U.K. and the EU regarding the \nterms, conditions and timing of the withdrawal are ongoing and the outcome \nremains uncertain. In preparation for the withdrawal, we have implemented changes \nto our operating model in the region, including establishing our principal EU banking \nand broker-dealer operations outside the U.K. The changes are expected to enable \nus to continue to service our clients with minimal disruption, retain operational \nflexibility, minimize transition risks and maximize legal entity efficiencies, \nindependent of the outcome and timing of the withdrawal. \nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates \nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the London InterBank \nOffered Rate (LIBOR), announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or \nrequire banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. This announcement along with \nfinancial benchmark reforms more generally and changes in the interbank lending \nmarkets have resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR and certain other \nrates or indices used as interest rate \u201cbenchmarks.\u201d These actions and \nuncertainties may trigger future changes in the rules or methodologies used to \ncalculate benchmarks or lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks. \nThe Corporation has established an enterprise-wide initiative to identify, assess \nand monitor risks associated with the potential discontinuation or unavailability of \nbenchmarks, including LIBOR, and the transition to alternative reference rates. As \npart of this initiative, the Corporation is actively engaged with global regulators, \nindustry working groups and trade associations to develop strategies for transitions \nfrom current benchmarks to alternative reference rates. We are updating our \noperational processes and models to support new alternative reference rate \n21 Bank of America 2018 activity.

Other income for 2017 included a downward valuation adjustment of $946 \nmillion on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act \nand a $793 million pretax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-\nU.S. consumer credit card business.

In the consumer portfolio, \nthe impact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in 2017 was \nmore than offset by a slower pace of improvement in the consumer real estate \nportfolio, and portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. \nFor more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit \nLosses on page 67. \nNoninterest Expense \nTable 3 Noninterest Expense \n(Dollars in millions) \nPersonnel Occupancy Equipment Marketing Professional fees \nData processing \nTelecommunications Other general operating \nTotal noninterest expense $ \n$ 2018 \n31,880 \n4,066 \n1,705 1,674 1,699 3,222 \n699 \n8,436 \n53,381 $ \n$ 2017 \n31,931 \n4,009 \n1,692 1,746 1,888 3,139 \n699 \n9,639 \n54,743 \nNoninterest expense decreased $1.4 billion to $53.4 billion in 2018 compared to \n2017.", "start_char_idx": 794, "end_char_idx": 4458, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5eb05609-ac78-42d4-ab34-7259f925e69e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5eb05609-ac78-42d4-ab34-7259f925e69e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bc3a7d2e-fa19-4c67-9d20-97a24ac82289", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5bb1cc53b8623bf09fad6b8b8f4acfbf5ac1e816b97b2391e0b7af9f30701b8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cce5111b-6bec-4b06-85ce-e564c501803c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "081091112db384806bd9ac4b39c75c6f64a0a169c76f369b68f956ff1d37c1ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "951dc9f2-98cc-4ed2-831d-e8ebd28e96d0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "136488f9ae01a234cd1a71f4e640e4a76c3f26c638315c0d1604e8fcf6797d90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a2398eb5ce7007b41241dfb6945abcb2a373546452e33591e8d70d54f8eb7c4a", "text": "credit card portfolio. \nFor more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit \nLosses on page 67. \nNoninterest Expense \nTable 3 Noninterest Expense \n(Dollars in millions) \nPersonnel Occupancy Equipment Marketing Professional fees \nData processing \nTelecommunications Other general operating \nTotal noninterest expense $ \n$ 2018 \n31,880 \n4,066 \n1,705 1,674 1,699 3,222 \n699 \n8,436 \n53,381 $ \n$ 2017 \n31,931 \n4,009 \n1,692 1,746 1,888 3,139 \n699 \n9,639 \n54,743 \nNoninterest expense decreased $1.4 billion to $53.4 billion in 2018 compared to \n2017.

We believe that cash flows from operations, available cash \nbalances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are \nsufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities primarily \ninclude the debt securities portfolio and loans and leases. Our financing activities \nreflect cash flows primarily related to customer deposits, securities financing \nagreements and long-term debt. For more information on liquidity, see Liquidity \nRisk on page 47. \nSupplemental Financial Data \nIn this Form 10-K, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP \nfinancial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that \ndiffer from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with \nGAAP . Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information \nto assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period \noperating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. \nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP \nfinancial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-\nGAAP financial measures used by other companies. We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, \nwhich when presented on a consolidated basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. \nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt \nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income \ntax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we used the federal statutory tax rate \nof 21 percent for 2018 (35 percent for all prior periods) and a representative state \ntax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost \nof funds, utilizes net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. We \nbelieve that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of \namounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry \npractices. \nWe may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain \nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-\nGAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that \nexclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional \ninformation to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our \nbusinesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating \nperformance. \nWe also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible \nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.", "start_char_idx": 881, "end_char_idx": 5250, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2bd6a71-7573-44fe-a28f-dbe0acff70bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2bd6a71-7573-44fe-a28f-dbe0acff70bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ac69e6d-4c4f-43df-8530-c6b09b5304e6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f4389c1682bd6741cdccbc761c3915a90586600651b76b8dd5ea2a6230543a35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b4a0489-1534-4be4-b0c7-9846f8e3ee55", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c059c07655a2cf09f15968ee828d5f6ed41f01beec972721ada24103ba38d4f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "747aedaf-3d2e-4124-b9f4-c57630fe05e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bd7f5010906c4019c669f4cbfcd630f4716e99e7489d8eea2e1da24c903711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "10244d1a0056395855ee11660e5f56dc7facb391095037560a20d057866a963c", "text": "Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost \nof funds, utilizes net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis.

Tangible equity represents an adjusted \nshareholders\u2019 equity or common shareholders\u2019 equity amount which has been \nreduced by goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding mortgage \nservicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are \nused to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and \ninvestment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders\u2019 \nequity and return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to \nsupport our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: \n\u25cf Return on average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity measures our \nearnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders\u2019 equity. \nThe tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common \nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired \nintangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. \n\u25cf Return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity measures our earnings \ncontribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders\u2019 equity. The \ntangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity divided by \ntotal assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding \nMSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. \n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common \nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. \nWe believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional \nuseful information because they present measures of those assets that can \ngenerate income.

Our customers and clients have access to a coast to coast \nnetwork including financial centers in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Our \nnetwork includes approximately 4,300 financial centers, approximately 16,300 \nATMs, nationwide call centers, and leading digital banking platforms with more than \n36 million active users, including over26 million active mobile users. \nConsumer Banking Results \nNet income for Consumer Banking increased $3.8 billion to $12.0 billion in 2018 \ncompared to 2017 primarily driven by higher pretax income and lower income tax \nexpense from the reduction in the federal income tax rate. The increase in pretax \nincome was driven by higher revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially \noffset by higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $2.8 \nbillion to $27.1 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in \ninvestable assets as a result of an increase in deposits, as well as higher interest \nrates, pricing discipline and loan growth. Noninterest income increased $186 million \nt o $10.4 billion driven by higher card income, partially offset by lower mortgage \nbanking income, which is included in all other income. The provision for credit losses increased $139 million to $3.7 billion driven by \nportfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Noninterest \nexpense decreased $82 million to $17.7 billion driven by operating efficiencies and \nlower litigation and FDIC expense. These decreases were partially offset by \ninvestments in digital capabilities and business growth, including primary sales \nprofessionals, combined with investments in new financial centers and renovations. \nThe return on average allocated capital was33 percent, up from22 percent, \ndriven by higher net income. For more information on capital allocated to the \nbusiness segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 30. \nDeposits \nDeposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a \ncomprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our \ndeposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings \naccounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest- and interest-bearingchecking accounts, \nas well as investment accounts and products. Net interest income is allocated to the \ndeposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and \nliabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics.

The pretax loss for \n2018 compared to 2017 decreased $1.4 billion primarily due to lower noninterest \nexpense. \nRevenue increased $73 million to a loss of $711 million primarily due to gains of \n$731 million from the sale of consumer real estate loans, primarily non-core, offset \nby a $729 million charge related to the redemption of certain trust preferred \nsecurities in 2018. Results for 2017 included a downward valuation adjustment of \n$946 million on tax-advantaged energy investment s in connection with the Tax Act \nand a pretax gain of $793 million recognized in connection with the sale of the non-\nU.S. consumer credit card business in 2017. \nNoninterest expense decreased $1.5 billion to $2.6 billion primarily due to lower \nnon-core mortgage costs and reduced operational costs from the sale of the non-\nU.S. consumer credit card business. Also, the prior-year period included a $316 \nmillion impairment charge related to certain data centers. \nThe income tax benefit was $2.7 billion in 2018 compared to a benefit of$1.0 \nbillion in 2017. The increase in the tax benefit was primarily driven by a charge of \n$1.9 billion in 2017 related to impacts of the Tax Act for the lower valuation of \ncertain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Both periods included income tax benefit \nadjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global \nBanking . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual \nObligations\nWe have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease \nagreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into \ncontractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or \nservices from unaffiliated parties. Purchase obligations are defined as obligations \nthat are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or \nservices with a specific minimum quantity at a fixed, minimum or variable price over \na specified period of time.

Sound risk management enables us to \nserve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks \ncan result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our \nreputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business \nstrategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined \nRisk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved \nannually by the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the Board. \nThe seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, \nmarket, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. \n\u25cf Strategic risk is the risk resulting from incorrect assumptions about external or \ninternal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy \nexecution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, \nmacroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in \nwhich we operate. \n\u25cf Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or \ncounterparty to meet its obligations. \n\u25cf Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact \nthe value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. \n\u25cf Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and \ncollateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers \nunder a range of economic conditions. \n\u25cf Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss \nor damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the \nCorporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and \nregulations and our internal policies and procedures. \n\u25cf Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, \npeople and systems, or from external events. \n\u25cf Reputational risk is the risk that negative perceptions of the Corporation\u2019s \nconduct or business practices may adversely impact its profitability or \noperations. \nThe following sections address in more detail the specific procedures, measures \nand analyses of the major categories of risk. This discussion of managing risk \nfocuses on the current Risk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, \nwas approved by the ERC and the Board. \nAs set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing risk well is \nfundamental to fulfilling our purpose and our values and delivering responsible \ngrowth. It requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary \nmindset and behavior to enable effective risk management, and promotes sound \nrisk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the \norganization is critical to our success and is a clear expectation of our executive \nmanagement team and the Board. \nOur Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective \nmanagement of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear \nroles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a \nblueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and \nexecutive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. \nExecutive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted returns \nof each business. Management reviews and approves the strategic and financial \noperating plans, as well as the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and \nrecommends them annually to the Board for approval. Our strategic plan takes into \nconsideration return objectives and financial resources, which must align with risk \ncapacity and risk appetite. Management sets financial objectives for each business \nby allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business. \nCapital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall \ngovernance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which \nwe operate continue to evolve.

Our risk appetite provides \na common and comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board \nto clearly indicate our aggregate level of risk and to monitor whether the \nCorporation\u2019s risk profile remains in alignment with our strategic and capital plans. \nOur risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which \nincludes both qualitative components and quantitative limits. \nOur overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we \ntake in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial \nposition so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage \nof organic growth opportunities. Therefore, we set objectives and targets for capital \nand liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and \nsound manner, including during periods of stress. \nOur lines of business operate with risk limits (which may include credit, market \nand/or operational limits, as applicable) that align with the Corporation\u2019s risk \nappetite. Executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting \nperformance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. The \nBoard, and its committees when appropriate, oversees financial performance, \nexecution of the strategic and financial operating plans, adherence to risk appetite \nlimits and the adequacy of internal controls. \nFor a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the \ndiscussion below and pages 43 through 77. \nRisk Management Governance \nThe Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby the Board and its \ncommittees may delegate authority to management-level committees or executive \nofficers.

It approves the Risk \nFramework and the Risk Appetite Statement and further recommends these \ndocuments to the Board for approval. The ERC oversees senior management\u2019s \n41 Bank of America 2018 responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key \nrisks we face. The ERC may consult with other Board committees on risk-related \nmatters. \nOther Board Committees \nOur Corporate Governance Committee oversees our Board\u2019s governance \nprocesses, identifies and reviews the qualifications of potential Board members, \nrecommends nominees for election to our Board, recommends committee \nappointments for Board approval and reviews our Environmental, Social and \nGovernance and stock holder engagement activities. \nOur Compensation and Benefits Committee oversees establishing, maintaining \nand administering our compensation programs and employee benefit plans, \nincluding approving and recommending our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s (CEO) \ncompensation to our Board for further approval by all independent directors, and \nreviewing and approving all of our executive officers\u2019 compensation, as well as \ncompensation for non-management directors. \nManagement Committees \nManagement committees may receive their authority from the Board, a Board \ncommittee, another management committee or from one or more executive officers. \nOur primary management-level risk committee is the Management Risk Committee \n(MRC). Subject to Board oversight, the MRC is responsible for management \noversight of key risks facing the Corporation. This includes providing management \noversight of our compliance and operational risk programs, balance sheet and \ncapital management, funding activities and other liquidity activities, stress testing, \ntrading activities, recovery and resolution planning, model risk, subsidiary \ngovernance and activities between member banks and their nonbank affiliates \npursuant to Federal Reserve rules and regulations, among other things. \nLines of Defense \nWe have clear ownership and accountability across three lines of defense: Front \nLine Units (FLUs), IRM and Corporate Audit.

Each of these \nfunctional roles is described in more detail below. \nExecutive Officers \nExecutive officers lead various functions representing the functional roles. Authority \nfor functional roles may be delegated to executive officers from the Board, Board \ncommittees or management-level committees. Executive officers, in turn, may \nfurther delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level committees, \nmanagement routines or individuals. Executive officers review our activities for \nconsistency with our Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement and applicable \nstrategic, capital and financial operating plans, as well as applicable policies, \nstandards, procedures and processes. Executive officers and other employees \nmake decisions individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they \nhave been delegated. Executive officers and other employees may also serve on \ncommittees and participate in committee decisions. \nFront Line Units \nFLUs, which include the lines of business as well as the Global Technology and \nOperations Group, are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively \nmanaging all of the risks associated with their activities. \nThree organizational units that include FLU activities and control function \nactivities, but are not part of IRM are the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Group, \nGlobal Marketing and Corporate Affairs (GM&CA) and the Chief Administrative \nOfficer (CAO) Group. \nIndependent Risk Management \nIRM is part of our control functions and includes Global Risk Management and \nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk. We have other control functions that are \nnot part of IRM (other control functions may also provide oversight to FLU \nactivities), including Legal, Global Human Resources and certain activities within \nthe CAO Group, CFO Group and GM&CA. IRM, led by the Chief Risk Officer \n(CRO), is responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risks within \nFLUs and other control functions. IRM establishes written enterprise policies and \nprocedures that include concentration risk limits, where appropriate. Such policies \nand procedures outline how aggregate risks are identified, measured, monitored \nand controlled. \nThe CRO has the stature, authority and independence to develop and \nimplement a meaningful risk management framework. The CRO has unrestricted \naccess to the Board and reports directly to both the ERC and to the CEO. Global \nRisk Management is organized into horizontal risk teams, front line unit risk teams \nand control function risk teams that work collaboratively in executing their \nrespective duties. \nCorporate Audit \nCorporate Audit and the CGA maintain their independence from the FLUs, IRM and \nother control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee or the Board. \nThe CGA administratively reports to the CEO. Corporate Audit provides \nindependent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and \ncontrols across the Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit Review which \nperiodically tests and examines credit portfolios and processes. \nRisk Management Processes \nThe Risk Framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated \nin key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and in day-to-day business \nprocesses across the Corporation, with a goal of ensuring risks are appropriately considered, \nevaluated and responded to in a timely manner. \nWe employ our risk management process, referred to as Identify, Measure, \nMonitor and Control, as part of our daily activities. \nIdentify \u2013 To be effectively managed, risks must be clearly defined and proactively \nidentified. Proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding \nkey risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from \nexternal factors.

Risk identification is an ongoing process, incorporating input from FLUs \nand control functions, designed to be forward looking and capture relevant risk \nfactors across all of our lines of business. \nMeasure \u2013 Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and accurately measured \nthrough a systematic risk quantification process including quantitative and \nqualitative components. Risk is measured at various levels including, but not \nlimited to, risk type, FLU, legal entity and on an aggregate basis.

We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse systemic impacts \nthat could be associated with a potential resolution of Bank of America. \nStrategic Risk Management \nStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories \nalong with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. \nThis risk results from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, \ninappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to \nrespond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or \ncompetitive environments, in the geographic locations in which we operate, such as \ncompetitor actions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence and \ntechnology developments. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, \ncapital plan and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks. \nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the strategic plan, capital \nplan, financial operating plan and Risk Appetite Statement. With oversight by the \nBoard, executive management directs the lines of business to execute our strategic \nplan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. The executive \nmanagement team monitors business performance throughout the year and \nprovides the Board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives \nand timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or \nalternative actions need to be considered or implemented. The regular executive \nreviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current \nrisk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes \nrequired to support the strategic plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative \nfactors such as market growth rates and peer analysis. \nSignificant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or \ndivestitures, and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by the Board.

In addition to the previously \nannounced repurchases associated with the 2018 CCAR capital plan, on February \n7, 2019, we announced a plan to repurchase an additional $2.5 billion of common \nstock through June 30, 2019, which was approved by the Federal Reserve. \nDuring 2018, pursuant to the Board\u2019s authorizations, including those related to \nour 2017 CCAR capital plan that expired June 30, 2018, we repurchased $20.1 \nbillion of common stock, which includes common stock repurchases to offset equity-\nbased", "start_char_idx": 4876, "end_char_idx": 8670, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95303bc6-5e4f-44f8-a77c-64f300e4beb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "95303bc6-5e4f-44f8-a77c-64f300e4beb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "68ee36b4-b5ed-493a-9e24-b62cf7b78d2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f1ae5c11e7d159633651d7c1d8fd255476b06b5558d1c4d75013a136d07ee8be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d01c26c7-33a8-4c89-a7c2-e99e319168d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "064db58625696d5243a7cb0763b68a3998f1211aa38c7ad66ab976e5e545ffda", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e7b1ec5-5be1-4aaa-9165-3dc73eb3b8b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "08c6a4384c54f630e3b87bae0bdbd4b40db39832971fcd09fb2f28d05f8bbef8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ded09497a59847734a9bdacc0e86e16b6a884d6b6f15030d33d75b313079357c", "text": "compensation awards. At December 31, 2018, our remaining stock repurchase \nauthorization was $10.3 billion. \nOur stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation\u2019s \ncapital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock \ntrading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. \nThe repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately \nnegotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of \nRule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make \nadditional capital distributions not to exceed 0.25 percent of Tier 1 capital, and \nwhich were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s \nnon-objection. \nRegulatory Capital \nAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, \nincluding Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3 established minimum \ncapital ratios and buffer requirements and outlined two methods of calculating risk-\nweighted assets, the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches. The \nStandardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on \nexposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk weights based on \ninternal models. \nThe Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced \napproaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-\nbased capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and \nAdvanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess \ncapital adequacy including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. \nAs of December 31, 2018, Common equity tier 1 (CET1) and Tier 1 capital ratios for \nthe Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach whereas the \nAdvanced approaches yielded a lower Total capital ratio. Minimum Capital Requirements \nMinimum capital requirements and related buffers were fully phased in as of \nJanuary 1, 2019. The PCA framework established categories of capitalization, \nincluding well capitalized, based on the Basel 3 regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. \nbanking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the \ncategory of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for well-capitalized \nbanking organizations. \nIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus \npayments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that \ninclude a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable \ncountercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) \nsurcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital \nand were phased in over a three-year period that ended January 1, 2019. \nThe Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage \nratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid \ncertain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our \ninsured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 \npercent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. The \nnumerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total \nleverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet \nexposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain \noff-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. \nCapital Composition and Ratios \nTable 13 presents Bank of America Corporation\u2019s capital ratios and related \ninformation in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as \nmeasured at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

For more information on this standard, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of \nSignificant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The \nfinal rule provides an option to phase in the impact to regulatory capital over a \nthree-year period on a straight-line basis. It also updates the existing regulatory \ncapital framework by creating a new defined term, adjusted allowance for credit \nlosses, which would include credit losses on all financial instruments measured at \namortized cost with the exception of purchased credit-deteriorated assets. The final \nrule continues to allow a limited amount of credit losses to be recognized in Tier 2 \ncapital and maintains the existing limits under the Standardized and Advanced \napproaches. \nSingle-Counterparty Credit Limits \nOn June 14, 2018, the Federal Reserve published a final rule establishing single-\ncounterparty credit limits (SCCL) for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $250 \nbillion or more. The SCCL rule is designed to ensure that the maximum possible \nloss that a BHC could incur due to the default of a single counterparty or a group of \nconnected counterparties would not endanger the BHC\u2019s survival, thereby reducing \nthe probability of future financial crises. Beginning January 1, 2020, G-SIBs must \ncalculate SCCL on a daily basis by dividing the aggregate net credit exposure to a \ngiven counterparty by the G-SIB\u2019s Tier 1 capital, ensuring that exposures to other \nG-SIBs and nonbank financial institutions regulated by the Federal Reserve do not \nbreach 15 percent of Tier 1 capital and exposures to most other counterparties do \nnot breach 25 percent of Tier 1 capital. Certain exposures, including exposures to \nthe U.S. government, U.S. government-sponsored entities and qualifying central \ncounterparties, are exempt from the credit limits. \nBroker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation \nThe Corporation\u2019s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, \nPierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional \nClearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and \nprovides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital \nrequirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15c3-1. Both \nentities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17. \nMLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in \naccordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC \nRule 15c3-1. At December 31, 2018, MLPF&S\u2019 regulatory net capital as defined by \nRule 15c3-1 was $13.4 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $2.0 \nbillion by $11.4 billion. MLPCC\u2019s net capital of $4.4 billion exceeded the minimum \nrequirement of $617 million by $3.8 billion. \nIn accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is \nrequired to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in \nexcess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less \nthan $5.0 billion. At December 31, 2018, MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net \ncapital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. \nAs a result of resolution planning, the current business of MLPF&S is expected \nto be reorganized into two affiliated broker-\n47 Bank of America 2018 dealers: MLPF&S and BofA Securities, Inc., a newly formed broker-dealer.

To achieve that objective, we \nanalyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, \nmaintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable \ndeposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. \nWe define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, \nliquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and \ncontingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity \nposition through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal \nentity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis \nunder both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized \napproach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor \nliquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing \ncosts and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. \nThe Board approves our liquidity risk policy and the Financial Contingency and \nRecovery Plan. The ERC establishes our liquidity risk tolerance levels. The MRC is \nresponsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain \nexposures within the established tolerance levels. The MRC reviews and monitors \nour liquidity position and stress testing results, approves certain liquidity risk limits \nand reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. For more information, \ns e e Managing Risk on page 40. Under this governance framework, we have \ndeveloped certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: \nmaintaining liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our \nbank subsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity \nare appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other \npotential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed \nmarket conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and \nlegal entity structure; and performing contingency planning. \nNB Holdings Corporation \nWe have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we \ntransferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, \nwhich is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank \nsubsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not \nneeded to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a \nwholly-owned holding company subsidiary", "start_char_idx": 4267, "end_char_idx": 8468, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbb09327-e362-4584-a6b4-e991e302fc4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbb09327-e362-4584-a6b4-e991e302fc4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18e66522-c624-4d77-930e-8e2e18e60dbb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "ace8f0e06f8285122fdd6b9eb9fb8c2bd4c2009633ad190f5d876621504abf20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "27bc32ae-5b65-4f3d-b9a5-47f84ae52fbd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "1fc3b6d9ebebdb09deb813ec7750da9e41d24823617d22912ee1996697069ae5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc4bcf29-8f2d-4643-a072-ef1c51965588", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8fcaaae1867478c6567a99b98d01c1e60cff525686b77074b086cd38554565c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "905a06f5f9b1d6605721b5de928d94069051e0e46b8bf1c04d7a628c09d37737", "text": "(NB Holdings).

We also use the stress modeling results to \nmanage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain \nfunding sources and businesses. \nNet Stable Funding Ratio \nU.S. banking regulators issued a proposal for a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) \nrequirement applicable to U.S. financial institutions following the Basel Committee\u2019s \nfinal standard. The proposed U.S. NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a \nconsolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. While the final \nrequirement remains pending and is subject to change, if finalized as proposed, we \nexpect to be in compliance within the regulatory timeline. The standard is intended \nto reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon. The NSFR is designed to provide \nan appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and liabilities maturing \nbeyo nd one year, given the mix of assets and off-balance sheet items. \nDiversified Funding Sources \nWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured \nliabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified \nacross products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. \nThe primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater contro l, \nreduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to \nmeet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time \nzone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding \nimpractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. \nWe fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, \nwhich were $1.38 trillion and $1.31 trillion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. \nDeposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking , GWIM and Global \nBanking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and \ngeography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We \nconsider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent \nsource of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to \ninterest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than \nwholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through \nsecured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing Administration \n(FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. \nOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a \nsecured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these \namounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe \nfunding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and \nless sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. \nRepurchase agreements are generally short-term and \n49 Bank of America 2018 often overnight.

We periodically review and test the \ncontingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. \nOur U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal \nReserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central \nbank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on \nthese sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and \ngovernance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. \nCredit Ratings \nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In \naddition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we \ncompete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, \nincluding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain \nhigh-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the \nmajor rating agencies. \nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies o n our \ncreditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and \nother securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to \nongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, \nincluding our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well \nas factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our \nratings at any time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our \nratings at current levels. \nOther factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating \nagencies\u2019 methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating \nagencies\u2019 assessment of the general operating environment for financial services \ncompanies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various \nrisk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and \nother contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, \ndiversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and \nvolatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our \ncorporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current \nor future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies\u2019 views on whether \nthe U.S. government would provide meaningful support to the Corporation or its \nsubsidiaries in a crisis.", "start_char_idx": 935, "end_char_idx": 5574, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65a358a1-2fc1-4548-8e13-8fbf25e7a654": {"__data__": {"id_": "65a358a1-2fc1-4548-8e13-8fbf25e7a654", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54227e30-6beb-4dbd-a101-31ba79056c9f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b9f965af0e19aecae9743a72c4fb6113c613faa9b2a4840d53c94b93f70c5955", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eba7fcec-79e8-4e46-a780-ab15c872ec74", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f339873d4658e1e2d46a33eb764b04b9556c3a07ea7586467a55f382e9021704", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aec3ebab-a6ec-4116-bf13-3c710b0375ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cb94a25b5017e2e15541b74ae9f3110034b7aef28be7fe4abc20938bbe783bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0a6394833ab841205e21d7eba7b6d210f3307caf66e38dbd8c68c0afc51a775a", "text": "Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating \nagencies\u2019 methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating \nagencies\u2019 assessment of the general operating environment for financial services \ncompanies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various \nrisk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and \nother contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, \ndiversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and \nvolatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our \ncorporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current \nor future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies\u2019 views on whether \nthe U.S. government would provide meaningful support to the Corporation or its \nsubsidiaries in a crisis. \nOn December 5, 2018, Moody\u2019s Investors Service (Moody\u2019s) placed the long-\nterm and short-term ratings of the Corporation as well as the long-term ratings of its \nrated subsidiaries, including BANA, on review for upgrade. The agency cited the \nCorporation\u2019s strengthening profitability, continued adherence to a conservative risk \nprofile, and stable capital ratios as drivers of the review.

The last change to the ratings from \nS&P was a one-notch upgrade of the Corporation\u2019s long-term ratings in November \n2017 . \nOn June 21, 2018, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) upgraded the Corporation\u2019s long-term \nsenior debt rating to A+ from A as part of the agency\u2019s latest review of 12 Global \nTrading & Investment Banks, citing our sustained and improved risk-adjusted \nearnings, lower risk appetite relative to peers, overall franchise strength and solid \nliquidity position. The Corporation\u2019s short-term debt rating of F1 was affirmed. \nAdditionally, Fitch upgraded the long- and short-term debt ratings of the \nCorporation\u2019s rated U.S. subsidiaries, including BANA and MLPF&S, and upgraded \nthe long-term debt ratings of our rated international subsidiaries, including MLI.

Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed \nCLTV greater than 100 percent, 96 percent of the customers were current on their \nhome equity loan and 91 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV \ngreater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying \nfirst-lien loans at December 31, 2018. \nOf the $47.4 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings atDecember 31, \n2018, as shown in Table 26, 20 percent require interest-only payments. The \noutstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and \nhave entered the amortization period was $15.8 billion at December 31, 2018. The \nHELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher \npercentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared \nto the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2018, $267 million, or two \npercent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortiz ation period were \naccruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at December 31, 2018, $1.7 billion, \nor 11 percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period \nwere nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our \ninterest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better \ncredit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. \nWe communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the \nend of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment \nstructure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to \ncustomers prior to the end of the draw period. \nAlthough we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay \nonly the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer \nsome of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service \nand that is still in its revolving period.

Residential mortgage and home equity loans with a refreshed \nLTV or CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting \nadjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 10 percent and 28 \npercent of their respective PCI loan portfolios and 11 percent and \n57 Bank of America 2018 32 percent based on the unpaid principal balance atDecember 31, 2018. \nU.S. Credit Card \nAt December 31, 2018, 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in \nConsumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the U.S. credit \ncard portfolio increased $2.1 billion in 2018 to $98.3 billion due to higher retail \nvolume partially offset by payments as well as the sale of a small portfolio. In 2018, \nnet charge-offs increased $324 million to $2.8 billion, and U.S. credit card loans 30 \ndays or more past due and still accruing interest increased $142 million and loans \n90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $94 million, each \ndriven by portfolio season ing and loan growth. \nUnused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $334.8 billion and $326.3 \nbillion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The increase was driven by account growth \nand lines of credit increases. \nTable 29 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.", "start_char_idx": 3718, "end_char_idx": 6317, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b02fba2c-35d6-4843-90e5-55af7a575c2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b02fba2c-35d6-4843-90e5-55af7a575c2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b158b58a-2517-4459-a3a9-f1fb02fab946", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "889696bea6e7112b75eae587b28a0d3a899920ec8e8a0dab3dc6101f95ffa153", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c74b33e1-81b4-46cc-b969-b4b12171f18c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "881eb8459fc02c8dcc90eda21e5f468de758a198bf87875534d67461d588457d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "92979703-8d90-415d-84da-5f6f92963cda", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe0b4a26d651916b6e35b003caecd34e09a8e74ab0a75b7e864407be6e1d3923", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "782f0badedc0637a708e21ef0860a58ba815b3f7b5511a4847c5f4d89a370f88", "text": "Table \n29 U.S. Credit Card State Concentrations \n(Dollars in millions) \nCalifornia \nFlorida Texas New York \nWashington Other \nTotal U.S. credit card portfolio $ \n$ Outstandings \n2018 \n16,062 $ \n8,840 7,730 \n6,066 \n4,558 \n55,082 \n98,338 $ December 31 \n2017 \n15,254 $ \n8,359 7,451 5,977 4,350 \n54,894 \n96,285 $ Accruing Past Due \n90 Days or More \n2018 2017 \n163 $ \n119 \n84 81 24 \n523 \n994 $ 136 \n94 76 91 20 \n483 \n900 $ \n$ Net Charge-offs \n2018 2017 \n479 $ 412 \n332 259 \n224 194 \n268 218 \n63 56 \n1,471 1,374 \n2,837 $ 2,513 \nDirect/Indirect Consumer \nAt December 31, 2018, 55 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in \nConsumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending \u2013 automotive, marine, \naircraft, recreational vehicle loans and consumer personal loans) and 45 percent \nwas included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). \nOutstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $5.2 billion in 2018 to \n$91.2 billion primarily due to declines in securities-based lending due to higher paydowns, and in our auto portfolio as \npaydowns outpaced originations.

Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are \nmonitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary , adjusted to reflect changes in the \nfinancial condition, \n59 Bank of America 2018 cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit \ndecisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name \nconcentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the total \nborrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools to continuously \nmonitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We \nuse risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within \nportfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated \ncapital and the allowance for credit losses. \nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients \nexperiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with \ntheir current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been \ngranted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as \nTDRs. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, \nnonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 \u2013 \nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial \nStatements . \nManagement of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations \nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations \nof credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, \nmeasure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, \ngeography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measu re and \nmanage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property", "start_char_idx": 3488, "end_char_idx": 7169, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b5ceccc-dfdd-4d0b-b033-c8b9b531b2f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b5ceccc-dfdd-4d0b-b033-c8b9b531b2f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aec021be-dfae-4c03-8d47-bcd60be4e8ff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "16ea8a1f3e46853e2168c74a85fc391a1ed0add28646aa898f8f02908472166b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "896e5665-8b93-4f92-a274-0e5c8a29301b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c11b876a3f4ed89bd27b07679e1c0e6de3c035212b3bc50eb29e23d08d6402a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d62520f6-0904-4323-802b-149dbf56fc0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba44a8849cd025358ec007d36141f0b403f802574429bd1366ff1bb4cf3ba566", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a6ca3b9551dce0946059d519ecccf1c874ab14fe629b29e0cb8e54d4a47bf74f", "text": "type.

The provision for credit \nlosses was $481 million lower than net charge-offs for 2018, resulting ina reduction \nin the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $583 million in \nthe allowance for credit losses in 2017. \nThe provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolioincreased $222 million \nto $2.9 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a \nslower pace of improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio, and portfolio \nseasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio, partially offset by the \nimpact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in 2017. \nThe provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded \nlending commitments, decreased $336 million to $333 million in 2018 compared to \n2017. The decrease was primarily driven by a 2017 single-name non-U.S. \ncommercial charge-off and improvement in the commercial portfolio. \nAllowance for Credit Losses \nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses \nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first \ncomponent covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second \ncomponent covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not \nyet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented \nin the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan \nand lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is \ndescribed in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes \nloans held-for-sale (LHFS) and loans accounted for under the fair value option as \nthe fair value reflects a credit risk component. \nThe first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both \nnonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial \nportfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the \npresent value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s original \neffective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based \nupon the collateral value or the loan\u2019s observable market price if available. \nImpairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card, small business \ncredit card and unsecured consumer TDR portfolios is based on the present value \nof projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest \nrate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For \npurposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger \nimpaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated \nas a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk \nratings of the loans. \nThe second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the \nremaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses \nthat are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer (including \ncredit card and other consumer loans) and certain homogeneous commercial loan \nand lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, which include both \nquantitative and qualitative components, generally by product type. Loss forecast \nmodels are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, \nhistorical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio \ntrends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores.

As of \nDecember 31, 2018, the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the \nallowance related to the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios compared \nto December 31, 2017. \nThe allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product \ntype after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic \nconditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations \nwithin each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for \ncommercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database \nof actual defaults and other data, including external default data. The loan risk \nratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the \nallowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the \ncurrent economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the \nprobability of default and the loss given default (LGD) based on our historical \nexperience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the \ninternal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the \nindustry in which the obligor operates, the obligor\u2019s liquidity and other financial \nindicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor\u2019s \ncredit risk. As of December 31, 2018, the allowance for the U.S. commercial and \nnon-U.S. commercial portfolios decreased compared to December 31, 2017. \nAlso included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease \nlosses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may \nnot be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast \nmodels. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in \nlending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, \nchanges in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, \nchanges in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the \neffect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory \nrequirements. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models \nthat are built upon historical data. \nDuring 2018, the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses \nincluded improvement in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios \ndriven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets, \nproactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality \noriginations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor \nmarkets are low levels of unemployment and increases in home prices. In addition \nto these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans \ndecreased $1.3 billion in 2018 as returns to performing status, loan sales, \npaydowns and charge-offs continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. During \n2018, the allowance for loan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflected \ndecreased energy reserves primarily driven by improvement in energy exposures \nincluding reservable criticized utilized exposures.", "start_char_idx": 4649, "end_char_idx": 8913, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1d8c109-e326-47f8-bde3-1155b48e9cd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1d8c109-e326-47f8-bde3-1155b48e9cd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b0e2cca9-55fe-4868-b3e8-69e839d1cf41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "d6299549d77516b891a234a5225ed6a21ceeeebc4dd9c40b9041ae5d8ea10f08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "174d4b47-8914-4b0e-adb5-74f30d0b84bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "44e39160b283fe75b9d24c6ccac9b83de977632f82c6bc718ccdcef825deb37a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8305e106-f757-4fa9-afac-e613a9749d09", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5632e7e5e7bcc07a4327e787e29bb9af844d1482de3e6c9aea96f84b14666ad4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0c88b87595aaa39157070daef1b69c1a5b506705dd78d24b5bf225755c00a107", "text": "We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease \nlosses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior \nmanagement of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred \nlosses in those portfolios. \nThe allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented \nin Table 45, was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $581 million from \nDecember 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily in the consumer real estate \nportfolio, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The \nreduction in the allowance for the consumer real estate portfolio was due to \nimproved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in loan balances \nin our non-core portfolio. The increase in the allowance for the U.S. credi t card \nportfolio was driven by portfolio seasoning and loan growth. \nThe allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as \npresented in Table 45, was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $211 \nmillion from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by improvement in energy \nexposures.

Unfunded lending \ncommitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including \nestimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded \ncommitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization.

This risk is \ninherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within \nour Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of \nthe Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks \ncould have a material impact on our results. For more information, see Interest \nRate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 74. \nOur traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-trading positions and \nare generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities \n(historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic \nvalue based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being \nchanges in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic \nvalue of our non-trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed \nthrough our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and \nliabilities under the fair value option. \nOur trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. \nTrading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. The \nmajority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign \nexchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets \nand liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and \nexpectations of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using \na variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The \nkey risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk \nManagement section. \nGlobal Risk Management is responsible for providing senior management with a \nclear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are \nexposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing \nand maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, \nestablishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting \ndaily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures \nand fulfilling regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of \nGlobal Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance \nfunctions. \nQuantitative risk models, such as VaR, are an essential component in evaluating \nthe market risks within a portfolio. The Enterprise Model Risk Committee (EMRC), a \nsubcommittee of the MRC, is responsible for providing management oversight and \napproval of model risk management and governance. The EMRC defines model risk \nstandards, consistent with our risk framework and risk appetite, prevailing \nregulatory guidance and industry best practice. Models must meet certain validation \ncriteria, including effective challenge of the model development process and a \nsufficient demonstration of developmental evidence incorporating a comparison of \nalternative theories and approaches. The EMRC oversees that model standards are \nconsistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the \nmodel validation process across the Corporation. In addition, the relevant \nstakeholders must agree on any required actions or restrictions to the models and \nmaintain a stringent monitoring process for continued compliance. \nInterest Rate Risk \nInterest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the \nlevel or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, \nloans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. \nHedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as \noptions, futures, forwards and swaps. \nForeign Exchange Risk \nForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current \nholdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. \ndollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. \nsubsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows \nin foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-\ndenominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate \nwith changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest \nrates.

The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, \nmortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government \nparticipation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes \nseveral forms. For example, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a \nvariety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, \ncommercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including \ncollateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral. In addition, \nwe originate a variety of MBS, which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related \nloans in anticipation of eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in \nmortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio.

Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but \nare not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American \nDepositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC \nequity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity \nderivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, \nfutures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions. \nCommodity Risk \nCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, \nnatural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of \nfutures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk \ninclude options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as \nwell as cash positions. \nIssuer Credit Risk \nIssuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of \nindividual issuers or groups of issuers.

Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most \ncomplete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are \nevaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. \nThese measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, \nsuch as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest \nrates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, \nsuch as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the \nreliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market \nrisk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their \nrespective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of \nthe portfolios under the current market environment and potential future \nenvironments. \nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the \naggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A \nVaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to \ngenerate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a \nportfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, \nbased on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. \nWe use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a \nhistorical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our \nprimary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that \nfor a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of \nVaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. \nWithin any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will \ndiffer from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the \navailability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A \nVaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do \nnot have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which \naccurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient \nhistorical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate \nproxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less \nliquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both \nthe expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing \ndata would be expected to experience. \nVaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market \nconditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the \nresults. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate \nhigher \n71 Bank of America 2018 or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the \nVaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data \nunderlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of \nmarket stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A minor \nportion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in VaR. These risks \nare reviewed as part of our ICAAP .

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss \nexceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to \nunderstand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a \ngoal to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We \nexpect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the \nconfidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent \nconfidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or \nbetween two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The \nnumber of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected \nnumber of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than \nthe level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data \nused in the VaR calculation. \nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in \norder to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital \ncalculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it \nexcludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or \nthe market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue \nexcluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and \nintraday trading revenues. \nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital \ncalculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk \nfactors.

This analysis estimates the change in the value of \nour trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. \nA set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypo thetical, are computed \ndaily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios \ninclude shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the \nshocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios \nsimulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended \nhistorical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most \nsevere point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical \nscenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress \nevents. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and \nnew economic or political information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are \ndeveloped to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in \nthe portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are \npresented to senior management. \nStress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress \ntesting and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios \nused for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading \nportfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are \nforecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity \nplanning. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 40. \nInterest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book \nThe following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. \nInterest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our \nbanking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change \nin net interest income caused \nby movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and \ndeposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. \nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline \nforecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning \nand the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based \nforward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest \nrate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate \nsensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently \nupdated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic \ntrends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our \nbalance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to \ninterest rate changes. \nThe interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet \nassumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, \nproduct repricing, maturity characteristi cs and investment securities premium \namortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in \ninterest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. \nTable 49 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline \nforecasts at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 \u2013 \nDerivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOur interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and \nforeign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use \nforeign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign \ncurrency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options to \nmitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated \nassets and liabilities. \nChanges to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during2018 reflect \nactions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The \ndecisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current \nassessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and \nforeign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the \nrelative mix of our cash and derivative positions. \nWe use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash \nflows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively \nreferred to as cash flow hedges).

We determine whether loans will be held for \ninvestment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and \nliquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. \nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. \nChanges in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage \noriginations. Changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock \ncommitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the \ndate of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. An \nincrease in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of \nthese instruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest rates, the \nvalue of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. Because \nthe interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combine them into one \noverall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of \nderivative contracts and securities. \nDuring 2018 and 2017, we recorded gains of $244 million and $118 million \nrelated to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and \nlosses on the hedge portfolio. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair \nValue Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nCompliance and Operational Risk Management \nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or \ndamage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the \nCorporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations \nand our internal policies and procedures (collectively, applicable laws, rules and \nregulations). Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, \npeople and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere \nin the Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to \noperations functions. Effects may extend beyond financial losses and may result in \nreputational risk impacts. Operational risk includes legal risk. Additionally, \noperational risk is a component in the calculation of total risk-weighted assets used \nin the Basel 3 capital calculation. For more information on Basel 3 calculations, see \nCapital Management on page 43. \nFLUs and control functions are first and foremost responsible for managing all \naspects of their businesses, including their compliance and operational risk. FLUs \nand control functions are required to understand their business processes and \nrelated risks and controls, including the related regulatory requirements, and \nmonitor and report on the effectiveness of the control environment. In order to \nactively monitor and assess the performance of their processes and controls, they \nmust conduct comprehensive quality assurance activities and identify issues and \nrisks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and control functions must \nalso adhere to complianc e and operational risk appetite limits to meet strategic, \ncapital and financial planning objectives. Finally, FLUs and control functions are \nresponsible for the proactive identification, management and escalation of \ncompliance and operational risks across the Corporation. \nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk teams independently assess \ncompliance and operational risk, monitor business activities and processes, \nevaluate FLUs and control functions for adherence to applicable laws, rules and \nregulations, including identifying issues and risks, determining and developing tests \nto be conducted by the Enterprise Independent Testing unit, and reporting on the \nstate of the control environment.

The requirements work together to drive a \ncomprehensive risk-based approach for the proactive identification, management \nand escalation of compliance risks throughout the Corporation. For more \ninformation on FLUs and control functions, see Managing Risk on page 40. \nThe Corporation\u2019s approach to operational risk management is outlined in the \nOperational Risk Management - Enterprise Policy which establishes the \nrequirements of the Corporation\u2019s operational risk management program and \nspecifies the responsibilities and accountabilities of the first and second lines of \ndefense for managing operational risk so that our business processes are designed \nand executed effectively. \nThe Global Compliance Enterprise Policy and Operational Risk Management -\nEnterprise Policy also set the requirements for reporting compliance and operational \nrisk information to executive management as well as the Board or appropriate \nBoard-level committees in support of Global Compliance and Operational Risk\u2019s \nresponsibilities for conducting independent oversight of our compliance and \noperational risk management activities. The Board provides oversight of compliance \nrisk through its Audit Committee and the ERC, and operational risk through the \nERC. \nA key operational risk facing the Corporation is information security, which \nincludes cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk represents, among other things, \nexposure to failures or interruptions of service or breaches of security, resulting from \nmalicious technological attacks or otherwise, that impact the confidentiality, \navailability or integrity of our operations, systems or data, including sensitive \ncorporate and customer information.

If reputational risk events occur, we focus on \nremediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize damage to the \nCorporation\u2019s reputation. The Corporation has processes and procedures in place \nto respond to events that give rise to reputational risk, including educating \nindividuals and organizations that influence public opinion, implementing external \ncommunication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of \npotential reputational risks. \n77 Bank of America 2018 The Corporation\u2019s organization and governance structure provides oversight of \nreputational risks, and reputational risk reporting is provided regularly and directly to \nmanagement and the ERC, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk.

Many of our significant accounting \nprinciples require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. \nWe have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. \nThe more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We \nhave identified and described the development of the variables most important in \nthe estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. \nIn many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the \nprocess of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have \nused the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing \nthe inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables \ncould materially impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future \nimpact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our \nlending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent \nto the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of \nfuture credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change \nquickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, \nnegative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be \nindicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. \nAllowance for Credit Losses \nThe allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease \nlosses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the Corporation\u2019s loan \nand lease portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option. \nThe allowance for credit losses includes both quantitative and qualitative \ncomponents. The qualitative component has a higher degree of management \nsubjectivity, and includes factors such as concentrations, economic conditions and \nother considerations.

A one-percent \ndecrease in the expected cash flows would result in a $41 million impairment of the \nportfolio. Within our Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and U.S. \nsmall business commercial card portfolio, for each one-percent increase in the loss \nrates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment coupled with a one-percent \ndecrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for \nimpairment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2018 would \nhave increased $44 million. \nOur allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned \nto loans and leases within the Commercial portfolio segment (excluding the U.S. \nsmall business commercial card portfolio). Assuming a downgrade of one level in \nthe internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases \nalready classified as Substandard and Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, \nthe allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased $2.5 billion at \nDecember 31, 2018. \nThe allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and \nleases at December 31, 2018 was 1.02 percent and these hypothetical increases in \nthe allowance would raise the ratio to 1.30 percent. \nThese sensitivity analyses do not represent management\u2019s expectations of the \ndeterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as \nhypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease \nlosses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities \ncurrently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios \noutlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote. \nThe process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a \nhigh degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may \nat any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions. \nFair Value of Financial Instruments \nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are required to maximize the use of \nobservable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair \nvalue. We classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs \nbased on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards. \nThe fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market \nliquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models \nor other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. \nWhere market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information \nas of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if \nthey are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, \nlessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market \npricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the \nprudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair \nvalue of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that \ninclude: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative \nmodels used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk \nquantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all \ntraded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit \nand loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we \nutilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-\nobservable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on \nthis information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing \nservice develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly \nobservable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own \ninternal modeling. For example, broker quotes in less active markets may only be \nindicative and therefore less reliable. These processes and controls are performed \nindependently of the business.

The fair value of these \nLevel 3 financial assets and liabilities and MSRs is determined using pricing \nmodels, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the \ndetermination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. \nLevel 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level \n1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may \nbe offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other \nlevels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings \ndid not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. We conduct a review of \nour fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of \nLevel 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the \nfair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, \nrespectively, in the current marketplace.

We currently file income tax \nreturns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including \nstatutory, judicial and regulatory guidance , in estimating the appropriate accrued \nincome taxes for each jurisdiction. \nNet deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be \npaid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards \nand because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and \nliabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial \nstatements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax \nliabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain \nperiods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax \nassets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized. \nConsistent with the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax \nauthorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes and/or net deferred \ntax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts \nand regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimates, which also may result \nfrom our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters, \nmay be material to our operating results for any given period. \nBank of America 2018 78", "start_char_idx": 4818, "end_char_idx": 8942, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cff00a2-15d5-41c8-9384-80745c6cb300": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cff00a2-15d5-41c8-9384-80745c6cb300", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eeceac72-6f09-4cd7-87d1-d7c3961e7641", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f4967c03ef63b51af53841b6236222bbae9b338364c73881f11b815f30cdab50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "595f81ce-6289-424b-9489-c5c9e8ce4a57", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "e6934f2560a32221cb770a6aedc8482c4dd86257a19142517be7098489c57c22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6cc4959f-91a5-4fc4-9b23-4f73c026862c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e8878d69b2b08b7e9653cdafa53175a9f38b3896a6b3998318497acc8e48e3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "eea99f76e481eeba15321a4178c0f74d09d951d78c17df4371a8862ebf23a96e", "text": "See Note 19 \u2013 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a \ntable of significant tax attributes and additional information.

Beginning with our annual goodwill impairment test as of June \n30, 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment, rather than a quantitative \nassessment as previously performed, that is more fully described in Note 1 \u2013 \nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial \nStatements . \nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018 for all of \nour reporting units that had goodwill. We performed that test by assessing \nqualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value \nof each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered \nin the qualitative assessments include, among other things, macroeconomic \nconditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the \nrespective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific \nconsiderations. If based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is more \nlikely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a \nquantitative assessment is performed. \nBased on our qualitative assessments, we determined that for each reporting \nunit with goodwill, it was more likely than not that its respective fair value exceeded \nits carrying value, indicating there was no impairment. For more information \nregarding goodwill balances at June 30, 2018, see Note 8 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible \nAssets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . \nRepresentations and Warranties Liability \nThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations \nand warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the \ntype of representations and warranties provided in the sales contracts and \nconsiders a variety of factors. These factors, which incorporate judgment, are \nsubject to change based on our specific experience. Our experience in negotiating \nsettlements with trustees and other counterparties is an important input in \ndetermining our estimate of the liability. We also consider actual defaults, estimated \nfuture defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other \neconomic conditions. Changes to any one of these factors could impact the \nestimate of our liability. \nThe representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period \nas the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined. The \nestimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future \ndefaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous \nincrease or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and \nthe net repurchase rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately \n$200 million in the representations and warranties liability as ofDecember 31, 2018. \nThese sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the \nimpact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and \nwarranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in \nother assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity. \nFor more information on representations and warranties exposure, seeNote 12 \n\u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n79 Bank of America 2018 2017 Compared to 2016 \nThe following discussion and analysis provide a comparison of our results of \noperations for 2017 and 2016.

The results for 2017 included a charge of \n$2.9 billion related to the Tax Act. The pretax results for 2017 compared to 2016 \nwere driven by higher revenue, largely the result of an increase in net interest \nincome, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense. \nNet Interest Income \nNet interest income increased $3.6 billion to $44.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. \nNet interest yield on an FTE basis increased 12 bps to 2.37 percent for 2017. \nThese increases were primarily driven by the benefits from higher interest rates and \nloan and deposit growth, partially offset by the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit \ncard business in the second quarter of 2017. \nNoninterest Income \nNoninterest income increased $80 million to $42.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. \nThe following highlights the significant changes. \n\u25cf Service charges increased $180 million primarily driven by the impact of pricing \nstrategies and higher treasury services related revenue. \n\u25cf Investment and brokerage services income increased $487 million primarily \ndriven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset \nby the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM \npricing. \n\u25cf Investment banking income increased $770 million primarily due to higher \nadvisory fees and higher debt and equity issuance fees. \n\u25cf Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client \nfinancing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most \nfixed-income products. \n\u25cf Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking \nincome, with declines in both MSR results and production.

This was partially offset by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. \ncredit card portfolio and a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off. \nNoninterest Expense \nNoninterest expense decreased $340 million to $54.7 billion for 2017 compared to \n2016.

Accounting Principles \nBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding \ncompany, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout \nthe U.S. and in certain international markets. The term \u201cthe Corporation\u201d as used \nherein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America \nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s \nsubsidiaries or affiliates. \nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and \nits majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the \nCorporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions \nhave been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included \nfrom the dates of acquisition and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation \nbecame the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are \nnot included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts \nfor investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has \nthe ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions \nusing the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other \nassets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the \nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income. \nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with \naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) \nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported \namounts and disclosures. Realized results could materially differ from those \nestimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to \nconform to current-period presentation. \nNew Accounting Standards \nEffective January 1, 2018, the Corporation adopted the following new accounting \nstandards on a prospective basis. \n\u25cf Revenue Recognition \u2013 The new accounting standard addresses the \nrecognition of revenue from contracts with customers. For additional information, \nsee Revenue Recognition Accounting Policies in this Note, and . \n\u25cf Hedge Accounting \u2013 The new accounting standard simplifies and expands the \nability to apply hedge accounting to certain risk management activities. For \nadditional information, see . \n\u25cf Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities \u2013 The \nnew accounting standard relates to the recognition and measurement of financial \ninstruments, including equity investments. For additional information, see and . \n\u25cf Tax Effects in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income \u2013 The new \naccounting standard addresses certain tax effects stranded in accumulated \nother comprehensive income (OCI) related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act \n(the Tax Act). For additional information, see . Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation adopted the following new accounting \nstandards on a retrospective basis, resulting in restatement of all prior periods \npresented in the Consolidated Statement of Income and the Consolidated \nStatement of Cash Flows. The changes in presentation are not material to the \nindividual line items affected. \n\u25cf Presentation of Pension Costs \u2013 The new accounting standard requires \nseparate presentation of the service cost component of pension expense from all \nother components of net pension benefit/cost in the Consolidated Statement of \nIncome. As a result, the service cost component continues to be presented in \npersonnel expense while other components of net pension benefit/cost (e.g., \ninterest cost, actual return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost) are \nnow presented in other general operating expense. For additional information, \nsee . \n\u25cf Classification of Cash Flows and Restricted Cash \u2013 The new accounting \nstandards address the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments \nin the statement of cash flows as well as the presentation and disclosure of \nrestricted cash. For more information on restricted cash, see . \nLease Accounting \nOn January 1, 2019, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standards that \nrequire lessees to recognize operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet \nas right-of-use assets and lease liabilities based on the value of the discounted \nfuture lease payments. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged.

Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Expanded \ndisclosures about the nature and terms of lease agreements will be required \nprospectively. The Corporation elected to apply certain transition elections which \nallow for the continued application of the previous determination of whether a \ncontract that existed at transition is or contains a lease, the associated lease \nclassification, and the recognition of leases on January 1, 2019 through a \ncumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, with no adjustment to \ncomparative prior periods presented. Upon adoption, the Corporation recognized \nright-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $9.7 billion. Adoption of the standard did \nnot have a significant effect on the Corporation\u2019s regulatory capital measures. \nAccounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Adopted \nAccounting for Financial Instruments -- Credit Losses \nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard that \nwill be effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020. The standard replaces the \nexisting measurement of the allowance for credit losses that is based on \nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Corporation\u2019s \nlending activities with management\u2019s best estimate of lifetime expected credit \nlosses inherent in the Corporation\u2019s financial assets that are recognized at \namortized cost. The standard will also expand credit quality disclosures. While the \nstandard changes the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, it does not \nchange the Corporation\u2019s credit risk of its lending portfolios. The credit loss \nestimation models and processes to be used in implementing the new standard \nhave largely been designed and developed. The validation of the models and \ntesting of controls are in process and expected to be completed during 2019. \nCurrently, the impact of this new accounting standard may be an increase in the \nCorporation\u2019s allowance for credit losses at the date of adoption which would have a \nresulting negative adjustment to retained earnings.

Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or \nusage by legal binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements. \nSecurities Financing Agreements \nSecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned \nor sold under agreements to repurchase (securities financing agreements) are \ntreated as collateralized financing transactions except in instances where the \ntransaction is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase \ntransactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at acquisition or sale price \nplus accrued interest, except for certain securities financing agreements that the \nCorporation accounts for under the fair value option. Changes in the fair value of \nsecurities financing agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option \nare recorded in trading account profits in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \nThe Corporation\u2019s policy is to monitor the market value of the principal amount \nloaned under resale agreements and obtain collateral from or return collateral \npledged to counterparties when appropriate. Securities financing agreements do not \ncreate material credit risk due to these collateral provisions; therefore, an allowance \nfor loan losses is not necessary. \nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending \nagreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it \nrecognizes an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing \nthe securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those \nsecurities. \nCollateral \nThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is permitted by \ncontract or practice to sell or repledge. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair \nvalue of this collateral was $599.0 billion and $561.9 billion, of which $508.6 billion \nand $476.1 billion were sold or repledged. The primary source of this collateral is \nsecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell. \nThe Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and loans as collateral \nin transactions that include repurchase agreements, securities loaned, public and \ntrust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and short-term borrowings. This \ncollateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties to \nthe transactions, is parenthetically disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \nIn certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to consolidated VIEs \nwhere those restricted assets serve as collateral for the interests issued by the \nVIEs. These assets are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Assets of \nConsolidated VIEs. \nIn addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative \ncontracts. Required collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the \ntype of counterparty. Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of \ncash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based on \nprovisions contained in master netting agreements, the \n93 Bank of America 2018 Corporation nets cash collateral received against derivative assets. The \nCorporation also pledges collateral on its own derivative positions which can be \napplied against derivative liabilities. \nTrading Instruments \nFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value \nis generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and \nliabilities. If these market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based \non dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar \ntechniques where the determination of fair value may require significant \nmanagement judgment or estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a \ntrade-date basis.

Derivatives used in risk management activities include \nderivatives that are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships \nand derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not designated \nin qualifying accounting hedge relationships (referred to as other risk management \nactivities). The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange \nrate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives. Derivatives utilized by \nthe Corporation include swaps, futures and forward settlement contracts, and option \ncontracts. \nAll derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, \ntaking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting \nagreements that allow the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and \noffset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-\ntraded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in active or inactive \nmarkets or is derived from observable market- based pricing parameters, similar to \nthose applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded \ncontracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash \nflow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value \nmay require significant management judgment or estimation. \nValuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument \nincluding counterparty credit risk.

Derivatives used in other risk management activities \nhave not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because \nthey did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is \nreported at fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative \ninstrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in \nthe Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective.

The changes in the fair value of \nthese derivatives are included in other income. \nDerivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges) \nFor accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at inception all \nrelationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk \nmanagement objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. \nAdditionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a \nhedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative \nused in an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly \neffective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or \nforecasted transaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is \ndetermined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly \neffective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in \nearnings after termination of the hedge relationship. \nFair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the \nCorporation\u2019s assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign \nexchange volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value \nhedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement line \nitem with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. If a derivative \ninstrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, \nthe previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are \nsubsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the \ncarrying value of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining \nlife of the respective asset or liability. \nCash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of \nassets and liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign \nexchange rate fluctuations. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash \nflow hedges are recorded in accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the line item \nin the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period \nthe hedged item affects earnings. Components of a derivative that are excluded in \nassessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income statement line \nitem as the hedged item. \nNet investment hedges are used to manage the foreign exchange rate sensitivity \narising from a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of \nderivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are \nrecorded as a component of accumulated OCI. The remaining components of these \nderivatives are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in \nother income. \nSecurities \nDebt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade date. \nTheir classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities were \nacquired.

In determining whether an impairment is other than \ntemporary, the Corporation considers the severity and duration of the decline in fair \nvalue, the length of time expected for recovery, the financial condition of the issuer, \nand other qualitative factors, as well as whether the Corporation either plans to sell \nthe security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security \nbefore recovery of the amortized cost. For AFS debt securities the Corporation \nintends to hold, an analysis is performed to determine how much of the decline in \nfair value is related to the issuer\u2019s credit and how much is related to market factors \n(e.g., interest rates). If any of the decline in fair value is due to credit, an other-than -\ntemporary impairment (OTTI) loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of \nIncome for that amount. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market \nfactors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the \ncredit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the difference is \ndue to market factors and is recognized as an unrealized gain in accumulated \nOCI. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will \nbe required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value as an OTTI loss. \nInterest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of \ndiscounts, is included in interest income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or \naccreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of \nthe securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are \ndetermined using the specific identification method. \nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for \ntrading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included \nin other income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values \nare held at cost and evaluated for impairment. These securities are reported in \nother assets or time deposits placed and other short-term investments. \nLoans and Leases \nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are \nmeasured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding principal balances net \nof any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on \noriginated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or \ndiscounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred \nand recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related \nloans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income \nusing a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain \nconsumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with changes in fair \nvalue reported in other income. \nUnder applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and \nlease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio \nsegment, by class of financing receivables.

The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. \ncommercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease \nfinancing and U.S. small business commercial. \nPurchased Credit-impaired Loans \nAt acquisition, purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans are recorded at fair value with \nno allowance for credit losses, and accounted for individually or aggregated in pools \nbased on similar risk characteristics. The expected cash flows in excess of the \namount paid for the loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is recorded as \ninterest income over the remaining estimated life of the loan or pool of loans. The \nexcess of the contractual principal and interest over the expected cash flows of the \nPCI loans is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. If, upon subsequent \nvaluation, the Corporation determines it is probable that the present value of the \nexpected cash flows has decreased, a charge to the provision for credit losses is \nrecorded. If it is probable that there is a significant increase in the present value of \nexpected cash flows, the allowance for credit losses is reduced or, if there is no \nremaining allowance for credit losses related to these PCI loans, the accretable \nyield is increased through a reclassification from nonaccretable difference, resulting \nin a prospective increase in interest income. Reclassifications to or from \nnonaccretable difference can also occur for changes in the estimated lives of the \nPCI loans. If a loan within a PCI pool is sold, foreclosed, forgiven or the expectation \nof any future proceeds is remote, the loan is removed from the pool at its \nproportional carrying value. If the loan\u2019s recovery value is less than its carrying \nvalue, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool\u2019s nonaccretable difference \nand then against the allowance for credit losses. \nLeases \nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of \nlease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease \npayments receivable plus estimated residual value of the leased property less \nunearned income. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases, are \nreported net of non-recourse debt. Unearned income on leveraged and direct \nfinancing leases is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods \nthat approximate the interest method. \nAllowance for Credit Losses \nThe allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease \nlosses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents \nmanagement\u2019s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the Corporation\u2019s loan \nand lease portfolio excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted \nfor under the fair value option. The allowance for credit losses includes both \nquantitative and qualitative components. The qualitative component has a higher \ndegree of management subjectivity, and includes factors such as concentrations, \neconomic conditions and other considerations.

The allowance on certain homogeneous consumer loan portfolios, which \ngenerally consist of consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real Estate \nportfolio segment and credit card loans within the Credit Card and Other Consumer \nportfolio segment, is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations generally \nby product type. Loss forecast models are utilized for these portfolios which \nconsider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, \nestimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, \nbankruptcies, economic conditions, credit scores and the amount of loss in the \nevent of default. \nFor consumer loans secured by residential real estate, using statistical modeling \nmethodologies, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default \nbased on the individual loan attributes aggregated into pools of homogeneous loans \nwith similar attributes. The attributes that are most significant to the probability of \ndefault and are used to estimate defaults include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, \nin the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit \nscore, months since origination (referred to as vintage) and geography, all of which \nare further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, \ndelinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). The severity or loss given default is \nestimated based on the refreshed LTV for first-lien mortgages or CLTV for \nsubordinated liens. The estimates are based on the Corporation\u2019s historical \nexperience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect an assessment of \nenvironmental factors not yet reflected in the historical data underlying the loss \nestimates, such as changes in real estate values, local and national economies, \nunderwriting standards and the regulatory environment. The probability of default \nmodels also incorporate recent experience with modification programs including re-\ndefaults subsequent to modification, a loan\u2019s default history prior to modification and \nthe change in borrower payments post-modification. On home equity loans where \nthe Corporation holds only a second-lien position and foreclosure is not the best \nalternative, the loss severity is estimated at 100 percent. \nThe allowance on certain commercial loans (except business card and certain \nsmall business loans) is calculated using loss rates delineated by risk rating and \nproduct type. Factors considered when assessing loss rates include the value of the \nunderlying collateral, if applicable, the industry of the obligor, and the obligor\u2019s \nliquidity and other financial indicators along with certain qualitative factors. These \nstatistical models are updated regularly for changes in economic and business \nconditions.

An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference \nto market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to \nthe Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In \nthe event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized \nindices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses \nappraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While \nthere is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they \nare representative of the portfolio in the aggregate. \nIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also \nestimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters \nof credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded \nlending commitments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and \nsegregated by risk according to the Corporation\u2019s internal risk rating scale. These \nrisk classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, \nutilization assumptions, current economic conditions, performance trends within the \nportfolio and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve \nfor unfunded lending commitments. \nThe allowance for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio is reported \nseparately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet whereas the reserve for unfunded \nlending commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued \nexpenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and \nlease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated \nStatement of Income. \nNonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies \nNonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been \nplaced on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI \nloans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming. \nIn accordance with the Corporation\u2019s policies, consumer real estate-secured \nloans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed \non nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless \nrepayment of the loan is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or \nthrough individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae \n(FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio).

Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to \namortization. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible \nasset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value. \nVariable Interest Entities \nA VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have \na controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The \nCorporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the \nVIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and an \nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be \nsignificant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its \ninvolvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing \ndocuments and its financial interests in the VIE. The consolidation status of the \nVIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change as a result of such \nreassessments. \nThe Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the \nCorporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle. \nWhen the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust, \nincluding non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and \nother loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of \nthe trust.

The \nCorporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it has the power to \ndirect the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the trust or \nhas other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and \nwarranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust. \nThe Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and AFS securities \ninto municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation consolidates a \nmunicipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of \nthe trust such as the remarketing of the trust\u2019s liabilities or, if there are no ongoing \nactivities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of \nsecurities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also \nretains securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be \nsignificant to the trust.

The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs \nand, therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most \nsignificantly impact the economic performance of a CDO.

The Corporation does not \nconsolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial design of \nthe vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not \nhave a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle. \nRetained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value. In \naddition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued by unconsolidated \nVIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as trading account \nassets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily \non quoted market prices in active or inactive markets.

Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the \nuse of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring \nfair value. A hierarchy is established which categorizes fair value measurements \ninto three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest \npriority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority \ngiven to unobservable inputs.

Level 2 \nassets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are \ntraded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative \ncontracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs \nthat are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or \ncorroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes \nU.S. government and agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed \nsecurities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative contracts, certain \nloans and LHFS. \nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and \nthat are significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level \n3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the \ndetermination of fair value requires significant management judgment or \nestimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally \ndetermined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or \nsimilar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant \nwould use in pricing the asset or liability.

Current \nincome tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. \nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and \nliabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent \ndecreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future \nreversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured \nby tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax \nassets are also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss \ncarryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to \nreduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely \nthan not to be realized. \nIncome tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step \nmodel: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely \non its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is \nmeasured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than not to \nbe sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and \nthe tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. \nThe Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, \nwithin income tax expense. \nBank of America 2018 98", "start_char_idx": 4659, "end_char_idx": 8625, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87e4297c-c921-4617-ac34-3da663e11e0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "87e4297c-c921-4617-ac34-3da663e11e0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e088b482-7855-4182-b751-756233528c74", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6bed397edd081abb3f6c5cec545232538cc62c4244113775add6b3e7754b6654", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7daf8721-b7e3-41e5-a048-54ebb26b1ae5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "4e95ffcda861b9f9536ec680aae0983e0106a31649b8b29821966237cb49a1ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd8d236a-68db-4c8e-be2e-5e9f74dc3264", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d33ea00ced354141a43b3d383ae6cc6614dc5f4e4b861b5c3b69c586b38d32b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fd679d13ffd8e6f485b9d48a96f3569d9cda5ceeda1bf2d4fcda2d65fab743fc", "text": "Revenue Recognition \nThe following summarizes the Corporation\u2019s revenue recognition accounting \npolicies for certain noninterest income activities. \nCard Income \nCard income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as fees earned from \ninterchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous transactions and is presented \nnet of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit \nand debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage \nbasis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding \npayment network\u2019s rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the \ntransaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are \nrecognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders that are estimated to be \nuncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Included in \ndirect cost are rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to \ncardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed \nfor a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards. The points to be \nredeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type, \naccount transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability is \nreduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to \ncredit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that \nare generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part \nof the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner provides the \nCorporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card partner\u2019s members or \ncustomers on behalf of the Corporation. \nService Charges \nService charges include deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related fees \nconsist of fees earned on consumer and commercial \ndeposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as \nthe service is performed. Consumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts \nfor account maintenance and various transaction-based services, such as ATM \ntransactions, wire transfer activities, check and money order processing and \ninsufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial deposit-related fees are from \nthe Corporation\u2019s Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial \ndeposit and treasury management services, including account maintenance and \nother services, such as payroll, sweep account and other cash management \nservices. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from \ncertain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs. \nInvestment and Brokerage Services \nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage \nfees. Asset management fees are earned from the management of client assets \nunder advisory agreements or the full discretion of the Corporation\u2019s financial \nadvisors (collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)). Asset \nmanagement fees are earned as a percentage of the client\u2019s AUM and generally \nrange from 50 basis points (bps) to150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third \nparty is used to obtain a client\u2019s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third \nparty is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation \nis an agent for those services. \nBrokerage fees include income earned from transaction-based services that are \nperformed as part of investment management services and are based on a fixed \nprice per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees \nalso include distribution fees and sales commissions that are primarily in the \n99 Bank of America 2018 Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM ) segment and are earned over \ntime. In addition, primarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage fees are \nearned when the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial \nproducts or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears transactions and/or \nsubmits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker. Certain customers pay \nbrokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory bodies or \nexchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are \nnot reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those \nservices. \nInvestment Banking Income \nInvestment banking income includes underwriting income and financial advisory \nservices income.

These expenses are recovered through \nthe revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating \nexpenses.

Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and \ncredit contracts are utilized in the Corporation\u2019s ALM and risk management \nactivities. \nThe Corporation maintains  an overall interest rate risk management strategy \nthat incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-\nleveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to \nminim ize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The \nCorporation\u2019s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that \nmovements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. \nAs a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities \nappreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivati ve instruments \nthat are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to \nsubstantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation. \nMarket risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage \nbusiness. Market risk in the mortgage business is the risk that values of mortgage \nassets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such \nas interest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking \nproduction income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and \nother derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt \nsecurities. The \n103 Bank of America 2018 Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate \nswaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market \nrisks of MSRs. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value \nMeasurements . \nThe Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign \nexchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and \nliabilities, as well as the Corporation\u2019s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign \nexchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent \nagreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another \ncountry at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to \nloss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as \ncurrency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. \nThe Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk related to \ncertain funded and unfunded credit expos ures. Credit derivatives include CDS, total \nreturn swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated \nBalance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income. \nDerivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges \nThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative \ncontracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due \nto fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The \nCorporation also uses these types of contracts to protect against changes in the \ncash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow \nhedges).

However, the Corporation does not monitor \nits exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this \nmeasure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, \nthe notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these \ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish \nlimits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined \nlimits. \nCredit-related notes in the table above include investments in securities issued \nby CDO, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These \ninstruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of \nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss. The \nCorporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of \nthe securities owned. Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral \nThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market \nwith large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a \nlesser degree, with a variety of non-financial companies. A significant majority of the \nderivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events \nsuch as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a \nbreach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of \ncollateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the \nCorporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all \ntrades. Further, as previously discussed on page 102, the Corporation enters into \nlegally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting \ncloseout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the \noccurrence of certain events. \nBank of America 2018 106", "start_char_idx": 292, "end_char_idx": 2318, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbb3190b-cba2-4246-8190-bbe5c7f583a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbb3190b-cba2-4246-8190-bbe5c7f583a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "793378d3-3b06-4b87-a919-bbdaf6fff5ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "c553c829cf17244be322930b5c1a8efe19f4a508b76308af8a7351e63996d35a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c51e8cbf-c760-4522-a299-545a9fc16361", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "59cc390d60a131ece51b654a53d44e81d32abf4c78716ba1fc151ae05faccc8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0721edcb-5312-45c0-8aea-01d9230af7a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8079d9555763b9245d1907a9d26628339c77783cc4a5ea8fa27241df8b18ec6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d1da9d88a3b817dc11337eaf47ac641d72d83f8d495bd84ca357af98efc062b8", "text": "A majority of the Corporation\u2019s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related \ncontingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and \ncredit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these \ninstruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom \nthe Corporation has transacted.

CDS spread data is used to estimate the default \nprobabilities and severities that are applied to the exposures. Where no observable \ncredit default data is available for counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and \nother market data to estimate default probabilities and severity. \nValuation adjustments on derivatives are affected by changes in market \nspreads, non-credit related market factors such as interest rate and currency \nchanges that affect the expected exposure, and other factors like changes in \ncollateral arrangements and partial payments. Credit spreads and non-credit factors \ncan move independently. For example, for an interest rate swap, changes in \ninterest rates may increase the expected exposure, which would increase the \ncounterparty credit valuation adjustment (CVA). Independently, counterparty credit \nspreads may tighten, which would result in an offsetting decrease to CVA. \nThe Corporation enters into risk management activities to offset market driven \nexposures. The Corporation often hedges the counterparty spread risk in CVA with \nCDS. The Corporation hedges other market risks in both CVA and DVA primarily \nwith currency and interest rate swaps. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge \namounts in the table below move in the same direction as the gross amount or may \nmove in the opposite direction. This movement is a consequence of the complex \ninteraction of the risks being hedged, resulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly \nhedge all of the market exposures at all times. \nThe table below presents CVA, DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives, \nwhich are recorded in trading account profits, on a gross and net of hedge basis for \n2018, 2017 and 2016.

OTTI losses on AFS debt securities which \nwere recognized in other income. The amount of noncredit-related OTTI losses \nrecognized in OCI was not significant for all periods presented. \nThe cumulative OTTI credit losses recognized in income on AFS debt securities \nthat the Corporation does not intend to sell were $120 million, $274 million and $253 \nmillion at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nThe Corporation estimates the portion of a loss on a security that is attributable \nto credit using a discounted cash flow model and estimates the expected cash \nflows of the underlying collateral using internal credit, interest rate and prepayment \nrisk models that incorporate management\u2019 s best estimate of current key \nassumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. \nAssumptions used for the underlying loans that support the MBS can vary widely \nfrom loan to loan and are influenced by such factors as loan interest rate, \ngeographic location of the borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. \nBased on these assumptions, the Corporation then determines how the underlying \ncollateral cash flows will be distributed to each MBS issued from the applicable \nspecial purpose entity. Expected principal and interest cash flows on an impaired \nAFS debt security are discounted using the effective yield of each individual \nimpaired AFS debt security. \nSignificant assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows for \nmeasuring credit losses on non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities \n(RMBS) were as follows at December 31, 2018. Significant Assumptions \nRange (1) \nWeighted \naverage 10th \nPercentile (2) 90th \nPercentile (2) \nPrepayment speed 12.9 % 3.3 % 21.5 % \nLoss severity 19.8 8.5 36.4 \nLife default rate 16.9 1.4 64.4 \n(1) Represents the range of inputs/assumptions based upon the underlying \ncollateral. \n(2) The value of a variable below which the indicated percentile of observations will \nfall. \nAnnual constant prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected \nconsidering collateral characteristics such as LTV, creditworthiness of borrowers as \nmeasured using Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and geographic \nconcentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type was 16.0 percent \nfor prime, 16.6 percent for Alt-A and 25.6 percent for subprime at December 31, \n2018. Default rates are projected by considering collateral characteristics including, \nbut not limited to, LTV, FICO and geographic concentration. Weighted-average life \ndefault rates by collateral type were 14.7 percent for prime, 16.6 percent for Alt-A \nand 19.1 percent for subprime at December 31, 2018. \nThe remaining contractual maturity distribution and yields of the Corporation\u2019s \ndebt securities carried at fair value and HTM debt securities at December 31, 2018 \nare summarized in the table below.

For more information, see Note 1 \n\u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . \nConsumer Real Estate \nImpaired consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio \nsegment consist entirely of TDRs. Excluding PCI loans, most modifications of \nconsumer real estate loans meet the definition of TDRs when a binding offer is \nextended to a borrower. Modifications of consumer real estate loans are done in \naccordance with government programs or the Corporation\u2019s proprietary programs. \nThese modifications are considered to be TDRs if concessions have been granted \nto borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Concessions may include reductions \nin interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest \nforbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or \ncombinations thereof. \nPrior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial \nmodifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary \nprograms. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period \nduring which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified \npayment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and \nthe borrower enter into a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are \nclassified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as \nTDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification. \nConsumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nwith no change in repayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower of $858 \nmillion were included in TDRs at December 31, 2018, of which $185 million were \nclassified as nonperforming and $344 million were loans fully insured by the FHA. \nFor more information on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see \nNonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note. \nConsumer real estate TDRs are measured primarily based on the net present \nvalue of the estimated cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s original effective interest \nrate. If the carrying value of a TDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is \nrecorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Alternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered to be dependent \nsolely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due to the lack of income verification) \nare measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral and a charge-off is \nrecorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral. Consumer real \nestate loans that reached 180 days past due prior to modification had been charged \noff to their net realizable value, less costs to sell, before they were modified as \nTDRs in accordance with established policy. Therefore, modifications of consumer \nreal estate loans that are 180 or more days past due as TDRs do not have an \nimpact on the allowance for loan and lease losses nor are additional charge-offs \nrequired at the time of modification. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the \ncollateral after a loan has reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. \nFully-insured loans are protected against principal loss, and therefore, the \nCorporation does not record an allowance for loan and lease losses on the \noutstanding principal balance, even after they have been modified in a TDR. \nA t December 31, 2018 and 2017, remaining commitments to lend additional \nfunds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR \nwere not significant. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $244 \nmillion and $236 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The carrying value of \nconsumer real estate loans, including fully-insured and PCI loans, for which formal \nforeclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2018 was $2.5 billion. \nDuring 2018 and 2017, the Corporation reclassified $670 million and $815 million of \nconsumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon \nforeclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), \nto other assets.", "start_char_idx": 767, "end_char_idx": 5173, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c23f38d-a404-492b-9920-76809276f7e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c23f38d-a404-492b-9920-76809276f7e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bf4d6a6b-48f3-432f-8ab0-e831c0dd8cc4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "f09b20d66788836687bd7b58ba2bbabc44ab67c46ad71d15405f365a7df5b11e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a9a6c15-a615-4f50-9799-044a9c2823d0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "401afb61a9566336a1ff3a26cc4a808743be0c4d2d3d05171695f6c0bd2b0b7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bca3fc00-8fe2-4403-becf-2b0c234e4412", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2db96dface508c037c2f5ae879e783d12e11b6dcdb7c7cbf73069bcf8b799888", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9967412c49cfb269a00429498339a4fc9fe9b27836a5b5b37ee436d132761bb6", "text": "A t December 31, 2018 and 2017, remaining commitments to lend additional \nfunds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR \nwere not significant.

the second of two consecutive \npayments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting \nfuture cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for \nimpaired credit card and other consumer loans. Based on historical experience, the \nCorporation estimates that 13 percent of new U.S. credit card TDRs and14 percent \nof new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months \nafter modification. \nCommercial Loans \nImpaired commercial loans include nonperforming loans and TDRs (both \nperforming and nonperforming). Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that \nare experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation\u2019s loss \nexposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial \ndifficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and \nreflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a \nTDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of \ninterest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the customer \nwhile mitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk exposure. Reductions in interest rates are \nrare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate \nmay not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, \nshort sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan. \nAt the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if \nany, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms. If there was no \nforgiveness of principal and the interest rate was not decreased, the modification \nmay have little or no impact on the allowance established for the loan. If a portion of \nthe loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge -off may be recorded at the time of \nrestructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a \nprevious period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification. For \nmore information on modifications for the U.S. small business commercial portfolio, \nsee Credit Card and Other Consumer in this Note. \nA t December 31, 2018 and 2017, remaining commitments to lend additional \nfunds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a commercial loan TDR were \n$297 million and $205 million. \nThe table below provides information on impaired loans in the Commercial loan \nportfolio segment including the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related \nallowance at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the average carrying value for \n2018, 2017 and 2016.

The Corporation routinely \nsecuritizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the \nCorporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt \nsecurities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other \nsecuritization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of \nthe Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can \nonly be used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The \nCorporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, \ninvestment vehicles and other entities. For more information on the Corporation\u2019s \nuse of VIEs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . \n123 Bank of America 2018 The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and \nunconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2018 and 2017 in situations where the \nCorporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation \notherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present the \nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure at December 31, 2018 and 2017 resulting \nfrom its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the \nCorporation holds a variable interest. The Corporatio n\u2019s maximum loss exposure is \nbased on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and \nincorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance \nsheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual \narrangements.

In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs such as trust \npreferr ed securities trusts in connection with its funding activities. In 2018, the \nCorporation redeemed trust preferred securities with a total carrying value of $3.1 \nbillion resulting in the extinguishment of the related junior subordinated notes \nissued by the Corporation. In connection therewith, the Corporation recorded a \ncharge to other income of $729 million primarily due to the difference between the \ncarrying and redemption values of the trust preferred securities, the majority of \nwhich relates to the discount on the junior subordinated notes resulting from prior \nacquisitions. For more information on trust preferred securities, see Note 11 \u2013 \nLong-term Debt.

Securitization usually occurs in \nconjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may \nalso securitize loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the \nCorporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or \npurchases from other entities. The Corporation typic ally services the loans it \nsecuritizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the \nsecuritization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches \nissued by the trusts. Except as described in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and \nContingencies , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the \nsecuritization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. \nThe table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage \nsecuritizations for 2018, 2017 and 2016. \nFirst-lien Mortgage Securitizations \n(Dollars in millions) \nCash proceeds from new securitizations (1) \nGains on securitizations (2) \nRepurchases from securitization trusts (3) $ Residential Mortgage - Agency \n2018 2017 \n5,369 $ 14,467 $ \n62 158 \n1,485 2,713 2016 \n24,201 \n370 \n3,611 $ 2018 \n6,713 \n101 \n\u2014 Commercial Mortgage \n2017 \n$ 5,641 \n91 \n\u2014 $ 2016 \n3,887 \n38 \n\u2014 \n(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and receives RMBS in exchange which may then be sold into the market to third-party investors for cash \nproceeds. \n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option.", "start_char_idx": 967, "end_char_idx": 4747, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5364aec2-7723-4e72-8c1c-3e4bd2d8cf94": {"__data__": {"id_": "5364aec2-7723-4e72-8c1c-3e4bd2d8cf94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14c9235f-eef3-4410-af53-a67956aa4c60", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "cf230a877f70f1a88bef23fa713174177f84354656a388e96a427bfdbe9b5e3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f154d69d-8d39-45e4-a6e9-ef7e997d1fdd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "0f11285dd10a17a1fabb6aed58b9b5780e00fa415960dada98b9bc526dea4301", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa65b042-69d3-42a6-aa16-0bd5f42b1a0c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "05fd2784afdfb556d078d97206e8f0f9b8605ab24a0c8439e660f22a7713870f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "758b488710443d2aa8005c615374eab1d5c2512e73b9b34feca699826e7e1fcc", "text": "(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option.

In addition, the \nCorporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a \nrapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure \nin the table above. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the \nrapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines \nof credit (HELOCs), performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and \nthe timing of related cash flows. \nCredit Card Securitizations \nThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The \nCorporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing \nthe receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller\u2019s interest) in the receivables, \nand holding certain retained interests including subordinate interests in accrued \ninterest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts. \nDuring 2018, 2017 and 2016, new senior debt securities issued to third-party \ninvestors from the credit card securitization trust were $4.0 billion, $3.1 billion and \n$750 million, respectively. \nA t December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation held subordinate securities \nissued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $7.7 \nbillion and $7.4 billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to \nthe senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. During \n2018, 2017 and 2016, the credit card securitization trust issued$650 million, $500 \nmillion and $121 million, respectively, of these subordinate securities. \nResecuritization Trusts \nThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs at the \nrequest of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing \nactivities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the \nunilateral ability to liquidate the trust. \nThe Corporation resecuritized $22.8 billion, $25.1 billion and $23.4 billion of \nsecurities in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Securities transferred into \nresecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value \nrecorded in trading account profits prior to the resecuritization and no gain or loss \non sale was recorded. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, resecuritization proceeds \nincluded securities with an initial fair value of $4.1 billion, $3.3 billion and $3.3 \nbillion, respectively. Substantially all of the other securities received as \nresecuritization proceeds were classified as trading securities and were categorized \nas Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. \nMunicipal Bond Trusts \nThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, \nfixed-rate municipal bonds.

The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure associated with \nboth consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $7.2 billion and $5.7 \nbillion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet \nassets less non-recourse liabilities. \nLeveraged Lease Trusts \nThe Corporation\u2019s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled \n$1.8 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing \nmember and has control over the significant activities of the VIE.

The Corporation\u2019s risk of loss is \ngenerally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax \ncredits prior to making its investment. \nThe Corporation\u2019s investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are \nreported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $8.9 billion and \n$8.0 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of$3.8 \nbillion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The unfunded commitments \nare expected to be paid over the next five years. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the \nCorporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits from investments in \naffordable housing partnerships of $981 million, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion and \nreported pretax losses in other income of $798 million, $766 million and $789 \nmillion, respectively. Tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation\u2019s annual \neffective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter.

This commitment extends through November \n2022 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice. \nThe Corporation is a party to operating leases for certain of its premises and \nequipment.

The \nindemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into \nin the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss \nwould be remote. These agreements typically contain an early termination clause \nthat permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The \nmaximum potential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to \nassess for several reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the \ninability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining \nhow such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposur e limits \ncontained in standard contract language and the timing of any early termination \nclauses. Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de \nminimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in \nthe future as remote. \nMerchant Services \nIn accordance with credit and debit card association rules, the Corporation \nsponsors merchant processing servicers that process credit and debit card \ntransactions on behalf of various merchants. If the merchant processor fails to meet \nits obligation to reimburse the cardholder for disputed transactions, then the \nCorporation, as the sponsor, could be held liable for the disputed amount. In 2018 \nand 2017, the sponsored entities processed and settled $874.3 billion and $812.2 \nbillion of transactions and recorded losses of$31 million and $28 million.

However, the Corporation \nbelieves that the maximum potential exposure is not representative of the actual \npotential loss exposure and does not expect to make material payments in \nconnection with these guarantees. \nExchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees \nThe Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and \nclearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, the Corporation \nmay be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these \norganizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. \nThe Corporation\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests \nin such exchanges and clearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the \nCorporation\u2019s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited instances, to the full \npro-rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund.

Under these arrangements, the \nCorporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to \nsecurities transactions. The Corporation\u2019s obligations in this respect are secured by \nthe assets in the clients\u2019 accounts and the accounts of their customers as well as by \nany proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the firm on \nbehalf of clients or their customers. The Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure \nunder these arrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the \nCorporation to incur material losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote. \nOther Guarantees \nThe Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and \ncommitments, including sold risk participation swaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end \nobligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint \nventure guarantees, divested business commitments and sold put options that \nrequire gross settlement. The maximum potential future payment under these \nagreements was approximately $5.9 billion at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. \nThe estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2040. The \nCorporation has made no material payments under these guarantees.

In addition, \nin prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien \nresidential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or \nin the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or \ncertain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies make and have made various \nrepresentations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties \nhave resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase \nmortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide indemnification or other \nremedies to sponsors, investors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other \nparties (collectively, repurchases). \nUnresolved Repurchase Claims \nUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the \nnotional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the \noutstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. \nIn the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater \nthan the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, \nmortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments.

The Corporation has combined the range of \nreasonably possible losses that are in excess of the representations and warranties \nreserve with the litigation range of possible loss in excess of litigation reserves, as \ndiscussed in Litigation and Regulatory Matters in this Note. This is consistent with \nthe reduction in outstanding representations and warranties exposure in \ncomparison to prior periods resulting from the resolution of prior matters along with \nchanges in the Corporation\u2019s business model. \nThe reserve for representations and warranties exposures does not consider \ncertain losses related to servicing, including foreclosure and related costs, fraud, \nindemnity, or claims (including for RMBS) related to securities law or monoline \ninsurance litigation. Losses with respect to one or more of these matters could be \nmaterial to the Corporation\u2019s results of operations or liquidity for any particular \nreporting period. \nLitigation and Regulatory Matters \nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely \ndefendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and \ngovernmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting \nthe outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or \nindeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve \na large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual \noutcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, \nor eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter. \nIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes \nan accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both \nprobable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess \nof any amounts accrued. As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with \nany outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether \nsuch matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. Once the \nloss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will \nestablish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related \nexpense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments \nthat could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously \nestablished. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, \nlitigation-related expense of $469 million and $753 million was recognized in 2018 \nand 2017. \nFor a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note for which a loss, \nwhether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, \nis reasonably possible in future periods, the Corporation is able to estimate a range \nof possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to estimate a range of possible \nloss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its matters on an ongoing basis, in \nconjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially \nrelevant factual and legal developments. With respect to the matters disclosed in \nthis Note, in cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate \ninformation to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and \ndisclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable \nor reasonably possible but \n135 Bank of America 2018 such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible.

Countrywide I \nThe Corporation, Countrywide and other Countrywide entities are named as \ndefendants in an action filed on September 28, 2010 in New York Supreme Court. \nAmbac asserts claims for fraudulent inducement as well as breach of contract and \nseeks damages in excess of $2.2 billion, plus punitive damages. \nOn May 16, 2017, the First Department issued its decisions on the parties\u2019 \ncross-appeals of the trial court\u2019s October 22, 2015 summary judgment rulings. \nAmbac appealed the First Department\u2019s rulings requiring Ambac to prove all of the \nelements of its fraudulent inducement claim, including justifiable reliance and loss \ncausation; restricting Ambac\u2019s sole remedy for its breach of contract claims to the \nrepurchase protocol of cure, repurchase or substitution of any materially defective \nloan; and dismissing Ambac\u2019s claim for reimbursements of attorneys\u2019 fees.

Countrywide II \nOn December 30, 2014, Ambac filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court \nagainst the same defendants, claiming fraudulent inducement against Countrywide, \nand successor and vicarious liability against the Corporation. Ambac seeks \ndamages in excess of $600 million, plus punitive damages. On December 19, 2016, \nthe Court granted in part and denied in part Countrywide\u2019s motion to dismiss the \ncomplaint. \nAmbac v. Countrywide IV \nOn July 21, 2015, Ambac filed an action in New York Supreme Court against \nCountrywide asserting the same claims for fraudulent inducement that Ambac \nasserted in the now-dismissed Ambac v. Countrywide III. The complaint seeks \ndamages in excess of $350 million, plus punitive damages. \nAmbac v. First Franklin \nOn April 16, 2012, Ambac filed an action against BANA, First Franklin and various \nMerrill Lynch entities, including Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated \n(MLPF&S), in New York Supreme Court relating to guaranty insurance Ambac \nprovided on a First Franklin securitization sponsored by Merrill Lynch. The \ncomplaint alleges fraudulent inducement and breach of contract, including breach of \ncontract claims against BANA based upon its servicing of the loans in the \nsecuritization. Ambac seeks as damages hundreds of millions of dollars that Ambac \nalleges it has paid or will pay in claims. \nDeposit Insurance Assessment \nOn January 9, 2017, the FDIC filed suit against BANA in U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia alleging failure to pay a December 15, 2016 invoice for \nadditional deposit insurance assessments and interest in the amount of $542 million \nfor the quarters ending June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014. On April 7, \n2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a claim for additional deposit \ninsurance and interest in the amount of $583 million for the quarters ending March \n31, 2012 through March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on \nBANA\u2019s alleged underreporting of counterparty exposures that resulted in \nunderpayment of assessments for those quarters. BANA disagrees with the FDIC\u2019s \ninterpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time period and \nis defending itself against the FDIC\u2019s claims. Pending final resolution, BANA has \npledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional \nassessment amounts. \nOn March 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied \nBANA\u2019s partial motion to dismiss certain of the FDIC\u2019s claims. \nInterchange and Related Litigation \nIn 2005, a group of merchants filed a series of putative class actions and individual \nactions directed at interchange fees associated with Visa and MasterCard payment \ncard transactions. These actions, which were consolidated in the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of New York under the caption In re Payment Card \nInterchange Fee and Merchant Discount Anti-Trust Litigation (Interchange), named \nVisa, MasterCard and several banks and bank holding companies, including the \nCorporation, as defendants. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants conspired to fix the \nlevel of default interchange rates and that certain rules of Visa and MasterCard were \nunreasonable restraints of trade. Plaintiffs sought compensatory and treble \ndamages and injunctive relief. \nOn October 19, 2012, defendants reached a settlement with respect to the \nputative class actions that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected. \nIn 2018, defendants reached a settlement with the representatives of the putative Rule 23(b)(3) damages class to \ncontribute an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion held in escrow \nfrom the prior settlement.

In addition, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had cash deposited with \nclearing organizations of $8.1 billion and $11.9 billion primarily recorded in other \nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \nBank Subsidiary Distributions \nThe primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the Corporation to its \nshareholders are capital distributions received from its bank subsidiaries, BANA and \nBank of America California, N.A. In 2018, the Corporation received dividends of \n$26.1 billion from BANA and $320 million from Bank of America California, N.A. In \naddition, Bank of America California, N.A. returned capital of $1.4 billion to the \nCorporation in 2018. \nThe amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year \nwithout OCC approval is the subsidiary bank\u2019s net profits for that year combined \nwith its retained net profits for the preceding two years. Retained net profits, as \ndefined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the \nperiod. In 2019, BANA can declare and pay dividends of approximately$3.1 billion \nto the Corporation plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for \n2019 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. Bank of America California, \nN.A. can pay dividends of $40 million in 2019 plus an additional amount equal to its \nretained net profits for 2019 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. \nBank of America 2018 142", "start_char_idx": 2769, "end_char_idx": 6345, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52669c1c-73c1-435b-8ee6-29ce4a947485": {"__data__": {"id_": "52669c1c-73c1-435b-8ee6-29ce4a947485", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66c0f46e-5728-4619-940c-1433e93ef549", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "71e29c673b319b8ad532baa898bafd3430d8a4b728b5163c492c617d43ea66b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a868aaa2-bca3-4882-b458-204a347f34a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "242f8cc5eb78e156b11a4e4bdf838ddd001ce1eae2e1df0a9305c25038da8f49", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95fbee18-56d1-4437-ac10-576b84d2c438", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3392d2c2a5e97ba3f6f8a367e5b9e380aadefe24e53a79725bf72214b7ee5cf7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "aec890f822e59d2f899f4381817a5e1bbbbbab6cacf43eeb1b56a703537120c7", "text": "NOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans \nPension and Postretirement Plans \nThe Corporation sponsors a qualified noncontributory trusteed pension plan \n(Qualified Pension Plan), a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans, \nand postretirement health and life plans that cover eligible employees. Non-U.S. \npension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the country and local \npractices. \nThe Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account \nbalances with participant-selected investments, applied at the time a benefit \npayment is made from the plan that effectively provides principal protection for \nparticipant balances transferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation \nis responsible for funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature. \nBenefits earned under the Qualified Pens ion Plan have been frozen. Thereafter, \nthe cash balance accounts continue to earn investment credits or interest credits in \naccordance with the terms of the plan document. \nThe Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the payment of benefits \nvested under a terminated U.S. pension plan (Other Pension Plan). The \nCorporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for, or benefit \nfrom actual experience and investment performance of the annuity assets. The \nCorporation made no contribution under this agreement in2018 or 2017. \nContributions may be required in the future under this agreement. \nThe Corporation\u2019s noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans are unfunded and \nprovide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees. In addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefits-eligible employees \nmay become eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or life \ninsurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. These plans are referred to as the \nPostretirement Health and Life Plans. During 2017, the Corporation established and \nfunded a Voluntary Employees\u2019 Beneficiary Association trust in the amount of $300 \nmillion for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. \nThe Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the changes in the fair \nvalue of plan assets, changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded \nstatus of both the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the \nweighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the \npension plans and postretirement plans at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The \nestimate of the Corporation\u2019s PBO associated with these plans considers various \nactuarial assumptions, including assumptions for mortality rates and discount rates. \nThe discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique \nthat utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that \nmatch estimated benefit payments of each of the plans. The increases in the \nweighted-average discount rates in 2018 resulted in decreases to the PBO of \napproximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2018. The decreases in the weighted-\naverage discount rates in 2017 resulted in increases to the PBO of approximately \n$1.1 billion at December 31, 2017. Significant gains and losses related to changes \nin the PBO for 2018 and 2017 primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate. \nPension and Postretirement Plans (1) \nQualified \nPension Plan

The Corporation\u2019s policy is to invest the trust assets in \na prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and \ndefraying reasonable expenses of administration. The Corpor ation\u2019s investment \nstrategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the \nratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts to maximize the investment return \non assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying \nwith ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy \nutilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant for establishing the risk/return \nprofile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically reviewed \nand adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and \npassive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile \nof the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk \n(part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-\nselected investment measures. \nThe assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a U.K. \npension plan. This U.K. pension plan\u2019s assets are invested prudently so that the \nbenefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the nature \nand the duration of the plan\u2019s liabilities.

The RSUs were authorized to settle \npredominantly in shares of common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will be \nsettled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these awards to \nvariable accounting whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based \non changes in the share price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock up to the \nsettlement date.

Additionally, eight million of the RSUs granted in \n2018 will vest in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the \ngrant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the \nCorporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, \nnet of estimated forfeitures, based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. \nAwards granted in years prior to 2016 were predominantly cash settled. \nEffective October 1, 2017, the Corporation changed its accounting method for \ndetermining when stock-based compensation awards granted to retirement-eligible \nemployees are deemed authorized, changing from the grant date to the beginning \nof the year preceding the grant date when the incentive award plans are generally \napproved. As a result, the estimated value of the awards is expensed ratably over \nthe year preceding the grant date.

In addition, prior to 2017, total income tax expense did not \nreflect tax effects associated with the Corporation\u2019s employee stock plans which \ndecreased common stock and additional paid-in capital $41 million in 2016. \nIncome tax expense for2018, 2017 and 2016 varied from the amount computed \nby applying the statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes. The \nCorporation\u2019s federal statutory tax rate was 21 percent for 2018 and 35 percent for \n2017 and 2016. A reconciliation of the expected U.S. federal income tax expense, \ncalculated by applying the federal statutory tax rate, to the Corporation\u2019s actual \nincome tax expense, and the effective tax rates for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are \npresented in the table below. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Act which made \nsignificant changes to federal income tax law including, among other things, \nreducing the statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and \nchanging the taxation of the Corporation\u2019s non-U.S. business activities. The impact \non net income in 2017 was $2.9 billion, driven by $2.3 billion in income tax \nexpense, largely from a lower valuation of certain U.S. deferred tax assets and \nliabilities. The change in the statutory tax rate also impacted the Corporation \u2019s tax-\nadvantaged energy investments, resulting in a downward valuation adjustment of \n$946 million recorded in other income and a related income tax benefit of$347 \nmillion, which when netted against the $2.3 billion, resulted in a net impact on \nincome tax expense of $1.9 billion.

The \nCorporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable \naccounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable \ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes \nits financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value \nhierarchy. The Corporation conducts a review of its fair value hierarchy \nclassifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy \nclassifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models \nmeasuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or \nobservable in the current marketplace. For more information regarding the fair \nvalue hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 \u2013 \nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation accounts for certain \nfinancial instruments under the fair value option. For additional information, see \nNote 21 \u2013 Fair Value Option . \nValuation Techniques \nThe following sections outline the valuation methodologies for the Corporation\u2019s \nassets and liabilities. While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are \nappropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different \nmethodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial \ninstruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. \nDuring 2018, there were no changes to valuation approaches or techniques that \nhad, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated \nfinancial position or results of operations. \nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities \nThe fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on \nactively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or \nobserved transactions. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on \nquoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant \nfactor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and liabilities \nand debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some \npositions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed \nsignificantly or ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted \ncash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit \nrisk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management\u2019s best \nestimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and \nprepayment \nBank of America 2018 150", "start_char_idx": 3480, "end_char_idx": 7457, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ef74705-c404-42fe-9611-b614828b19a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ef74705-c404-42fe-9611-b614828b19a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75451393-ff77-4120-bbfe-d8db62e66438", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5cdb18f8160daa3085a2c2a160442c52772e61b1ba3c32b6adf8507b03eb2bf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a408976e-66c1-4ab8-abfd-9067004a0c38", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5d1025e6da9010326ebd56fa21071866f946e2ea2c3cfa33dd039086c357239d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "813d9114-d857-4209-89bb-7bf2e3a38777", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5051190f8d102441946578eeefbcae6cc88d07add17e96816fa1f2e03a8aa468", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b76949fe74944f03f08819ef125180450f11b1597da76c560bf12c6a44fed89f", "text": "rates.

Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market\u2019s perception of \ncredit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these \ninstances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information \nand other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer\u2019s financial statements and \nchanges in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies. \nDerivative Assets and Liabilities \nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are \ndetermined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including \ninterest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and \nvolatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively \nquoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market \ntransactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are \nused, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation \nrisk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based \nor have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily \navailable, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of \nrate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of \nderivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty \ncredit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, \nthe Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives \na valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. \nPositions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is \nadjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is \nadjusted for the Corporation\u2019s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates \nFVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized \nderivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the \ncollateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the \ndetermination of fair value, primarily based on market data. \nLoans and Loan Commitments \nThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where \navailable, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of \ncomparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or \ncomparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, \nas appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the \nborrower. \nMortgage Servicing Rights \nThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread \n(OAS) valuation approach, which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair \nvalue of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under \nmultiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-\nadjusted discount rates. \n151 Bank of America 2018 Loans Held-for-sale \nThe fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are \ndetermined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating \nthe Corporation\u2019s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the \ninherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the quoted \nmarket prices or is implied by considering loan performance when selecting \ncomparables. \nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt \nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms \nlinked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or \ncommodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using \nquantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes. \nThese models incorporate observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs \nincluding security prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, \ncommodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The Corporation \nalso considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate \nused to value these liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to \nobservable spreads in the secondary bond market.", "start_char_idx": 950, "end_char_idx": 5844, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "813d9114-d857-4209-89bb-7bf2e3a38777": {"__data__": {"id_": "813d9114-d857-4209-89bb-7bf2e3a38777", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75451393-ff77-4120-bbfe-d8db62e66438", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "5cdb18f8160daa3085a2c2a160442c52772e61b1ba3c32b6adf8507b03eb2bf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ef74705-c404-42fe-9611-b614828b19a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "b76949fe74944f03f08819ef125180450f11b1597da76c560bf12c6a44fed89f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b665b5aa-f05c-4678-abfe-eb2703b81391", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac818122c110deba790639954b8ee65a18784f2d5c094909ad8666486855dea1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5051190f8d102441946578eeefbcae6cc88d07add17e96816fa1f2e03a8aa468", "text": "The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the quoted \nmarket prices or is implied by considering loan performance when selecting \ncomparables. \nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt \nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms \nlinked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or \ncommodities.

For example, market comparables and discounted cash \nflows are used together. For a given product, such as corporate debt securities, \nmarket comparables may be used to estimate some of the unobservable inputs and \nthen these inputs are incorporated into a discounted cash flow model. Therefore, \nthe balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques. \nThe level of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed in the tables \nresults in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed across asset \nand liability categories. \nUncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from Unobservable \nInputs \nLoans and Securities \nA significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration \nwould have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for long positions. Short \npositions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of \nchanges in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending \non the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments \ncan be reinvested. A significant increase in price would have resulted in a \nsignificantly higher fair value for long positions, and short positions would have \nbeen impacted in a directionally opposite way. \nStructured Liabilities and Derivatives \nFor credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield, upfront points (i.e., a \nsingle upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), credit spreads, \ndefault rates or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value \nfor protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers. The impact of \nchanges in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending \non the seniority of the instrument. \nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default \ncorrelation is a parameter that describes the degree of \n159 Bank of America 2018 dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a \ncredit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies \ndepending on the level of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that are \nnet purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation would have \nresulted in a significantly higher fair value. Net short protection positions would \nhave been impacted in a directionally opposite way. \nFor equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and \nstructured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities and \ncorrelation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an \nindex, between two different commodities, between two different interest rates, or \nbetween interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would have resulted in a \nsignificant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of the \nimpact depend on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure. For \nstructured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have \nresulted in a significantly lower fair value. A significant decrease in duration would \nhave resulted in a significantly higher fair value. \nSensitivity of Fair Value Measurements for Mortgage \nServicing Rights \nThe weighted-average lives and fair value of MSRs are sensitive to changes in \nmodeled assumptions. The weighted-average life is a product of changes in market \nrates of interest, prepayment rates and other model and cash flow assumptions. \nThe weighted-average life represents the average period of time that the MSRs\u2019 \ncash flows are expected to be received. Absent other changes, an increase \n(decrease) to the weighted-average life would generally result in an increase \n(decrease) in the fair value of the MSRs. For example, a 10 percent or 20 percent \ndecrease in prepayment rates, which impacts the weighted-average life, could \nresult in an increase in fair value of $64 million or $133 million, while a 10 percent or \n20 percent increase in prepayment rates could result in a decrease in fair value of \n$59 million or $115 million.", "start_char_idx": 754, "end_char_idx": 5403, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b9819d4-b674-45d9-925c-6791213e010f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b9819d4-b674-45d9-925c-6791213e010f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d99bb6a7-31fa-4135-a838-fcaf1f3f57ff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "6608e29028cb005341c23bdee02363c96bfbcfadcfeeece3d2379d6891efa6e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "490e6287-7e1c-467c-b54e-238e6ffeafd7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "BofA 2018.pdf", "file_path": "data\\BOFA\\BofA 2018.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5023258, "creation_date": "2023-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-27", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-28"}, "hash": "3f3d71ce117029d92870190b87f54e55f03a3fbb8d25741e77fc65a01ea15101", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b7a0c7e-2ee2-491c-822e-807cdab1b42f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d9fca0e325bab0de37cead27a556e26be004dbcd6931ecb1814a0a6c5f43a846", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d73208db9ccb6a1576cf4a7f96ecfb6ab0bf3b256b7873284bef8b5212c66e07", "text": "Sensitivity of Fair Value Measurements for Mortgage \nServicing Rights \nThe weighted-average lives and fair value of MSRs are sensitive to changes in \nmodeled assumptions.

Corporation\u2019s operations are highly integrated with operations in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. The non-U.S. business activities are largely conducted in Europe, the \nMiddle East and Africa and in Asia. The Corporation identifies its geographic performance based on the business unit structure used to manage the capital or expense \ndeployed in the region as applicable. This requires certain judgments related to the allocation of revenue so that revenue can be appropriately matched with the related \ncapital or expense deployed in the region. Certain asset, liability, income and expense amounts have been allocated to arrive at total assets, total revenue, net of interest \nexpense, income before income taxes and net income by geographic area as presented below. \n(Dollars in millions) Total Assets at Year \nEnd (1) Total Revenue, Net \nof Interest \nExpense (2) Income Before \nIncome Taxes Net Income \nU.S. (3) 2018 $ 2,051,182 $

A Participant shall be given the opportunity to elect the following payment options at the time the Participant first elects \nto defer any payment under the Plan: \n(A) Single Cash Payment Following Termination of Service .

A Participant may be given the opportunity to elect to receive future payments in \nannual installments (provided the payout does not exceed 15 years). If a Participant to whom the installments method applies terminates service with the \nCorporation, the amount of such installments shall be calculated and paid pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph 5(f)(i)(B). The Participant\u2019s Accounts \nshall continue to be credited with adjustments under paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 5(e) above until the Accounts are fully paid out. The first installment shall \nbe paid by January 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such termination of services occurred, and each subsequent \ninstallment shall be paid by January 31 of the calendar year following the year in which such installment period ends. Each payment shall be calculated by \ndividing the Participant\u2019s balance in each Account by the number of remaining installment payments.

A Participant whose services with the Corporation have not terminated may change the form of \npayment elected under paragraph 5(f)(i) above only if (A) such election is made at least twelve (12) months prior to the date payment would have otherwise \ncommenced and (B) the effect of such elections is to defer commencement of such payment by at least five (5) years.

A Participant who is in active service with the Corporation may, in the Plan \nAdministrator\u2019s sole discretion, receive a payment of all or any part of the amounts previously credited to the Participant\u2019s Cash Account (but not Stock Account) in the \ncase of an \u201cunforeseeable emergency.\u201d A Participant requesting a payment pursuant to this subparagraph (g) shall have the burden of proof of establishing, to the \nPlan Administrator\u2019s satisfaction, the existence of such \u201cunforeseeable emergency,\u201d and the amount of the payment needed to satisfy the same. In that regard, the \nParticipant shall provide the Plan Administrator with such financial data and information as the Plan Administrator may request. If the Plan Administrator determines \nthat a payment should be made to a Participant under this subparagraph (g), such payment shall be made within a reasonable time after the Plan Administrator\u2019s \ndetermination of the existence of such \u201cunforeseeable emergency\u201d and the amount of payment so needed.

Examples of what are not considered to be \n\u201cunforeseeable emergencies\u201d include the need to send a Participant\u2019s child to college or the desire to purchase a home. Withdrawals of amounts because of an \n\u201cunforeseeable emergency\u201d shall not exceed an amount reasonably needed to satisfy the emergency need. \n(h) Vesting of Stock Units . For Stock Units credited to a Participant\u2019s Account related to a deferral of Stock Compensation under paragraph 5(c)(iii) \nabove, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 5(l), such Stock Units shall not become vested until the related \u201cvesting date\u201d under the agreement and/or plan \npursuant to which such Stock Compensation was awarded to Participant.
