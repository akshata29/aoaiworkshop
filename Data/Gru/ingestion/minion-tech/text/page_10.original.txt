Manufacturing Process
Our manufacturing process is streamlined for efficiency and innovation. The workflow is divided into several
stages:
1. Design and Prototyping: Led by Dr. Nefario and his team, this stage involves brainstorming, sketching,
and creating prototypes.
2. Material Sourcing: We source high-quality, durable materials, ensuring our products are safe and
long-lasting.
3. Assembly: Minions handle the assembly with precision and care, adhering to strict quality control
standards.
4. Testing: Each product undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets our safety and performance
criteria.
Supply Chain Management
We manage a robust supply chain, balancing cost-effectiveness with quick turnaround times. Our logistics
team, supervised by Minion Kevin, ensures timely delivery of materials and finished products.
