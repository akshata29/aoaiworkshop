The image is a screenshot of a document page titled "Best-selling Products Analysis" from a file named "minion-tech.md" dated 2024-01-06. It is page 19 out of 22 in the document. The page contains a table with five columns and three rows, excluding the header row. The columns are labeled as follows: Product, Cost (USD), Sales (USD), Profit (USD), Gross Margin (%), and Net Margin (%). Each row represents a different product with corresponding financial data.

The first product is "Freeze Ray" with a cost of $100,000, sales of $500,000, profit of $150,000, a gross margin of 70%, and a net margin of 30%. The second product is "Rocket Boots" with a cost of $150,000, sales of $450,000, profit of $120,000, a gross margin of 60%, and a net margin of 26.7%. The third product is "Bubble Gun" with a cost of $80,000, sales of $300,000, profit of $100,000, a gross margin of 66.7%, and a net margin of 33.3%.

The table provides a financial analysis of the best-selling products, showing the cost to produce each product, the sales revenue generated, the profit made, and the margins. This information is crucial for understanding the profitability of each product.

Here is the Markdown representation of the table:
