    "### Load and Index Data - Vector Store\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [Azure Cognitive Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) to load and index the data.  Azure Cognitive Search is a cloud search service with built-in AI capabilities that enrich all types of information to easily identify and explore relevant content at scale. It uses the same integrated Microsoft natural language stack that Bing and Office have used for more than a decade, and AI services across vision, language, and speech, to deliver knowledge from structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive search enabled the vector search feature! When done correctly, vector search is a proven technique for significantly increasing the semantic relevance of search results.  It is a technique that uses machine learning to embed text into a vector space, where the distance between vectors is a measure of semantic similarity.  This allows for the use of vector similarity search to find relevant results.  [Sign up]\n",
    "(https://aka.ms/VectorSearchSignUp) for Private Preview of Vector Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive Search can index and store vectors, but it doesn't generate them out of the box. The documents that you push to your search service must contain vectors within the payload. Alternatively, you can use the Indexer to pull vectors from your data sources such as Blob Storage JSON files or CSVs. You can also use a Custom Skill to generate embeddings as part of the AI Enrichment process.\n",
