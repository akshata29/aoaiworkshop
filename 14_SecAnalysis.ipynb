The pandemic-related issues have also exacerbated port congestion, intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, and labor shortages, leading to increased expenses, supply chain challenges, and difficulty in hiring and retaining workers. Additionally, the company may face challenges in launching and ramping up production of its products and features, as well as controlling manufacturing costs.
