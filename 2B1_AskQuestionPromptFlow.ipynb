Profits and losses on trading-purpose transactions are recognized on a trade date basis, and recorded \\nas “Trading income” and “Trading losses” on the consolidated statements of income. \\n\\nSecurities and monetary claims purchased for trading purposes are stated at the fiscal year-end market value, \\nand financial derivatives such as swaps, futures and options are stated at amounts that would be settled if the \\ntransactions were terminated at the consolidated balance sheet date. \\n\\n―16― \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c“Trading income” and “Trading losses” include interest received or paid during the fiscal year. The year-on-\\nyear  valuation  differences  of  securities  and  monetary  claims  are  also  recorded  in  the  above-mentioned \\naccounts. As for the derivatives, assuming that the settlement will be made in cash, the year-on-year valuation \\ndifferences are also recorded in the above-mentioned accounts. \\n\\nIn  terms  of  the  evaluation  of  specific  market  risks  and  credit  risks  for  derivative  transactions,  those  fair \\nvalues are calculated by group basis of the financial assets and liabilities based on net asset or liability after \\noffsetting. \\n\\n(2) Standards for recognition and measurement of securities \\n\\n1) Debt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity securities and are carried at amortized cost (based on \\nstraight-line method) using the moving-average method. Investments in affiliates that are not accounted for \\nby the equity method are carried at cost using the moving-average method. Other securities are carried at \\nfair value (cost of securities sold is calculated using primarily the moving average method). Stocks with no \\nmarket prices are carried at cost using the moving-average method.   \\n\\nNet  unrealized  gains  (losses)  on  other  securities  are  included  in  “Net  assets”  except  for  the  amount \\n\\nreflected on the gains or losses by applying fair value hedge accounting.   \\n\\n2) Securities included in money held in trust are carried in the same method as in (1) and (2), 1) above.', 'As for the individual hedges, SMBC also assesses the effectiveness of such individual hedges. \\n\\n2) Hedging against currency fluctuations \\n\\nSMBC, which is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, applies deferred hedge accounting stipulated \\nin  “Treatment  of  Accounting  and  Auditing  Concerning  Accounting  for  Foreign  Currency  Transactions  in \\nBanking  Industry”  (JICPA  Industry  Committee  Practical  Guideline  No.  25,  October  8,  2020)  to  currency \\nswap  and  foreign  exchange  swap  transactions  executed for  the  purpose  of  lending  or  borrowing  funds  in \\ndifferent currencies. \\n\\nPursuant to JICPA Industry Committee Practical Guideline No. 25, SMBC assesses the effectiveness of \\ncurrency  swap  and  foreign  exchange  swap  transactions  executed  for  the  purpose  of  offsetting  the  risk  of \\nchanges in currency exchange rates by verifying that there are foreign-currency monetary claims and debts \\ncorresponding to the foreign-currency positions. \\n\\nIn order to hedge risk arising from volatility of exchange rates for stocks of subsidiaries and affiliates and \\nother  securities  (excluding  bonds)  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  SMBC  applies  deferred  hedge \\naccounting  or  fair  value  hedge  accounting,  on  the  conditions  that  the  hedged  securities  are  designated  in \\nadvance and that sufficient on-balance (actual) or off-balance (forward) liability exposure exists to cover the \\ncost of the hedged securities denominated in the same foreign currencies. \\n\\n3) Hedging against share price fluctuations \\n\\nSMBC,  which  is  a  consolidated  subsidiary,  applies  fair  value  hedge  accounting  to  individual  hedges \\noffsetting  the  price  fluctuation  of  the  shares  that  are  classified  under  other  securities,  and  accordingly \\nevaluates the effectiveness of such individual hedges. \\n\\n4) Transactions between consolidated subsidiaries \\n\\nAs for derivative transactions between consolidated subsidiaries or internal transactions between trading \\naccounts  and  other  accounts  (or  among  internal  sections),  SMBC  manages  the  interest  rate  swaps  and \\ncurrency swaps that are designated as hedging instruments in accordance with the non-arbitrary and strict \\ncriteria for external transactions stipulated in JICPA Industry Committee Practical Guidelines No. 24 and No. \\n25. Therefore, SMBC accounts for the gains or losses that arise from interest rate swaps and currency swaps \\nin its earnings or defers them, rather than eliminating them. \\n\\nCertain other consolidated subsidiaries apply the deferred hedge accounting, fair value hedge accounting \\n\\nor the special treatment for interest rate swaps. \\n\\n―21― \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c(18) Amortization of goodwill \\n\\nGoodwill  is  amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  a  period  in  which  its  benefit  is  expected  to  be \\nrealized, not to exceed 20 years.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience.

The balance sheet dates of consolidated subsidiaries \\\\n\\\\n(1) The balance sheet dates of the consolidated subsidiaries at March 31, 2023 were as follows: \\\\n\\\\nJune 30 \\\\nOctober 31 \\\\nDecember 31 \\\\nMarch 31 \\\\n\\\\n1 \\\\n2 \\\\n93 \\\\n88 \\\\n\\\\n(2) The subsidiary with balance sheets dated June 30 is consolidated using the financial statements as of December \\\\n31, the subsidiaries with balance sheets dated October 31 are consolidated using the financial statements as of \\\\nJanuary  31,  and  certain  subsidiaries  with  balance  sheets  dated  December  31  are  consolidated  using  the \\\\nfinancial statements as of March 31. Other subsidiaries are consolidated using the financial statements as of \\\\ntheir respective balance sheet dates. \\\\n\\\\nAppropriate  adjustments  are  made  to  material  transactions  during  the  periods  between  their  respective \\\\n\\\\nbalance sheet dates and the consolidated closing date. \\\\n\\\\n4. Accounting policies \\\\n\\\\n(1) Standards for recognition and measurement of trading assets/liabilities and trading income/losses \\\\n\\\\nTransactions for trading purposes (seeking gains arising from short-term changes in interest rates, currency \\\\nexchange  rates,  or  market  prices  of  securities  and  other  market  related  indices  or  from  variation  among \\\\nmarkets) are included in “Trading assets” or “Trading liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets on a trade \\\\ndate basis. Profits and losses on trading-purpose transactions are recognized on a trade date basis, and recorded \\\\nas “Trading income” and “Trading losses” on the consolidated statements of income. \\\\n\\\\nSecurities and monetary claims purchased for trading purposes are stated at the fiscal year-end market value, \\\\nand financial derivatives such as swaps, futures and options are stated at amounts that would be settled if the \\\\ntransactions were terminated at the consolidated balance sheet date. \\\\n\\\\n―16― \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n   \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c“Trading income” and “Trading losses” include interest received or paid during the fiscal year. The year-on-\\\\nyear  valuation  differences  of  securities  and  monetary  claims  are  also  recorded  in  the  above-mentioned \\\\naccounts. As for the derivatives, assuming that the settlement will be made in cash, the year-on-year valuation \\\\ndifferences are also recorded in the above-mentioned accounts. \\\\n\\\\nIn  terms  of  the  evaluation  of  specific  market  risks  and  credit  risks  for  derivative  transactions,  those  fair \\\\nvalues are calculated by group basis of the financial assets and liabilities based on net asset or liability after \\\\noffsetting. \\\\n\\\\n(2) Standards for recognition and measurement of securities \\\\n\\\\n1) Debt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity securities and are carried at amortized cost (based on \\\\nstraight-line method) using the moving-average method. Investments in affiliates that are not accounted for \\\\nby the equity method are carried at cost using the moving-average method. Other securities are carried at \\\\nfair value (cost of securities sold is calculated using primarily the moving average method). Stocks with no \\\\nmarket prices are carried at cost using the moving-average method.   \\\\n\\\\nNet  unrealized  gains  (losses)  on  other  securities  are  included  in  “Net  assets”  except  for  the  amount \\\\n\\\\nreflected on the gains or losses by applying fair value hedge accounting.   \\\\n\\\\n2) Securities included in money held in trust are carried in the same method as in (1) and (2), 1) above.', 'As for the individual hedges, SMBC also assesses the effectiveness of such individual hedges. \\\\n\\\\n2) Hedging against currency fluctuations \\\\n\\\\nSMBC, which is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, applies deferred hedge accounting stipulated \\\\nin  “Treatment  of  Accounting  and  Auditing  Concerning  Accounting  for  Foreign  Currency  Transactions  in \\\\nBanking  Industry”  (JICPA  Industry  Committee  Practical  Guideline  No.  25,  October  8,  2020)  to  currency \\\\nswap  and  foreign  exchange  swap  transactions  executed for  the  purpose  of  lending  or  borrowing  funds  in \\\\ndifferent currencies. \\\\n\\\\nPursuant to JICPA Industry Committee Practical Guideline No. 25, SMBC assesses the effectiveness of \\\\ncurrency  swap  and  foreign  exchange  swap  transactions  executed  for  the  purpose  of  offsetting  the  risk  of \\\\nchanges in currency exchange rates by verifying that there are foreign-currency monetary claims and debts \\\\ncorresponding to the foreign-currency positions. \\\\n\\\\nIn order to hedge risk arising from volatility of exchange rates for stocks of subsidiaries and affiliates and \\\\nother  securities  (excluding  bonds)  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  SMBC  applies  deferred  hedge \\\\naccounting  or  fair  value  hedge  accounting,  on  the  conditions  that  the  hedged  securities  are  designated  in \\\\nadvance and that sufficient on-balance (actual) or off-balance (forward) liability exposure exists to cover the \\\\ncost of the hedged securities denominated in the same foreign currencies. \\\\n\\\\n3) Hedging against share price fluctuations \\\\n\\\\nSMBC,  which  is  a  consolidated  subsidiary,  applies  fair  value  hedge  accounting  to  individual  hedges \\\\noffsetting  the  price  fluctuation  of  the  shares  that  are  classified  under  other  securities,  and  accordingly \\\\nevaluates the effectiveness of such individual hedges. \\\\n\\\\n4) Transactions between consolidated subsidiaries \\\\n\\\\nAs for derivative transactions between consolidated subsidiaries or internal transactions between trading \\\\naccounts  and  other  accounts  (or  among  internal  sections),  SMBC  manages  the  interest  rate  swaps  and \\\\ncurrency swaps that are designated as hedging instruments in accordance with the non-arbitrary and strict \\\\ncriteria for external transactions stipulated in JICPA Industry Committee Practical Guidelines No. 24 and No. \\\\n25. Therefore, SMBC accounts for the gains or losses that arise from interest rate swaps and currency swaps \\\\nin its earnings or defers them, rather than eliminating them. \\\\n\\\\nCertain other consolidated subsidiaries apply the deferred hedge accounting, fair value hedge accounting \\\\n\\\\nor the special treatment for interest rate swaps. \\\\n\\\\n―21― \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c(18) Amortization of goodwill \\\\n\\\\nGoodwill  is  amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  a  period  in  which  its  benefit  is  expected  to  be \\\\nrealized, not to exceed 20 years. Immaterial goodwill is charged or credited to income directly when incurred. \\\\n\\\\n(19) Scope of “Cash and cash equivalents” on consolidated statements of cash flows \\\\n\\\\nFor the purpose of presenting the consolidated statements of cash flows, “Cash and cash equivalents” are \\\\n\\\\ncash on hand, non-interest earning deposits with banks and deposits with the Bank of Japan.   \\\\n\\\\n(20) Adoption of the group tax sharing system \\\\n\\\\nThe Company and certain consolidated domestic subsidiaries apply the group tax sharing system. \\\\n\\\\n―22― \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c(Significant Accounting Estimates) \\\\n\\\\n1.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\\\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\\\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\\\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\\\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\\\n\\\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\\\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf09e \\\\n\\\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\\\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\\\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\\\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\\\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\\\ncontrol.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\\\n\\\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\\\non the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf09e \\\\n\\\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\\\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\\\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\\\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\\\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to \\\\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\\\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\\\nauditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\\\ngoing concern.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf09e \\\\n\\\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\\\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\\\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\\\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\\\nachieves fair presentation. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\\\n\\\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\\\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\\\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\\\n\\\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\\\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\\\nidentify during our audit.  \\\\n\\\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\\\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\\\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\\\n\\\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\\\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\\\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes \\\\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\\\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\\\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0cConvenience Translation \\\\n\\\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\\\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience.
