In the case of dataframes, in which columns did the variables of interest in the question appear in the dataframe? use the str.contains method on **ALL** the columns in the dataframe to determine the columns. You **MUST** test **ALL THE COLUMNS**. (as an example, the following code snippet would show the relevant columns for a specific varibale of interest: relevant_rows = dataframe[dataframe.apply(lambda row: row.astype(str).str.contains(<VARIABLE OF INTEREST>).any(), axis=1)] - you can modify the code to suit the the question being asked). Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.\n",
    "    5. If you want to generate RegEx expressions, make sure that the RegEx expression is valid. Do **NOT** generate something like this: str.replace('[extbackslash\textdollar,]', '', regex=True), which is obviously invalid, since the $ sign is spelled as 'extdollar', and the '\\\\' is spelled as 'extbackslash'.\n",
    "    6. If you have trouble accessing the previously defined variables or the dataframes for any reasons, then use the Python Codeblocks delimited by '## START OF CODEBLOCK' and '## END OF CODEBLOCK' to extract the information you need, and then generate the needed Python code.\n",
    "    7. Generate the answer to the query. You **MUST** clarify AND print to the output **ALL** calculation steps leading up to the final answer.\n",

Please reference the PDF Document and the page number you got the answer from, e.g. \"This answer was derived from document 'Sales_Presentation.pdf', page 34\".\n",
    "    9. If the answer contains numerical data, then you **MUST** create an Excel file with an extension .xlsx with the data, you **MUST** include inside the Excel the steps of the calculations, the justification, and **ALL** the reference and source numbers and tables that you used to come up with a final answer in addition to the final answer (this Excel is meant for human consumption, do **NOT** use programming variable names as column or row headers, instead use names that are fully meaningful to humans), you **MUST** be elaborate in your comments and rows and column names inside the Excel, you **MUST** save it to the working directory, and then you **MUST** print the full path of the Excel sheet with the final answer - use os.path.abs() to print the full path.\n",
    "    10. **VERY IMPORTANT**: do **NOT** attempt to create a list of variables or dataframes directly. Instead, you should access the data from the variables and dataframes that were defined in the Python file that was run.\n",

Describe in details the computation steps you took, quote values and quantities, describe equations as if you are explaining a solution of a math problem to a 12-year old student. Please relay all steps to the user, and clarify how you got to the final answer. Please reference the PDF Document and the page number you got the answer from, e.g. \"This answer was derived from document 'Sales_Presentation.pdf', page 34\".

To estimate the R&D expense for the missing year 2020, we can observe the trend of the R&D expenses over the years provided. There is a consistent increase of $60,000 per year from 2021 to 2023. Using this trend, we can extrapolate the R&D expense for 2020 by subtracting $60,000 from the 2021 figure, which would give us an estimated expense of $440,000 for 2020.\\n\\nNow, we can sum up the expenses to get the total R&D expense from 2020 to 2023:\\n\\n- 2020: $440,000 (estimated)\\n- 2021: $500,000\\n- 2022: $560,000\\n- 2023: $620,000\\n\\nTotal R&D expense = $440,000 + $500,000 + $560,000 + $620,000 = $2,120,000\\n\\nIn millions, this is $2.12 million.
