    "\n",
    "Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-3, Codex and Embeddings model series. In addition, the new GPT-4 and ChatGPT (gpt-35-turbo) model series have now reached general availability. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio."

For example, the word “hamburger” gets broken up into the tokens “ham”, “bur” and “ger”, while a short and common word like “pear” is a single token. Many tokens start with a whitespace, for example “ hello” and “ bye”.\n",

    "#### Key concepts - In-context learning\n",
    "The models used by Azure OpenAI use natural language instructions and examples provided during the generation call to identify the task being asked and skill required. When you use this approach, the first part of the prompt includes natural language instructions and/or examples of the specific task desired. The model then completes the task by predicting the most probable next piece of text. This technique is known as \"in-context\" learning. These models aren't retrained during this step but instead give predictions based on the context you include in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main approaches for in-context learning: Few-shot, one-shot and zero-shot. These approaches vary based on the amount of task-specific data that is given to the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Few-shot: In this case, a user includes several examples in the call prompt that demonstrate the expected answer format and content. The number of examples typically range from 0 to 100 depending on how many can fit in the maximum input length for a single prompt. Maximum input length can vary depending on the specific models you use. Few-shot learning enables a major reduction in the amount of task-specific data required for accurate predictions. This approach will typically perform less accurately than a fine-tuned model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One-shot: This case is the same as the few-shot approach except only one example is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero-shot: In this case, no examples are provided to the model and only the task request is provided."
