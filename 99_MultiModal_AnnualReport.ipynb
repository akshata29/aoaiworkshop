Also print all the variable assignment statements. Include the dataframes assignment statements in the output. Limit this list to the relevant dataframes **ONLY**. Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.\n",
    "    4. In the case of dataframes, in which columns did the variables of interest in the question appear in the dataframe? use the str.contains method on **ALL** the columns in the dataframe to determine the columns.

Additionally, transactions between U.S. banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on arm\\'s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Deposit Insurance  \\n  \\nDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC\\'s regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits are $250,000 per customer. All insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in order to fund the DIF.  \\n  \\nThe FDIC is required to maintain at least a designated minimum ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the U.S. The Financial Reform Act requires the FDIC to assess insured depository institutions to achieve a DIF ratio of at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020. In November 2018, the FDIC announced that the DIF ratio exceeded 1.35 in advance of the deadline and that the related surcharges ceased. Additionally, the FDIC adopted regulations that establish a long-term target DIF ratio of greater than two percent. As of the date of this report, the DIF ratio is below this required target and the FDIC has adopted a restoration plan that may result in increased deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. For more information regarding deposit insurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulatory, Compliance and Legal on page 13.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Capital, Liquidity and Operational Requirements  \\n  \\nAs a financial holding company, we and our bank subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, including the FDIC and the OCC. These rules are complex and are evolving as U.S. and international regulatory authorities propose and enact enhanced capital and liquidity rules. The Corporation seeks to manage its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to meet these regulatory guidelines and to support our business activities. These evolving rules are likely to influence our planning processes and may require additional regulatory capital and liquidity, as well as impose additional operational and compliance costs on the Corporation. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design, implementation and board oversight of BHCs\\' and national  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"3 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\nbanks\\' risk governance frameworks. The Federal Reserve also issued a final rule, which became effective January 1, 2019, that includes minimum external total loss- absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt requirements.  \\n  \\nFor more information on regulatory capital rules, capital composition and pending or proposed regulatory capital changes, see Capital Management - Regulatory Capital in the MD&A on page 44, and Note 16 - Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated by reference in this Item 1.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Distributions  \\n  \\nWe are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital actions, including payment of dividends and common stock repurchases. For instance, Federal Reserve regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The purpose of the CCAR for the Federal Reserve is to assess the capital planning process of the BHC, including any planned capital actions, such as payment of dividends and common stock repurchases.  \\n  \\nOur ability to pay dividends is also affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and non-capital standards established under the FDICIA. The right of the Corporation, our shareholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries is further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries.  \\n  \\nIf the Federal Reserve finds that any of our Banks are not \"well-capitalized\" or \"well-managed,\" we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. Additionally, the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or BHC, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof.  \\n  \\nFor more information regarding the requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including the minimum capital requirements, see Note 13 - Shareholders\\' Equity and Note 16 - Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Resolution Planning  \\n  \\nAs a BHC with greater than $50 billion of assets, the Corporation is required by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.  \\n  \\nSuch resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the BHC and its material entities pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable resolution regimes under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance.  \\n  \\nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that the BHC\\'s plan is not credible, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations. A description of our plan is available on the Federal Reserve and FDIC websites.  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.016393441706895828, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'As part of its annual CCAR review, the Federal Reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve.', 'highlights': 'As part of its annual<em> CCAR review,</em><em> the Federal Reserve</em> conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by<em> the Federal Reserve.</em>'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 1.6420801877975464, 'asset_id': 'd98b90c8-288b-f839-7323-24ca8454485b', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_17.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_17.txt', 'page_number': '17', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_17.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_17.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_17.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'In the current regulatory environment, capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended. It is possible that regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements including TLAC and long-term debt requirements, change how regulatory capital is calculated or increase liquidity requirements. Our risk-based capital surcharge (G-SIB surcharge) may increase from current estimates, and we are also subject to a countercyclical capital buffer which, while currently set at zero, may be increased by regulators. In 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal to implement a stress capital buffer into its capital requirements, which may increase our regulatory capital requirements, if adopted. A significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our risk-weighted assets and our leverage exposure which may increase. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring risk- weighted assets, including a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized approach for operational risk and constraints on the use of internal models, as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches. U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions. In 2018, U.S. banking regulators published a proposal outlining a standardized approach for counterparty credit risk, which updates the calculation of the exposure amount for derivative contracts under the regulatory capital rule. Additionally, Net Stable Funding Ratio requirements have been proposed, which would apply to us and our subsidiary depository institutions, and target longer term liquidity risk. While the impact of these proposals remains uncertain, they could have a negative impact on our capital and liquidity positions.  \\n  \\nAs part of its annual CCAR review, the Federal Reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test results, which may have an effect on our projected regulatory capital amounts in the annual CCAR submission, including the CCAR capital plan affecting our dividends and stock repurchases.  \\n  \\nChanges to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets, increase borrowings, issue additional equity or other securities, cease or alter certain operations, sell company assets, or hold highly liquid assets, which may adversely affect our results of operations. We may be prohibited from taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends, or repurchasing securities if the Federal Reserve objects to our CCAR capital plan.  \\n  \\nFor more information, see Capital Management - Regulatory Capital in the MD&A on page 44 and Note 16 - Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nChanges in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us.  \\n  \\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate prior-period financial statements. Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the accounting standards, the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report  \\n  \\nour financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in us revising prior-period financial statements.  \\n  \\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard with respect to accounting for credit losses that will become effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020. The standard replaces the existing measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which is based on management\\'s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Corporation\\'s lending activities, with management\\'s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation\\'s financial assets that are recognized at amortized cost. The standard will also expand credit quality disclosures. The impact of this new accounting standard may be an increase in the Corporation\\'s allowance for credit losses at the date of adoption which would result in a negative adjustment to retained earnings. The ultimate impact will depend on the characteristics of the Corporation\\'s portfolio at adoption date as well as the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts as of that date. For more information on some of our critical accounting policies and recent accounting changes, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A on page 77 and Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations.  \\n  \\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) which made significant changes to federal income tax law including, among other things, reducing the statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and changing the taxation of our non-U.S. business activities.  \\n  \\nIn addition, we have U.K. net deferred tax assets which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors, such as prolonged worsening of Europe\\'s capital markets or changes in the ability of our U.K. subsidiaries to conduct business in the EU, could lead our management to reassess and/or change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our U.K. net deferred tax assets.  \\n  \\nIt is possible that governmental authorities in the U.S. and/or other countries could further amend tax laws that would adversely affect us, including the possibility that certain favorable aspects of the Tax Act could be amended in the future.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Reputation  \\n  \\nDamage to our reputation could harm our businesses, including our competitive position and business prospects.  \\n  \\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including officer, director or employee misconduct, security breaches, unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, compensation practices, the suitability or reasonableness of recommending particular trading or investment strategies, including the reliability of our research and models, prohibiting clients from engaging in certain transactions and sales practices. Additionally, our reputation may be harmed by failing to deliver products, subpar standards of service and quality expected by our customers, clients and the community, compliance failures, inadequacy of responsiveness to internal controls, unintended disclosure of personal, proprietary or confidential information, perception of our environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.

As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation\\'s TLAC and long-term debt exceeded our estimated 2019 minimum requirements.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Stress Buffer Requirements  \\n  \\nOn April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve announced a proposal to integrate the annual quantitative assessment of the CCAR program with the buffer requirements in the Basel 3 capital rule by introducing stress buffer requirements as a replacement of the CCAR quantitative objection. Under the Standardized approach, the proposal replaces the existing static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer with a stress capital buffer, calculated as the decrease in the CET1 capital ratio in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the modified CCAR stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividend payments, floored at 2.5 percent. The static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer would be retained under the Advanced approaches. The proposal also introduces a stress leverage buffer requirement which would be calculated as the decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the modified CCAR stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, with  \\n  \\nno floor. The SLR would not incorporate a stress buffer requirement. The proposal also updates the capital distribution assumptions used in the CCAR stress test to better align with a firm\\'s expected actions in stress, notably removing the assumption that a BHC will carry out all of its planned capital actions under stress.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio and TLAC Requirements  \\n  \\nOn April 11, 2018, the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced a proposal to modify the enhanced SLR standards applicable to U.S. G-SIBs and their insured depository institution subsidiaries. The proposal replaces the existing 2.0 percent leverage buffer with a leverage buffer tailored to each G-SIB, set at 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge. This proposal also replaces the current 6.0 percent threshold at which a G-SIB\\'s insured depository institution subsidiaries are considered well capitalized under the PCA framework with a threshold set at 3.0 percent plus 50 percent of the G-SIB surcharge applicable to the subsidiary\\'s G-SIB holding company. Correspondingly, the proposal updates the external TLAC leverage buffer for each G-SIB to 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge and revises the leverage component of the minimum external long-term debt requirement from 4.5 percent to 2.5 percent plus 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bank of America 2018 46\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.016129031777381897, '@search.captions': [{'text': \"# Recent Developments         # Capital Management      During 2018, we repurchased $20.1 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors' (the Board) repurchase authorizations under our 2018 and 2017 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) plans, including repurchases to offset equity-based compensation awards.\", 'highlights': ''}], '@search.rerankerScore': 1.9208792448043823, 'asset_id': 'a17ef087-cb8a-94a4-c474-bc809124cf1e', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_23.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_23.txt', 'page_number': '23', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_23.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_23.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_23.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with more than36 million active users, including over26 million active mobile users.

In March 2017, the U.K. notified the EU of its intent to withdraw from the EU, which is scheduled to occur on March 29, 2019. Negotiations between the U.K. and the EU regarding the terms, conditions and timing of the withdrawal are ongoing and the outcome remains uncertain. In preparation for the withdrawal, we have implemented changes to our operating model in the region, including establishing our principal EU banking and broker-dealer operations outside the U.K. The changes are expected to enable us to continue to service our clients with minimal disruption, retain operational flexibility, minimize transition risks and maximize legal entity efficiencies, independent of the outcome and timing of the withdrawal.  \\n  \\n  \\n# LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates  \\n  \\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. This announcement along with financial benchmark reforms more generally and changes in the interbank lending markets have resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR and certain other rates or indices used as interest rate \"benchmarks.\" These actions and uncertainties may trigger future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks or lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks.  \\n  \\nThe Corporation has established an enterprise-wide initiative to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the potential discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including LIBOR, and the transition to alternative reference rates. As part of this initiative, the Corporation is actively engaged with global regulators, industry working groups and trade associations to develop strategies for transitions from current benchmarks to alternative reference rates. We are updating our operational processes and models to support new alternative reference rate  \\n  \\nactivity. In addition, we continue to analyze and evaluate legacy contracts across all products to determine the impact of adiscontinuation of LIBOR or other benchmarks and to address consequential changes to those legacy contracts. Certain actions required to mitigate risks associated with the unavailability of benchmarks and implementation of new methodologies and contractual mechanics are dependent on a consensus being reached by the industry or the markets in various jurisdictions around the world. As a result, there is uncertainty as to the solutions that will be developed to address the unavailability of LIBOR or other benchmarks, as well as the overall impact to our businesses, operations and results. Additionally, any transition from current benchmarks may alter the Corporation\\'s risk profiles and models, valuation tools, product design and effectiveness of hedging strategies, as well as increase the costs and risks related to potential regulatory requirements.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Financial Highlights  \\n  \\n  \\n## Table 1 Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data  \\n  \\n| (Dollars in millions, except per share information) | 2018 | 2017 |  \\n| - | - | - |  \\n| Income statement | | |  \\n| Net interest income | $ 47,432 | $ 44,667 |  \\n| Noninterest income | 43,815 | 42,685 |  \\n| Total revenue, net of interest expense | 91,247 | 87,352 |  \\n| Provision for credit losses | 3,282 | 3,396 |  \\n| Noninterest expense | 53,381 | 54,743 |  \\n| Income before income taxes | 34,584 | 29,213 |  \\n| Income tax expense | 6,437 | 10,981 |  \\n| Net income | 28,147 | 18,232 |  \\n| Preferred stock dividends | 1,451 | 1,614 |  \\n| Net income applicable to common shareholders | $ 26,696 | $ 16,618 |  \\n| Per common share information | | |  \\n| Earnings | 2.64 | 1.63 |  \\n| Diluted earnings | 2.61 | 1.56 |  \\n| Dividends paid | 0.54 | 0.39 |  \\n| Performance ratios | | |  \\n| Return on average assets | 1.21 % | 0.80 % |  \\n| Return on average common shareholders\\' equity | 11.04 | 6.72 |  \\n| Return on average tangible common shareholders\\' equity (1) | 15.55 | 9.41 |  \\n| Efficiency ratio | 58.50 | 62.67 |  \\n| Balance sheet at year end | | |  \\n| Total loans and leases | $ 946,895 | $ 936,749 |  \\n| Total assets | 2,354,507 | 2,281,234 |  \\n| Total deposits | 1,381,476 | 1,309,545 |  \\n| Total common shareholders\\' equity | 242,999 | 244,823 |  \\n| Total shareholders\\' equity | 265,325 | 267,146 |  \\n  \\n(1) Return on average tangible common shareholders\\' equity is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The improvement in net income was driven by a decrease in income tax expense due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), an increase in net interest income, higher noninterest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense. Impacts from the Tax Act include a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. In addition, results for 2017 included a reduction in net income of $2.9 billion due to the Tax Act, driven largely by a lower valuation of certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"21 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.010526316240429878, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) - A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: \"well capitalized,\" \"adequately capitalized,\" \"undercapitalized,\" \"significantly undercapitalized\" and \"critically undercapitalized.\"', 'highlights': 'Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) - A framework established by the U.S.<em> banking</em> regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: \"well capitalized,\" \"adequately capitalized,\" \"undercapitalized,\" \"significantly undercapitalized\" and \"critically undercapitalized.\"'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 1.7690333127975464, 'asset_id': '1812dc44-7470-49b9-0b3b-ddac55ccad53', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_182.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_182.txt', 'page_number': '182', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_182.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_182.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_182.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'Glossary  \\n  \\nAlt-A Mortgage - A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or \"prime,\" and less risky than \"subprime,\" the riskiest category.

Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC, either as a result of default of a bank subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default, the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the FDIC\\'s loss, subject to certain exceptions.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Transactions with Affiliates  \\n  \\nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve\\'s Regulation W, the Banks are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between the Banks and their nonbank affiliates. In general, U.S. banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving its nonbank affiliates. Additionally, transactions between U.S. banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on arm\\'s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Deposit Insurance  \\n  \\nDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC\\'s regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits are $250,000 per customer. All insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in order to fund the DIF.  \\n  \\nThe FDIC is required to maintain at least a designated minimum ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the U.S. The Financial Reform Act requires the FDIC to assess insured depository institutions to achieve a DIF ratio of at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020. In November 2018, the FDIC announced that the DIF ratio exceeded 1.35 in advance of the deadline and that the related surcharges ceased. Additionally, the FDIC adopted regulations that establish a long-term target DIF ratio of greater than two percent. As of the date of this report, the DIF ratio is below this required target and the FDIC has adopted a restoration plan that may result in increased deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. For more information regarding deposit insurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulatory, Compliance and Legal on page 13.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Capital, Liquidity and Operational Requirements  \\n  \\nAs a financial holding company, we and our bank subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, including the FDIC and the OCC. These rules are complex and are evolving as U.S. and international regulatory authorities propose and enact enhanced capital and liquidity rules. The Corporation seeks to manage its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to meet these regulatory guidelines and to support our business activities. These evolving rules are likely to influence our planning processes and may require additional regulatory capital and liquidity, as well as impose additional operational and compliance costs on the Corporation. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design, implementation and board oversight of BHCs\\' and national  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"3 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\nbanks\\' risk governance frameworks. The Federal Reserve also issued a final rule, which became effective January 1, 2019, that includes minimum external total loss- absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt requirements.  \\n  \\nFor more information on regulatory capital rules, capital composition and pending or proposed regulatory capital changes, see Capital Management - Regulatory Capital in the MD&A on page 44, and Note 16 - Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated by reference in this Item 1.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Distributions  \\n  \\nWe are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital actions, including payment of dividends and common stock repurchases. For instance, Federal Reserve regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The purpose of the CCAR for the Federal Reserve is to assess the capital planning process of the BHC, including any planned capital actions, such as payment of dividends and common stock repurchases.  \\n  \\nOur ability to pay dividends is also affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and non-capital standards established under the FDICIA. The right of the Corporation, our shareholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries is further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries.  \\n  \\nIf the Federal Reserve finds that any of our Banks are not \"well-capitalized\" or \"well-managed,\" we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. Additionally, the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or BHC, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof.  \\n  \\nFor more information regarding the requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including the minimum capital requirements, see Note 13 - Shareholders\\' Equity and Note 16 - Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Resolution Planning  \\n  \\nAs a BHC with greater than $50 billion of assets, the Corporation is required by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.  \\n  \\nSuch resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the BHC and its material entities pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable resolution regimes under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance.  \\n  \\nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that the BHC\\'s plan is not credible, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations.

It is possible that regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements including TLAC and long-term debt requirements, change how regulatory capital is calculated or increase liquidity requirements. Our risk-based capital surcharge (G-SIB surcharge) may increase from current estimates, and we are also subject to a countercyclical capital buffer which, while currently set at zero, may be increased by regulators. In 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal to implement a stress capital buffer into its capital requirements, which may increase our regulatory capital requirements, if adopted. A significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our risk-weighted assets and our leverage exposure which may increase. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring risk- weighted assets, including a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized approach for operational risk and constraints on the use of internal models, as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches. U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions. In 2018, U.S. banking regulators published a proposal outlining a standardized approach for counterparty credit risk, which updates the calculation of the exposure amount for derivative contracts under the regulatory capital rule. Additionally, Net Stable Funding Ratio requirements have been proposed, which would apply to us and our subsidiary depository institutions, and target longer term liquidity risk. While the impact of these proposals remains uncertain, they could have a negative impact on our capital and liquidity positions.  \\n  \\nAs part of its annual CCAR review, the Federal Reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test results, which may have an effect on our projected regulatory capital amounts in the annual CCAR submission, including the CCAR capital plan affecting our dividends and stock repurchases.  \\n  \\nChanges to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets, increase borrowings, issue additional equity or other securities, cease or alter certain operations, sell company assets, or hold highly liquid assets, which may adversely affect our results of operations. We may be prohibited from taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends, or repurchasing securities if the Federal Reserve objects to our CCAR capital plan.  \\n  \\nFor more information, see Capital Management - Regulatory Capital in the MD&A on page 44 and Note 16 - Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nChanges in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us.  \\n  \\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate prior-period financial statements. Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the accounting standards, the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report  \\n  \\nour financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in us revising prior-period financial statements.  \\n  \\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard with respect to accounting for credit losses that will become effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020. The standard replaces the existing measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which is based on management\\'s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Corporation\\'s lending activities, with management\\'s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation\\'s financial assets that are recognized at amortized cost. The standard will also expand credit quality disclosures. The impact of this new accounting standard may be an increase in the Corporation\\'s allowance for credit losses at the date of adoption which would result in a negative adjustment to retained earnings. The ultimate impact will depend on the characteristics of the Corporation\\'s portfolio at adoption date as well as the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts as of that date. For more information on some of our critical accounting policies and recent accounting changes, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A on page 77 and Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations.  \\n  \\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) which made significant changes to federal income tax law including, among other things, reducing the statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and changing the taxation of our non-U.S. business activities.  \\n  \\nIn addition, we have U.K. net deferred tax assets which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors, such as prolonged worsening of Europe\\'s capital markets or changes in the ability of our U.K. subsidiaries to conduct business in the EU, could lead our management to reassess and/or change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our U.K. net deferred tax assets.  \\n  \\nIt is possible that governmental authorities in the U.S. and/or other countries could further amend tax laws that would adversely affect us, including the possibility that certain favorable aspects of the Tax Act could be amended in the future.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Reputation  \\n  \\nDamage to our reputation could harm our businesses, including our competitive position and business prospects.  \\n  \\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including officer, director or employee misconduct, security breaches, unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, compensation practices, the suitability or reasonableness of recommending particular trading or investment strategies, including the reliability of our research and models, prohibiting clients from engaging in certain transactions and sales practices. Additionally, our reputation may be harmed by failing to deliver products, subpar standards of service and quality expected by our customers, clients and the community, compliance failures, inadequacy of responsiveness to internal controls, unintended disclosure of personal, proprietary or confidential information, perception of our environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.

As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation\\'s TLAC and long-term debt exceeded our estimated 2019 minimum requirements.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Stress Buffer Requirements  \\n  \\nOn April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve announced a proposal to integrate the annual quantitative assessment of the CCAR program with the buffer requirements in the Basel 3 capital rule by introducing stress buffer requirements as a replacement of the CCAR quantitative objection. Under the Standardized approach, the proposal replaces the existing static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer with a stress capital buffer, calculated as the decrease in the CET1 capital ratio in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the modified CCAR stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividend payments, floored at 2.5 percent. The static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer would be retained under the Advanced approaches. The proposal also introduces a stress leverage buffer requirement which would be calculated as the decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the modified CCAR stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, with  \\n  \\nno floor. The SLR would not incorporate a stress buffer requirement. The proposal also updates the capital distribution assumptions used in the CCAR stress test to better align with a firm\\'s expected actions in stress, notably removing the assumption that a BHC will carry out all of its planned capital actions under stress.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio and TLAC Requirements  \\n  \\nOn April 11, 2018, the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced a proposal to modify the enhanced SLR standards applicable to U.S. G-SIBs and their insured depository institution subsidiaries. The proposal replaces the existing 2.0 percent leverage buffer with a leverage buffer tailored to each G-SIB, set at 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge. This proposal also replaces the current 6.0 percent threshold at which a G-SIB\\'s insured depository institution subsidiaries are considered well capitalized under the PCA framework with a threshold set at 3.0 percent plus 50 percent of the G-SIB surcharge applicable to the subsidiary\\'s G-SIB holding company. Correspondingly, the proposal updates the external TLAC leverage buffer for each G-SIB to 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge and revises the leverage component of the minimum external long-term debt requirement from 4.5 percent to 2.5 percent plus 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bank of America 2018 46\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.016129031777381897, '@search.captions': [{'text': \"# Recent Developments         # Capital Management      During 2018, we repurchased $20.1 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors' (the Board) repurchase authorizations under our 2018 and 2017 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) plans, including repurchases to offset equity-based compensation awards.\", 'highlights': ''}], '@search.rerankerScore': 1.9208792448043823, 'asset_id': 'a17ef087-cb8a-94a4-c474-bc809124cf1e', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_23.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_23.txt', 'page_number': '23', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_23.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_23.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_23.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with more than36 million active users, including over26 million active mobile users.

For additional information, see Capital Management on page 43.  \\n  \\n  \\n# U.K. Exit from the EU  \\n  \\nWe conduct business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily through our subsidiaries in the U.K. and Ireland. A referendum held in the U.K. in 2016 resulted in a majority vote in favor of exiting the European Union (EU). In March 2017, the U.K. notified the EU of its intent to withdraw from the EU, which is scheduled to occur on March 29, 2019. Negotiations between the U.K. and the EU regarding the terms, conditions and timing of the withdrawal are ongoing and the outcome remains uncertain. In preparation for the withdrawal, we have implemented changes to our operating model in the region, including establishing our principal EU banking and broker-dealer operations outside the U.K. The changes are expected to enable us to continue to service our clients with minimal disruption, retain operational flexibility, minimize transition risks and maximize legal entity efficiencies, independent of the outcome and timing of the withdrawal.  \\n  \\n  \\n# LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates  \\n  \\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. This announcement along with financial benchmark reforms more generally and changes in the interbank lending markets have resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR and certain other rates or indices used as interest rate \"benchmarks.\" These actions and uncertainties may trigger future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks or lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks.  \\n  \\nThe Corporation has established an enterprise-wide initiative to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the potential discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including LIBOR, and the transition to alternative reference rates. As part of this initiative, the Corporation is actively engaged with global regulators, industry working groups and trade associations to develop strategies for transitions from current benchmarks to alternative reference rates. We are updating our operational processes and models to support new alternative reference rate  \\n  \\nactivity. In addition, we continue to analyze and evaluate legacy contracts across all products to determine the impact of adiscontinuation of LIBOR or other benchmarks and to address consequential changes to those legacy contracts. Certain actions required to mitigate risks associated with the unavailability of benchmarks and implementation of new methodologies and contractual mechanics are dependent on a consensus being reached by the industry or the markets in various jurisdictions around the world. As a result, there is uncertainty as to the solutions that will be developed to address the unavailability of LIBOR or other benchmarks, as well as the overall impact to our businesses, operations and results. Additionally, any transition from current benchmarks may alter the Corporation\\'s risk profiles and models, valuation tools, product design and effectiveness of hedging strategies, as well as increase the costs and risks related to potential regulatory requirements.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Financial Highlights  \\n  \\n  \\n## Table 1 Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data  \\n  \\n| (Dollars in millions, except per share information) | 2018 | 2017 |  \\n| - | - | - |  \\n| Income statement | | |  \\n| Net interest income | $ 47,432 | $ 44,667 |  \\n| Noninterest income | 43,815 | 42,685 |  \\n| Total revenue, net of interest expense | 91,247 | 87,352 |  \\n| Provision for credit losses | 3,282 | 3,396 |  \\n| Noninterest expense | 53,381 | 54,743 |  \\n| Income before income taxes | 34,584 | 29,213 |  \\n| Income tax expense | 6,437 | 10,981 |  \\n| Net income | 28,147 | 18,232 |  \\n| Preferred stock dividends | 1,451 | 1,614 |  \\n| Net income applicable to common shareholders | $ 26,696 | $ 16,618 |  \\n| Per common share information | | |  \\n| Earnings | 2.64 | 1.63 |  \\n| Diluted earnings | 2.61 | 1.56 |  \\n| Dividends paid | 0.54 | 0.39 |  \\n| Performance ratios | | |  \\n| Return on average assets | 1.21 % | 0.80 % |  \\n| Return on average common shareholders\\' equity | 11.04 | 6.72 |  \\n| Return on average tangible common shareholders\\' equity (1) | 15.55 | 9.41 |  \\n| Efficiency ratio | 58.50 | 62.67 |  \\n| Balance sheet at year end | | |  \\n| Total loans and leases | $ 946,895 | $ 936,749 |  \\n| Total assets | 2,354,507 | 2,281,234 |  \\n| Total deposits | 1,381,476 | 1,309,545 |  \\n| Total common shareholders\\' equity | 242,999 | 244,823 |  \\n| Total shareholders\\' equity | 265,325 | 267,146 |  \\n  \\n(1) Return on average tangible common shareholders\\' equity is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The improvement in net income was driven by a decrease in income tax expense due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), an increase in net interest income, higher noninterest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense. Impacts from the Tax Act include a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. In addition, results for 2017 included a reduction in net income of $2.9 billion due to the Tax Act, driven largely by a lower valuation of certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"21 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.010526316240429878, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) - A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: \"well capitalized,\" \"adequately capitalized,\" \"undercapitalized,\" \"significantly undercapitalized\" and \"critically undercapitalized.\"', 'highlights': 'Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) - A framework established by the U.S.<em> banking</em> regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: \"well capitalized,\" \"adequately capitalized,\" \"undercapitalized,\" \"significantly undercapitalized\" and \"critically undercapitalized.\"'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 1.7690333127975464, 'asset_id': '1812dc44-7470-49b9-0b3b-ddac55ccad53', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_182.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_182.txt', 'page_number': '182', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_182.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_182.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_182.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'Glossary  \\n  \\nAlt-A Mortgage - A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or \"prime,\" and less risky than \"subprime,\" the riskiest category.

AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.  \\n  \\nBanking Book - All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.  \\n  \\nBrokerage and Other Assets - Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.  \\n  \\nCommitted Credit Exposure - Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.  \\n  \\nCredit Derivatives - Contractual agreements that provide protection against a specified credit event on one or more referenced obligations.  \\n  \\nCredit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) - A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments.  \\n  \\nDebit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) - A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation\\'s own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities.  \\n  \\nFunding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) - A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives.  \\n  \\nInterest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) - Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.  \\n  \\nLetter of Credit - A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer\\'s credit for that of the customer.  \\n  \\nLoan-to-value (LTV) - A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan.  \\n  \\nMargin Receivable - An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.  \\n  \\nMatched Book - Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity.

Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.  \\n  \\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) - VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data.

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.  \\n  \\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.  \\n  \\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.  \\n  \\nDuring 2018, there were three days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Total Trading-related Revenue  \\n  \\nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading- related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.  \\n  \\nThe following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2018 and 2017. During 2018, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 79 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to 2017 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 77 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.  \\n  \\n<figure>  \\n  \\n![](figures/0)  \\n  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Histogram of Daily Trading-related Revenue 160 140 120 Number of Days 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 -25 to 0 0 to 25 25 to 50 50 to 75 75 to 100 greater than 100 Revenue (dollars in millions) DYear Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n</figure>  \\n  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"73 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.016129031777381897, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products. · Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production.', 'highlights': 'Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in<em> equities,</em> partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products. · Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production.'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 1.9106348752975464, 'asset_id': 'd6ed313f-b5a0-d93a-f302-cd12b7418897', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.txt', 'page_number': '85', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'See Note 19 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information. For more information, see page 13 under Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulatory, Compliance and Legal  \\n  \\n  \\n# Goodwill and Intangible Assets  \\n  \\nThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Beginning with our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment, rather than a quantitative assessment as previously performed, that is more fully described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. We performed that test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered in the qualitative assessments include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed.  \\n  \\nBased on our qualitative assessments, we determined that for each reporting unit with goodwill, it was more likely than not that its respective fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating there was no impairment. For more information regarding goodwill balances at June 30, 2018, see Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Representations and Warranties Liability  \\n  \\nThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the type of representations and warranties provided in the sales contracts and considers a variety of factors. These factors, which incorporate judgment, are subject to change based on our specific experience. Our experience in negotiating settlements with trustees and other counterparties is an important input in determining our estimate of the liability. We also consider actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Changes to any one of these factors could impact the estimate of our liability.  \\n  \\nThe representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $200 million in the representations and warranties liability as ofDecember 31, 2018. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.  \\n  \\nFor more information on representations and warranties exposure, seeNote 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"79 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n  \\n## 2017 Compared to 2016  \\n  \\nThe following discussion and analysis provide a comparison of our results of operations for 2017 and 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Overview  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Income  \\n  \\nNet income was $18.2 billion, or $1.56 per diluted share in2017 compared to $17.8 billion, or $1.49 per diluted share in2016. The results for 2017 included a charge of $2.9 billion related to the Tax Act. The pretax results for 2017 compared to 2016 were driven by higher revenue, largely the result of an increase in net interest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Interest Income  \\n  \\nNet interest income increased $3.6 billion to $44.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net interest yield on an FTE basis increased 12 bps to 2.37 percent for 2017. These increases were primarily driven by the benefits from higher interest rates and loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in the second quarter of 2017.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Income  \\n  \\nNoninterest income increased $80 million to $42.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. The following highlights the significant changes.  \\n  \\n· Service charges increased $180 million primarily driven by the impact of pricing strategies and higher treasury services related revenue.  \\n  \\n· Investment and brokerage services income increased $487 million primarily driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing.  \\n  \\nInvestment banking income increased $770 million primarily due to higher advisory fees and higher debt and equity issuance fees.  \\n  \\n. Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products.  \\n  \\n· Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production. Included in 2017 was a $793 million pretax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Provision for Credit Losses  \\n  \\nThe provision for credit losses decreased $201 million to $3.4 billion for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reductions in energy exposures in the commercial portfolio and credit quality improvements in the consumer real estate portfolio. This was partially offset by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio and a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Expense  \\n  \\nNoninterest expense decreased $340 million to $54.7 billion for 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating costs, a reduction from the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and lower litigation expense, partially offset by a $316 million impairment charge related to certain data centers that were in the process of being sold and  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.015625, '@search.captions': [{'text': \"Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $19 million due to higher Equities revenue, largely offset by lower FICC revenue.

These increases were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Wealth & Investment Management  \\n  \\nNet income for GWIM increased $312 million to $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $414 million to $6.2 billion driven by higher short- term interest rates. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $526 million to $12.4 billion. The increase in noninterest income was driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing. Noninterest expense increased $390 million to $13.6 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related incentive costs.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Banking  \\n  \\nNet income for Global Banking increased $1.2 billion to $7.0 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by higher revenue and lower  \\n  \\nprovision for credit losses. Revenue increased $1.6 billion to$20.0 billion driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income increased $1.0 billion to $10.5 billion due to loan and deposit-related growth, higher short-term rates on an increased deposit base and the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, partially offset by credit spread compression. Noninterest income increased $521 million to $9.5 billion largely due to higher investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses decreased $671 million to $212 million in 2017 primarily driven by reductions in energy exposures and continued portfolio improvement, partially offset by Global Banking\\'s portion of a 2017 single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off. Noninterest expense increased $110 million to $8.6 billion in 2017 primarily driven by higher investments in technology and higher deposit insurance, partially offset by lower litigation costs.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Markets  \\n  \\nNet income for Global Markets decreased $524 million to $3.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net DVA losses were $428 million compared to losses of $238 million in 2016. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $405 million to $3.6 billion primarily driven by higher noninterest expense, lower sales and trading revenue and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher investment banking fees. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $423 million primarily due to weaker performance in rates products and emerging markets. The provision for credit losses increased $133 million to $164 million in 2017, reflecting Global Markets\\' portion of a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off. Noninterest expense increased $560 million to $10.7 billion primarily due to higher litigation expense and continued investments in technology.  \\n  \\n  \\n## All Other  \\n  \\nThe net loss for All Other increased $1.6 billion to a net loss of$3.3 billion, driven by a charge of $2.9 billion due to enactment of the Tax Act. The pretax loss for 2017 compared to 2016 decreased $523 million reflecting lower noninterest expense and a larger benefit in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in revenue. Revenue declined $1.5 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income. All other noninterest loss decreased marginally and included a pretax gain of $793 million on the sale of the non-U.S. credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act.  \\n  \\nThe benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $461 million to a benefit of $561 million primarily driven by continued runoff of the non-core portfolio, loan sale recoveries and the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business.  \\n  \\nNoninterest expense decreased $1.5 billion to$4.1 billion driven by lower litigation expense, lower personnel expense and a decline in non-core mortgage servicing costs.  \\n  \\nThe income tax benefit was $1.0 billion in 2017 compared to a benefit of $3.1 billion in 2016. The decrease in the tax benefit was driven by the impacts of the Tax Act. Both periods include income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bank of America 2018 80\" -->  \\n'}]\n",

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.  \\n  \\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.  \\n  \\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.  \\n  \\nDuring 2018, there were three days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Total Trading-related Revenue  \\n  \\nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading- related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.  \\n  \\nThe following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2018 and 2017. During 2018, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 79 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to 2017 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 77 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.  \\n  \\n<figure>  \\n  \\n![](figures/0)  \\n  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Histogram of Daily Trading-related Revenue 160 140 120 Number of Days 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 -25 to 0 0 to 25 25 to 50 50 to 75 75 to 100 greater than 100 Revenue (dollars in millions) DYear Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n</figure>  \\n  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"73 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.016129031777381897, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products. · Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production.', 'highlights': 'Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in<em> equities,</em> partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products. · Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production.'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 1.9106348752975464, 'asset_id': 'd6ed313f-b5a0-d93a-f302-cd12b7418897', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.txt', 'page_number': '85', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'See Note 19 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information.

Beginning with our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment, rather than a quantitative assessment as previously performed, that is more fully described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. We performed that test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered in the qualitative assessments include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed.  \\n  \\nBased on our qualitative assessments, we determined that for each reporting unit with goodwill, it was more likely than not that its respective fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating there was no impairment. For more information regarding goodwill balances at June 30, 2018, see Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Representations and Warranties Liability  \\n  \\nThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the type of representations and warranties provided in the sales contracts and considers a variety of factors. These factors, which incorporate judgment, are subject to change based on our specific experience. Our experience in negotiating settlements with trustees and other counterparties is an important input in determining our estimate of the liability. We also consider actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Changes to any one of these factors could impact the estimate of our liability.  \\n  \\nThe representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $200 million in the representations and warranties liability as ofDecember 31, 2018. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.  \\n  \\nFor more information on representations and warranties exposure, seeNote 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"79 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n  \\n## 2017 Compared to 2016  \\n  \\nThe following discussion and analysis provide a comparison of our results of operations for 2017 and 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Overview  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Income  \\n  \\nNet income was $18.2 billion, or $1.56 per diluted share in2017 compared to $17.8 billion, or $1.49 per diluted share in2016. The results for 2017 included a charge of $2.9 billion related to the Tax Act. The pretax results for 2017 compared to 2016 were driven by higher revenue, largely the result of an increase in net interest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Interest Income  \\n  \\nNet interest income increased $3.6 billion to $44.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net interest yield on an FTE basis increased 12 bps to 2.37 percent for 2017. These increases were primarily driven by the benefits from higher interest rates and loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in the second quarter of 2017.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Income  \\n  \\nNoninterest income increased $80 million to $42.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. The following highlights the significant changes.  \\n  \\n· Service charges increased $180 million primarily driven by the impact of pricing strategies and higher treasury services related revenue.  \\n  \\n· Investment and brokerage services income increased $487 million primarily driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing.  \\n  \\nInvestment banking income increased $770 million primarily due to higher advisory fees and higher debt and equity issuance fees.  \\n  \\n. Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products.  \\n  \\n· Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production. Included in 2017 was a $793 million pretax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Provision for Credit Losses  \\n  \\nThe provision for credit losses decreased $201 million to $3.4 billion for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reductions in energy exposures in the commercial portfolio and credit quality improvements in the consumer real estate portfolio.

Noninterest income decreased $227 million to $10.2 billion driven by lower mortgage banking income, partially offset by higher card income and service charges. The provision for credit losses increased $810 million to $3.5 billion due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $131 million to $17.8 billion driven by higher personnel expense, including the shared success discretionary year-end bonus, and increased FDIC expense, as well as investments in digital capabilities and business growth.

Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $526 million to $12.4 billion. The increase in noninterest income was driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing.

Net interest income increased $1.0 billion to $10.5 billion due to loan and deposit-related growth, higher short-term rates on an increased deposit base and the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, partially offset by credit spread compression. Noninterest income increased $521 million to $9.5 billion largely due to higher investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses decreased $671 million to $212 million in 2017 primarily driven by reductions in energy exposures and continued portfolio improvement, partially offset by Global Banking\\'s portion of a 2017 single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off.

These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense that is recorded on the hedged item.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Gains and Losses on Other Risk Management Derivatives  \\n  \\n| (Dollars in millions) | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 |  \\n| - | - | - | - |  \\n| Interest rate risk on mortgage activities (1) | $ (107) | $ 8 | 461 |  \\n| Credit risk on loans | 9 | (6 | (107) |  \\n| Interest rate and foreign currency risk on ALM activities (2) | 1,010 | (36) | (754) |  \\n  \\n(1) Primarily related to hedges of interest rate risk on MSRs and IRLCs to originate mortgage loans that will be held for sale.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had transferred $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed MBS to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion at the transfer dates. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of the transferred securities was $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Sales and Trading Revenue  \\n  \\nThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation\\'s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\\'s Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items including trading account profits and net interest income as well as other revenue categories.  \\n  \\nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the \"Other\" column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in trading account profits. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in trading account profits. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of  \\n  \\nthe instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in trading account profits as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in trading account profits. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.  \\n  \\nThe table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation\\'s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for 2018, 2017 and 2016. The difference between total trading account profits in the following table and in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents trading activities in business segments other than Global Markets.

Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"105\" -->  \\n'}]\n",

FICC revenue decreased $723 million in 2018 primarily due to lower activity and a less favorable market in credit-related products. The decline in FICC revenue was also impacted by higher funding costs, which were driven by increases in market interest rates. Equities revenue increased $742 million in 2018 driven by strength in client financing and derivatives.  \\n  \\n  \\n# All Other  \\n  \\n| (Dollars in millions) | 2018 | 2017 | % Change |  \\n| - | - | - | - |  \\n| Net interest income | $ 573 | $ 864 | (34)% |  \\n| Noninterest income (loss) | (1,284) | (1,648) | (22) |  \\n| Total revenue, net of interest expense | (711) | (784) | (9) |  \\n| Provision for credit losses | (476) | (561) | (15) |  \\n| Noninterest expense | 2,614 | 4,065 | (36) |  \\n| Loss before income taxes | (2,849) | (4,288) | (34) |  \\n| Income tax benefit | (2,736) | (979) | n/m |  \\n| Net loss | $ (113) | $ (3,309) | (97) |  \\n| Balance Sheet | | | |  \\n| Average | | | |  \\n| Total loans and leases | $ 61,013 | $ 82,489 | (26)% |  \\n| Total assets (1) | 201,298 | 206,999 | (3) |  \\n| Total deposits | 21,966 | 25,194 | (13) |  \\n| Year end | | | |  \\n| Total loans and leases | 48,061 | $ 69,452 | (31)% |  \\n| Total assets (1) | 196,325 | 194,042 | 1 |  \\n| Total deposits | 18,541 | 22,719 | (18) |  \\n  \\n(1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets fromAll Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders\\' equity.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had transferred $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed MBS to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion at the transfer dates. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of the transferred securities was $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Sales and Trading Revenue  \\n  \\nThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation\\'s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\\'s Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items including trading account profits and net interest income as well as other revenue categories.  \\n  \\nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the \"Other\" column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in trading account profits. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in trading account profits. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of  \\n  \\nthe instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in trading account profits as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in trading account profits. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.  \\n  \\nThe table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation\\'s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for 2018, 2017 and 2016. The difference between total trading account profits in the following table and in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents trading activities in business segments other than Global Markets.

Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"105\" -->  \\n'}]}\n",

Additional information related to our business segments and the products and services they provide is included in the information set forth on pages 30 through 39 of Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 23 - Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Competition  \\n  \\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit card issuers, mutual fund companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, and e-commerce and other internet-based companies. We compete with some of these competitors globally and with others on a regional or product specific basis.  \\n  \\nCompetition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates on loans and deposits, lending limits and customer convenience. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Employees  \\n  \\nAt December 31, 2018, we had approximately 204,000 employees. None of our domestic employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers our employee relations to be good.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Government Supervision and Regulation  \\n  \\nThe following discussion describes, among other things, elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies, banks and broker-dealers, including specific information about Bank of America.  \\n  \\nWe are subject to an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies and banks and other financial services entities. U.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors.  \\n  \\nAs a registered financial holding company and BHC, the Corporation is subject to the supervision of, and regular inspection by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank subsidiaries (the Banks) organized as national banking associations are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. U.S. financial holding companies, and the companies under their control, are permitted to engage in activities considered \"financial in nature\" as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve interpretations. Unless otherwise limited by the Federal Reserve, a financial holding company may engage directly or indirectly in activities considered financial in nature provided the financial holding company gives the Federal Reserve after-the-fact notice of the new activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also permits national banks to engage in activities considered financial in nature through a financial subsidiary, subject to certain conditions and limitations and with the approval of the OCC.  \\n  \\nThe scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. In addition, the banking and financial services sector is subject to substantial regulatory enforcement and fines. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform Act). We cannot assess whether there will be any additional major changes in the regulatory environment and expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.  \\n  \\nWe are also subject to various other laws and regulations, as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our operations and management and our ability to make distributions to shareholders. For instance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to both U.S. and international regulation, including supervision by the SEC, New York Stock Exchange and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, among others; our commodities businesses in the U.S. are subject to regulation by and supervision of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); our U.S. derivatives activity is subject to regulation and supervision of the CFTC, National Futures Association and SEC, and in the case of the Banks, certain banking regulators; our insurance activities are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance regulatory agencies; and our consumer financial products and services are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  \\n  \\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, prudential regulators, central banks and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. For example, our financial services operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.) are subject to regulation by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bank of America 2018 2\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.015384615398943424, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the u.s. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: consumer banking, global wealth & investment management (gwim), global banking and global markets, with the remaining …', 'highlights': 'through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the u.s. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments:<em> consumer banking, global wealth</em> & investment management (gwim), global banking and global markets, with the remaining …'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 2.889399528503418, 'asset_id': '8ceda12a-42c4-1040-782b-81fca671b4d2', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_22.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_22.txt', 'page_number': '22', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_22.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_22.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_22.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  \\n===  \\n  \\nBank of America Corporation (the \"Corporation\") and its management may make certain statements that constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Consumer Banking product offerings include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, checking accounts, and investment accounts and products, as well as credit and debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans to consumers and small businesses in the U.S. Consumer Banking includes the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans in the core portfolio.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Wealth & Investment Management  \\n  \\nGWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets, including tailored solutions to meet clients\\' needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products. GWIM also provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients\\' wealth structuring, investment  \\n  \\nmanagement, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Banking  \\n  \\nGlobal Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services through the Corporation\\'s network of offices and client relationship teams. Global Banking also provides investment banking products to clients. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking clients generally include middle- market companies, commercial real estate firms, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations, financial institutions, leasing clients, and mid-sized U.S .- based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Markets  \\n  \\nGlobal Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets also works with commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products. As a result of market-making activities, Global Markets may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products. In addition, the economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue- sharing arrangement.  \\n  \\n  \\n## All Other  \\n  \\nAll Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, the net impact of periodic revisions to the MSR valuation model for core and non-core MSRs and the related economic hedge results, liquidating businesses and residual expense allocations. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and hedge ineffectiveness. The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to the business segments. Equity investments include the merchant services joint venture as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments.  \\n  \\n  \\n### Basis of Presentation  \\n  \\nThe management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.  \\n  \\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income.

The expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid for the loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is recorded as interest income over the remaining estimated life of the loan or pool of loans. The excess of the contractual principal and interest over the expected cash flows of the PCI loans is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. If, upon subsequent valuation, the Corporation determines it is probable that the present value of the expected cash flows has decreased, a charge to the provision for credit losses is recorded. If it is probable that there is a significant increase in the present value of expected cash flows, the allowance for credit losses is reduced or, if there is no remaining allowance for credit losses related to these PCI loans, the accretable yield is increased through a reclassification from nonaccretable difference, resulting in a prospective increase in interest income. Reclassifications to or from nonaccretable difference can also occur for changes in the estimated lives of the PCI loans. If a loan within a PCI pool is sold, foreclosed, forgiven or the expectation of any future proceeds is remote, the loan is removed from the pool at its proportional carrying value. If the loan\\'s recovery value is less than its carrying value, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool\\'s nonaccretable difference and then against the allowance for credit losses.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Leases  \\n  \\nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases, are reported net of non-recourse debt. Unearned income on leveraged and direct financing leases is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Allowance for Credit Losses  \\n  \\nThe allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management\\'s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the Corporation\\'s loan and lease portfolio excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option. The allowance for credit losses includes both quantitative and qualitative components. The qualitative component has a higher degree of management subjectivity, and includes factors such as concentrations, economic conditions and other considerations. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents the estimated probable credit losses on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases while the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments, represents estimated probable credit losses o  \\n  \\nn these unfunded credit instruments based on utilization assumptions. Lending- related credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible, excluding loans carried at fair value, are charged off against these accounts.  \\n  \\nThe Corporation performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios. The allowance on certain homogeneous consumer loan portfolios, which generally consist of consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment and credit card loans within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment, is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized for these portfolios which consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, bankruptcies, economic conditions, credit scores and the amount of loss in the event of default.  \\n  \\nFor consumer loans secured by residential real estate, using statistical modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default based on the individual loan attributes aggregated into pools of homogeneous loans with similar attributes. The attributes that are most significant to the probability of default and are used to estimate defaults include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination (referred to as vintage) and geography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). The severity or loss given default is estimated based on the refreshed LTV for first-lien mortgages or CLTV for subordinated liens. The estimates are based on the Corporation\\'s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect an assessment of environmental factors not yet reflected in the historical data underlying the loss estimates, such as changes in real estate values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and the regulatory environment. The probability of default models also incorporate recent experience with modification programs including re- defaults subsequent to modification, a loan\\'s default history prior to modification and the change in borrower payments post-modification. On home equity loans where the Corporation holds only a second-lien position and foreclosure is not the best alternative, the loss severity is estimated at 100 percent.  \\n  \\nThe allowance on certain commercial loans (except business card and certain small business loans) is calculated using loss rates delineated by risk rating and product type. Factors considered when assessing loss rates include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry of the obligor, and the obligor\\'s liquidity and other financial indicators along with certain qualitative factors. These statistical models are updated regularly for changes in economic and business conditions. Included in the analysis of consumer and commercial loan portfolios are qualitative estimates which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect the Corporation\\'s estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty and large single-name defaults.  \\n  \\nFor individually impaired loans, which include nonperforming commercial loans as well as consumer and commercial loans and leases modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR), management measures impairment primarily based on the present value of payments expected to be received, discounted at the loans\\' original effective contractual interest rates. Credit card loans are discounted at the portfolio average contractual annual percentage rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Impaired loans and TDRs may also be  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"95 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}]\n",

Additional information related to our business segments and the products and services they provide is included in the information set forth on pages 30 through 39 of Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 23 - Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Competition  \\n  \\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit card issuers, mutual fund companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, and e-commerce and other internet-based companies. We compete with some of these competitors globally and with others on a regional or product specific basis.  \\n  \\nCompetition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates on loans and deposits, lending limits and customer convenience. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Employees  \\n  \\nAt December 31, 2018, we had approximately 204,000 employees. None of our domestic employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers our employee relations to be good.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Government Supervision and Regulation  \\n  \\nThe following discussion describes, among other things, elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies, banks and broker-dealers, including specific information about Bank of America.  \\n  \\nWe are subject to an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies and banks and other financial services entities. U.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors.  \\n  \\nAs a registered financial holding company and BHC, the Corporation is subject to the supervision of, and regular inspection by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank subsidiaries (the Banks) organized as national banking associations are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. U.S. financial holding companies, and the companies under their control, are permitted to engage in activities considered \"financial in nature\" as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve interpretations. Unless otherwise limited by the Federal Reserve, a financial holding company may engage directly or indirectly in activities considered financial in nature provided the financial holding company gives the Federal Reserve after-the-fact notice of the new activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also permits national banks to engage in activities considered financial in nature through a financial subsidiary, subject to certain conditions and limitations and with the approval of the OCC.  \\n  \\nThe scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. In addition, the banking and financial services sector is subject to substantial regulatory enforcement and fines. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform Act). We cannot assess whether there will be any additional major changes in the regulatory environment and expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.  \\n  \\nWe are also subject to various other laws and regulations, as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our operations and management and our ability to make distributions to shareholders. For instance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to both U.S. and international regulation, including supervision by the SEC, New York Stock Exchange and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, among others; our commodities businesses in the U.S. are subject to regulation by and supervision of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); our U.S. derivatives activity is subject to regulation and supervision of the CFTC, National Futures Association and SEC, and in the case of the Banks, certain banking regulators; our insurance activities are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance regulatory agencies; and our consumer financial products and services are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  \\n  \\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, prudential regulators, central banks and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. For example, our financial services operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.) are subject to regulation by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bank of America 2018 2\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.015384615398943424, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the u.s. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: consumer banking, global wealth & investment management (gwim), global banking and global markets, with the remaining …', 'highlights': 'through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the u.s. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments:<em> consumer banking, global wealth</em> & investment management (gwim), global banking and global markets, with the remaining …'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 2.889399528503418, 'asset_id': '8ceda12a-42c4-1040-782b-81fca671b4d2', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_22.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_22.txt', 'page_number': '22', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_22.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_22.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_22.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  \\n===  \\n  \\nBank of America Corporation (the \"Corporation\") and its management may make certain statements that constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Equity investments include the merchant services joint venture as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments.  \\n  \\n  \\n### Basis of Presentation  \\n  \\nThe management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.  \\n  \\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income.

The Corporation\\'sthree portfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity. The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment are U.S. credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business commercial.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Purchased Credit-impaired Loans  \\n  \\nAt acquisition, purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans are recorded at fair value with no allowance for credit losses, and accounted for individually or aggregated in pools based on similar risk characteristics. The expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid for the loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is recorded as interest income over the remaining estimated life of the loan or pool of loans. The excess of the contractual principal and interest over the expected cash flows of the PCI loans is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. If, upon subsequent valuation, the Corporation determines it is probable that the present value of the expected cash flows has decreased, a charge to the provision for credit losses is recorded. If it is probable that there is a significant increase in the present value of expected cash flows, the allowance for credit losses is reduced or, if there is no remaining allowance for credit losses related to these PCI loans, the accretable yield is increased through a reclassification from nonaccretable difference, resulting in a prospective increase in interest income. Reclassifications to or from nonaccretable difference can also occur for changes in the estimated lives of the PCI loans. If a loan within a PCI pool is sold, foreclosed, forgiven or the expectation of any future proceeds is remote, the loan is removed from the pool at its proportional carrying value. If the loan\\'s recovery value is less than its carrying value, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool\\'s nonaccretable difference and then against the allowance for credit losses.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Leases  \\n  \\nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases, are reported net of non-recourse debt. Unearned income on leveraged and direct financing leases is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Allowance for Credit Losses  \\n  \\nThe allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management\\'s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the Corporation\\'s loan and lease portfolio excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option. The allowance for credit losses includes both quantitative and qualitative components. The qualitative component has a higher degree of management subjectivity, and includes factors such as concentrations, economic conditions and other considerations. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents the estimated probable credit losses on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases while the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments, represents estimated probable credit losses o  \\n  \\nn these unfunded credit instruments based on utilization assumptions. Lending- related credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible, excluding loans carried at fair value, are charged off against these accounts.  \\n  \\nThe Corporation performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios. The allowance on certain homogeneous consumer loan portfolios, which generally consist of consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment and credit card loans within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment, is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized for these portfolios which consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, bankruptcies, economic conditions, credit scores and the amount of loss in the event of default.  \\n  \\nFor consumer loans secured by residential real estate, using statistical modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default based on the individual loan attributes aggregated into pools of homogeneous loans with similar attributes. The attributes that are most significant to the probability of default and are used to estimate defaults include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination (referred to as vintage) and geography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). The severity or loss given default is estimated based on the refreshed LTV for first-lien mortgages or CLTV for subordinated liens. The estimates are based on the Corporation\\'s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect an assessment of environmental factors not yet reflected in the historical data underlying the loss estimates, such as changes in real estate values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and the regulatory environment. The probability of default models also incorporate recent experience with modification programs including re- defaults subsequent to modification, a loan\\'s default history prior to modification and the change in borrower payments post-modification. On home equity loans where the Corporation holds only a second-lien position and foreclosure is not the best alternative, the loss severity is estimated at 100 percent.  \\n  \\nThe allowance on certain commercial loans (except business card and certain small business loans) is calculated using loss rates delineated by risk rating and product type. Factors considered when assessing loss rates include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry of the obligor, and the obligor\\'s liquidity and other financial indicators along with certain qualitative factors. These statistical models are updated regularly for changes in economic and business conditions. Included in the analysis of consumer and commercial loan portfolios are qualitative estimates which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect the Corporation\\'s estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty and large single-name defaults.  \\n  \\nFor individually impaired loans, which include nonperforming commercial loans as well as consumer and commercial loans and leases modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR), management measures impairment primarily based on the present value of payments expected to be received, discounted at the loans\\' original effective contractual interest rates. Credit card loans are discounted at the portfolio average contractual annual percentage rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Impaired loans and TDRs may also be  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"95 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}]}\n",

Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC, either as a result of default of a bank subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default, the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the FDIC\\'s loss, subject to certain exceptions.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Transactions with Affiliates  \\n  \\nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve\\'s Regulation W, the Banks are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between the Banks and their nonbank affiliates. In general, U.S. banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving its nonbank affiliates. Additionally, transactions between U.S. banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on arm\\'s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Deposit Insurance  \\n  \\nDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC\\'s regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits are $250,000 per customer. All insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in order to fund the DIF.  \\n  \\nThe FDIC is required to maintain at least a designated minimum ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the U.S. The Financial Reform Act requires the FDIC to assess insured depository institutions to achieve a DIF ratio of at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020. In November 2018, the FDIC announced that the DIF ratio exceeded 1.35 in advance of the deadline and that the related surcharges ceased. Additionally, the FDIC adopted regulations that establish a long-term target DIF ratio of greater than two percent. As of the date of this report, the DIF ratio is below this required target and the FDIC has adopted a restoration plan that may result in increased deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. For more information regarding deposit insurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulatory, Compliance and Legal on page 13.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Capital, Liquidity and Operational Requirements  \\n  \\nAs a financial holding company, we and our bank subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, including the FDIC and the OCC. These rules are complex and are evolving as U.S. and international regulatory authorities propose and enact enhanced capital and liquidity rules. The Corporation seeks to manage its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to meet these regulatory guidelines and to support our business activities. These evolving rules are likely to influence our planning processes and may require additional regulatory capital and liquidity, as well as impose additional operational and compliance costs on the Corporation. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design, implementation and board oversight of BHCs\\' and national  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"3 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\nbanks\\' risk governance frameworks. The Federal Reserve also issued a final rule, which became effective January 1, 2019, that includes minimum external total loss- absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt requirements.  \\n  \\nFor more information on regulatory capital rules, capital composition and pending or proposed regulatory capital changes, see Capital Management - Regulatory Capital in the MD&A on page 44, and Note 16 - Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated by reference in this Item 1.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Distributions  \\n  \\nWe are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital actions, including payment of dividends and common stock repurchases. For instance, Federal Reserve regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The purpose of the CCAR for the Federal Reserve is to assess the capital planning process of the BHC, including any planned capital actions, such as payment of dividends and common stock repurchases.  \\n  \\nOur ability to pay dividends is also affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and non-capital standards established under the FDICIA. The right of the Corporation, our shareholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries is further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries.  \\n  \\nIf the Federal Reserve finds that any of our Banks are not \"well-capitalized\" or \"well-managed,\" we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. Additionally, the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or BHC, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof.  \\n  \\nFor more information regarding the requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including the minimum capital requirements, see Note 13 - Shareholders\\' Equity and Note 16 - Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Resolution Planning  \\n  \\nAs a BHC with greater than $50 billion of assets, the Corporation is required by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.  \\n  \\nSuch resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the BHC and its material entities pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable resolution regimes under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance.  \\n  \\nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that the BHC\\'s plan is not credible, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations.

The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets.  \\n  \\nIn consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets. The aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the parent company to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash needs. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent company becomes imminent.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets  \\n  \\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker- dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.  \\n  \\nTable 17 presents average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.  \\n  \\nTable 17 Average Global Liquidity Sources  \\n  \\n| (Dollars in billions) | Three Months Ended December 31 ||  \\n|| 2018 | 2017 |  \\n| - | - | - |  \\n| Parent company and NB Holdings | $ 76 | $ 79 |  \\n| Bank subsidiaries | 420 | 394 |  \\n| Other regulated entities | 48 | 49 |  \\n| Total Average Global Liquidity Sources | $ 544 | $ 522 |  \\n  \\nTypically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA.  \\n  \\nOur bank subsidiaries\\' liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $344 billion and $308 billion at December 31,  \\n  \\n2018 and 2017. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.  \\n  \\nLiquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.  \\n  \\nTable 18 presents the composition of average GLS for thethree months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.  \\n  \\nTable 18 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition  \\n  \\n| (Dollars in billions) | Three Months Ended December 31 ||  \\n|| 2018 | 2017 |  \\n| - | - | - |  \\n| Cash on deposit | $ 113 | $ 118 |  \\n| U.S. Treasury securities | 81 | 62 |  \\n| U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities | 340 | 330 |  \\n| Non-U.S. government securities | 10 | 12 |  \\n| Total Average Global Liquidity Sources | $ 544 | $ 522 |  \\n  \\nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution\\'s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $446 billion and $439 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was118 percent and 125 percent.

Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding payment network\\'s rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card partner\\'s members or customers on behalf of the Corporation.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Service Charges  \\n  \\nService charges include deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial  \\n  \\ndeposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money order processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation\\'s Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and treasury management services, including account maintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Investment and Brokerage Services  \\n  \\nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are earned from the management of client assets under advisory agreements or the full discretion of the Corporation\\'s financial advisors (collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of the client\\'s AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps) to 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a client\\'s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.  \\n  \\nBrokerage fees include income earned from transaction-based services that are performed as part of investment management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and sales commissions that are primarily in the  \\n  \\nGlobal Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Investment Banking Income  \\n  \\nInvestment banking income includes underwriting income and financial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees earned for the placement of a customer\\'s debt or equity securities. The revenue is generally earned based on a percentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed. Once the number of shares or notes is determined and the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in performing these services. These expenses are recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan syndication.  \\n  \\nFinancial advisory services consist of fees earned for assisting customers with transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies depending on the size and number of services performed for each contract and is generally contingent on successful execution of the transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the customer.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies  \\n  \\nThe Corporation did not disclose the value of any open performance obligations at December 31, 2018, as its contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is less thanone year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Earnings Per Common Share  \\n  \\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding, excluding unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income allocated to common shareholders is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"99\" -->  \\n'}]\n",

Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC, either as a result of default of a bank subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default, the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the FDIC\\'s loss, subject to certain exceptions.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Transactions with Affiliates  \\n  \\nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve\\'s Regulation W, the Banks are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between the Banks and their nonbank affiliates. In general, U.S. banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving its nonbank affiliates. Additionally, transactions between U.S. banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on arm\\'s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Deposit Insurance  \\n  \\nDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC\\'s regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits are $250,000 per customer. All insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in order to fund the DIF.  \\n  \\nThe FDIC is required to maintain at least a designated minimum ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the U.S. The Financial Reform Act requires the FDIC to assess insured depository institutions to achieve a DIF ratio of at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020. In November 2018, the FDIC announced that the DIF ratio exceeded 1.35 in advance of the deadline and that the related surcharges ceased. Additionally, the FDIC adopted regulations that establish a long-term target DIF ratio of greater than two percent. As of the date of this report, the DIF ratio is below this required target and the FDIC has adopted a restoration plan that may result in increased deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. For more information regarding deposit insurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulatory, Compliance and Legal on page 13.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Capital, Liquidity and Operational Requirements  \\n  \\nAs a financial holding company, we and our bank subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, including the FDIC and the OCC. These rules are complex and are evolving as U.S. and international regulatory authorities propose and enact enhanced capital and liquidity rules. The Corporation seeks to manage its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to meet these regulatory guidelines and to support our business activities. These evolving rules are likely to influence our planning processes and may require additional regulatory capital and liquidity, as well as impose additional operational and compliance costs on the Corporation. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design, implementation and board oversight of BHCs\\' and national  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"3 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\nbanks\\' risk governance frameworks. The Federal Reserve also issued a final rule, which became effective January 1, 2019, that includes minimum external total loss- absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt requirements.  \\n  \\nFor more information on regulatory capital rules, capital composition and pending or proposed regulatory capital changes, see Capital Management - Regulatory Capital in the MD&A on page 44, and Note 16 - Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated by reference in this Item 1.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Distributions  \\n  \\nWe are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital actions, including payment of dividends and common stock repurchases. For instance, Federal Reserve regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The purpose of the CCAR for the Federal Reserve is to assess the capital planning process of the BHC, including any planned capital actions, such as payment of dividends and common stock repurchases.  \\n  \\nOur ability to pay dividends is also affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and non-capital standards established under the FDICIA. The right of the Corporation, our shareholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries is further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries.  \\n  \\nIf the Federal Reserve finds that any of our Banks are not \"well-capitalized\" or \"well-managed,\" we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. Additionally, the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or BHC, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof.  \\n  \\nFor more information regarding the requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including the minimum capital requirements, see Note 13 - Shareholders\\' Equity and Note 16 - Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Resolution Planning  \\n  \\nAs a BHC with greater than $50 billion of assets, the Corporation is required by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.  \\n  \\nSuch resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the BHC and its material entities pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable resolution regimes under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance.  \\n  \\nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that the BHC\\'s plan is not credible, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations.

The aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the parent company to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash needs. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent company becomes imminent.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets  \\n  \\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker- dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.  \\n  \\nTable 17 presents average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.  \\n  \\nTable 17 Average Global Liquidity Sources  \\n  \\n| (Dollars in billions) | Three Months Ended December 31 ||  \\n|| 2018 | 2017 |  \\n| - | - | - |  \\n| Parent company and NB Holdings | $ 76 | $ 79 |  \\n| Bank subsidiaries | 420 | 394 |  \\n| Other regulated entities | 48 | 49 |  \\n| Total Average Global Liquidity Sources | $ 544 | $ 522 |  \\n  \\nTypically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA.  \\n  \\nOur bank subsidiaries\\' liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $344 billion and $308 billion at December 31,  \\n  \\n2018 and 2017. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.  \\n  \\nLiquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.  \\n  \\nTable 18 presents the composition of average GLS for thethree months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.  \\n  \\nTable 18 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition  \\n  \\n| (Dollars in billions) | Three Months Ended December 31 ||  \\n|| 2018 | 2017 |  \\n| - | - | - |  \\n| Cash on deposit | $ 113 | $ 118 |  \\n| U.S. Treasury securities | 81 | 62 |  \\n| U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities | 340 | 330 |  \\n| Non-U.S. government securities | 10 | 12 |  \\n| Total Average Global Liquidity Sources | $ 544 | $ 522 |  \\n  \\nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution\\'s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $446 billion and $439 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding payment network\\'s rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card partner\\'s members or customers on behalf of the Corporation.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Service Charges  \\n  \\nService charges include deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial  \\n  \\ndeposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money order processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation\\'s Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and treasury management services, including account maintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Investment and Brokerage Services  \\n  \\nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are earned from the management of client assets under advisory agreements or the full discretion of the Corporation\\'s financial advisors (collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of the client\\'s AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps) to 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a client\\'s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.  \\n  \\nBrokerage fees include income earned from transaction-based services that are performed as part of investment management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and sales commissions that are primarily in the  \\n  \\nGlobal Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Investment Banking Income  \\n  \\nInvestment banking income includes underwriting income and financial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees earned for the placement of a customer\\'s debt or equity securities. The revenue is generally earned based on a percentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed. Once the number of shares or notes is determined and the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in performing these services. These expenses are recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan syndication.  \\n  \\nFinancial advisory services consist of fees earned for assisting customers with transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies depending on the size and number of services performed for each contract and is generally contingent on successful execution of the transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the customer.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies  \\n  \\nThe Corporation did not disclose the value of any open performance obligations at December 31, 2018, as its contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is less thanone year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Earnings Per Common Share  \\n  \\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding, excluding unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income allocated to common shareholders is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"99\" -->  \\n'}]}\n",

Assumptions used for the underlying loans that support the MBS can vary widely from loan to loan and are influenced by such factors as loan interest rate, geographic location of the borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. Based on these assumptions, the Corporation then determines how the underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each MBS issued from the applicable special purpose entity. Expected principal and interest cash flows on an impaired AFS debt security are discounted using the effective yield of each individual impaired AFS debt security.  \\n  \\nSignificant assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows for measuring credit losses on non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) were as follows at December 31, 2018.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Significant Assumptions  \\n  \\n| | Weighted average | Range (1) ||  \\n||| 10th Percentile (2) | 90th Percentile (2) |  \\n| - | - | - | - |  \\n| Prepayment speed | 12.9 % | 3.3 % | 21.5% |  \\n| Loss severity | 19.8 | 8.5 | 36.4 |  \\n| Life default rate | 16.9 | 1.4 | 64.4 |  \\n  \\n(1) Represents the range of inputs/assumptions based upon the underlying collateral.  \\n  \\n(2) The value of a variable below which the indicated percentile of observations will fall.  \\n  \\nAnnual constant prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected considering collateral characteristics such as LTV, creditworthiness of borrowers as measured using Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and geographic concentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type was 16.0 percent for prime, 16.6 percent for Alt-A and 25.6 percent for subprime at December 31, 2018. Default rates are projected by considering collateral characteristics including, but not limited to, LTV, FICO and geographic concentration.

Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market's perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer's financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Derivative Assets and Liabilities  \\n  \\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Corporation's own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Loans and Loan Commitments  \\n  \\nThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Mortgage Servicing Rights  \\n  \\nThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread (OAS) valuation approach, which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk- adjusted discount rates.  \\n  \\n151 Bank of America 2018  \\n  \\n  \\n### Loans Held-for-sale  \\n  \\nThe fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation's current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan performance when selecting comparables.  \\n  \\n  \\n#### Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt  \\n  \\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value these liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Securities Financing Agreements  \\n  \\nThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Deposits  \\n  \\nThe fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash market.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Asset-backed Secured Financings  \\n  \\nThe fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation's current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Recurring Fair Value  \\n  \\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis atDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, including financial instruments which the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables.  \\n\"}]\n",

Assumptions used for the underlying loans that support the MBS can vary widely from loan to loan and are influenced by such factors as loan interest rate, geographic location of the borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. Based on these assumptions, the Corporation then determines how the underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each MBS issued from the applicable special purpose entity. Expected principal and interest cash flows on an impaired AFS debt security are discounted using the effective yield of each individual impaired AFS debt security.  \\n  \\nSignificant assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows for measuring credit losses on non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) were as follows at December 31, 2018.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Significant Assumptions  \\n  \\n| | Weighted average | Range (1) ||  \\n||| 10th Percentile (2) | 90th Percentile (2) |  \\n| - | - | - | - |  \\n| Prepayment speed | 12.9 % | 3.3 % | 21.5% |  \\n| Loss severity | 19.8 | 8.5 | 36.4 |  \\n| Life default rate | 16.9 | 1.4 | 64.4 |  \\n  \\n(1) Represents the range of inputs/assumptions based upon the underlying collateral.  \\n  \\n(2) The value of a variable below which the indicated percentile of observations will fall.  \\n  \\nAnnual constant prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected considering collateral characteristics such as LTV, creditworthiness of borrowers as measured using Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and geographic concentrations.

Default rates are projected by considering collateral characteristics including, but not limited to, LTV, FICO and geographic concentration.

Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market's perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer's financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Derivative Assets and Liabilities  \\n  \\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Corporation's own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Loans and Loan Commitments  \\n  \\nThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Mortgage Servicing Rights  \\n  \\nThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread (OAS) valuation approach, which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk- adjusted discount rates.  \\n  \\n151 Bank of America 2018  \\n  \\n  \\n### Loans Held-for-sale  \\n  \\nThe fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation's current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan performance when selecting comparables.  \\n  \\n  \\n#### Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt  \\n  \\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value these liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Securities Financing Agreements  \\n  \\nThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Deposits  \\n  \\nThe fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash market.  \\n  \\n  \\n## Asset-backed Secured Financings  \\n  \\nThe fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation's current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Recurring Fair Value  \\n  \\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis atDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, including financial instruments which the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables.  \\n\"}]}\n",

FICC revenue decreased $723 million in 2018 primarily due to lower activity and a less favorable market in credit-related products. The decline in FICC revenue was also impacted by higher funding costs, which were driven by increases in market interest rates. Equities revenue increased $742 million in 2018 driven by strength in client financing and derivatives.  \\n  \\n  \\n# All Other  \\n  \\n| (Dollars in millions) | 2018 | 2017 | % Change |  \\n| - | - | - | - |  \\n| Net interest income | $ 573 | $ 864 | (34)% |  \\n| Noninterest income (loss) | (1,284) | (1,648) | (22) |  \\n| Total revenue, net of interest expense | (711) | (784) | (9) |  \\n| Provision for credit losses | (476) | (561) | (15) |  \\n| Noninterest expense | 2,614 | 4,065 | (36) |  \\n| Loss before income taxes | (2,849) | (4,288) | (34) |  \\n| Income tax benefit | (2,736) | (979) | n/m |  \\n| Net loss | $ (113) | $ (3,309) | (97) |  \\n| Balance Sheet | | | |  \\n| Average | | | |  \\n| Total loans and leases | $ 61,013 | $ 82,489 | (26)% |  \\n| Total assets (1) | 201,298 | 206,999 | (3) |  \\n| Total deposits | 21,966 | 25,194 | (13) |  \\n| Year end | | | |  \\n| Total loans and leases | 48,061 | $ 69,452 | (31)% |  \\n| Total assets (1) | 196,325 | 194,042 | 1 |  \\n| Total deposits | 18,541 | 22,719 | (18) |  \\n  \\n(1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets fromAll Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders\\' equity.

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.  \\n  \\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.  \\n  \\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.  \\n  \\nDuring 2018, there were three days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Total Trading-related Revenue  \\n  \\nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading- related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.  \\n  \\nThe following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2018 and 2017. During 2018, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 79 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to 2017 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 77 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.  \\n  \\n<figure>  \\n  \\n![](figures/0)  \\n  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Histogram of Daily Trading-related Revenue 160 140 120 Number of Days 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 -25 to 0 0 to 25 25 to 50 50 to 75 75 to 100 greater than 100 Revenue (dollars in millions) DYear Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n</figure>  \\n  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"73 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.016129031777381897, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products. · Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production.', 'highlights': 'Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in<em> equities,</em> partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products. · Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production.'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 1.9106348752975464, 'asset_id': 'd6ed313f-b5a0-d93a-f302-cd12b7418897', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.txt', 'page_number': '85', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'See Note 19 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information. For more information, see page 13 under Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulatory, Compliance and Legal  \\n  \\n  \\n# Goodwill and Intangible Assets  \\n  \\nThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Beginning with our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment, rather than a quantitative assessment as previously performed, that is more fully described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. We performed that test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered in the qualitative assessments include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed.  \\n  \\nBased on our qualitative assessments, we determined that for each reporting unit with goodwill, it was more likely than not that its respective fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating there was no impairment. For more information regarding goodwill balances at June 30, 2018, see Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Representations and Warranties Liability  \\n  \\nThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the type of representations and warranties provided in the sales contracts and considers a variety of factors. These factors, which incorporate judgment, are subject to change based on our specific experience. Our experience in negotiating settlements with trustees and other counterparties is an important input in determining our estimate of the liability. We also consider actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Changes to any one of these factors could impact the estimate of our liability.  \\n  \\nThe representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $200 million in the representations and warranties liability as ofDecember 31, 2018. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.  \\n  \\nFor more information on representations and warranties exposure, seeNote 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"79 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n  \\n## 2017 Compared to 2016  \\n  \\nThe following discussion and analysis provide a comparison of our results of operations for 2017 and 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Overview  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Income  \\n  \\nNet income was $18.2 billion, or $1.56 per diluted share in2017 compared to $17.8 billion, or $1.49 per diluted share in2016. The results for 2017 included a charge of $2.9 billion related to the Tax Act. The pretax results for 2017 compared to 2016 were driven by higher revenue, largely the result of an increase in net interest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Interest Income  \\n  \\nNet interest income increased $3.6 billion to $44.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net interest yield on an FTE basis increased 12 bps to 2.37 percent for 2017. These increases were primarily driven by the benefits from higher interest rates and loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in the second quarter of 2017.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Income  \\n  \\nNoninterest income increased $80 million to $42.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. The following highlights the significant changes.  \\n  \\n· Service charges increased $180 million primarily driven by the impact of pricing strategies and higher treasury services related revenue.  \\n  \\n· Investment and brokerage services income increased $487 million primarily driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing.  \\n  \\nInvestment banking income increased $770 million primarily due to higher advisory fees and higher debt and equity issuance fees.  \\n  \\n. Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products.  \\n  \\n· Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production. Included in 2017 was a $793 million pretax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Provision for Credit Losses  \\n  \\nThe provision for credit losses decreased $201 million to $3.4 billion for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reductions in energy exposures in the commercial portfolio and credit quality improvements in the consumer real estate portfolio. This was partially offset by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio and a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Expense  \\n  \\nNoninterest expense decreased $340 million to $54.7 billion for 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating costs, a reduction from the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and lower litigation expense, partially offset by a $316 million impairment charge related to certain data centers that were in the process of being sold and  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.016129031777381897, '@search.captions': [{'text': \"Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $423 million primarily due to weaker performance in rates products and emerging markets.

Noninterest income decreased $227 million to $10.2 billion driven by lower mortgage banking income, partially offset by higher card income and service charges. The provision for credit losses increased $810 million to $3.5 billion due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $131 million to $17.8 billion driven by higher personnel expense, including the shared success discretionary year-end bonus, and increased FDIC expense, as well as investments in digital capabilities and business growth. These increases were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Wealth & Investment Management  \\n  \\nNet income for GWIM increased $312 million to $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $414 million to $6.2 billion driven by higher short- term interest rates. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $526 million to $12.4 billion. The increase in noninterest income was driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing. Noninterest expense increased $390 million to $13.6 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related incentive costs.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Banking  \\n  \\nNet income for Global Banking increased $1.2 billion to $7.0 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by higher revenue and lower  \\n  \\nprovision for credit losses. Revenue increased $1.6 billion to$20.0 billion driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income increased $1.0 billion to $10.5 billion due to loan and deposit-related growth, higher short-term rates on an increased deposit base and the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, partially offset by credit spread compression. Noninterest income increased $521 million to $9.5 billion largely due to higher investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses decreased $671 million to $212 million in 2017 primarily driven by reductions in energy exposures and continued portfolio improvement, partially offset by Global Banking\\'s portion of a 2017 single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off. Noninterest expense increased $110 million to $8.6 billion in 2017 primarily driven by higher investments in technology and higher deposit insurance, partially offset by lower litigation costs.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Markets  \\n  \\nNet income for Global Markets decreased $524 million to $3.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net DVA losses were $428 million compared to losses of $238 million in 2016. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $405 million to $3.6 billion primarily driven by higher noninterest expense, lower sales and trading revenue and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher investment banking fees. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $423 million primarily due to weaker performance in rates products and emerging markets. The provision for credit losses increased $133 million to $164 million in 2017, reflecting Global Markets\\' portion of a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off. Noninterest expense increased $560 million to $10.7 billion primarily due to higher litigation expense and continued investments in technology.  \\n  \\n  \\n## All Other  \\n  \\nThe net loss for All Other increased $1.6 billion to a net loss of$3.3 billion, driven by a charge of $2.9 billion due to enactment of the Tax Act. The pretax loss for 2017 compared to 2016 decreased $523 million reflecting lower noninterest expense and a larger benefit in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in revenue. Revenue declined $1.5 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income. All other noninterest loss decreased marginally and included a pretax gain of $793 million on the sale of the non-U.S. credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act.  \\n  \\nThe benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $461 million to a benefit of $561 million primarily driven by continued runoff of the non-core portfolio, loan sale recoveries and the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business.  \\n  \\nNoninterest expense decreased $1.5 billion to$4.1 billion driven by lower litigation expense, lower personnel expense and a decline in non-core mortgage servicing costs.  \\n  \\nThe income tax benefit was $1.0 billion in 2017 compared to a benefit of $3.1 billion in 2016.

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.  \\n  \\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.  \\n  \\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.  \\n  \\nDuring 2018, there were three days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Total Trading-related Revenue  \\n  \\nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading- related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.  \\n  \\nThe following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2018 and 2017. During 2018, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 79 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to 2017 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 77 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.  \\n  \\n<figure>  \\n  \\n![](figures/0)  \\n  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Histogram of Daily Trading-related Revenue 160 140 120 Number of Days 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 -25 to 0 0 to 25 25 to 50 50 to 75 75 to 100 greater than 100 Revenue (dollars in millions) DYear Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n</figure>  \\n  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"73 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.016129031777381897, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products. · Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production.', 'highlights': 'Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in<em> equities,</em> partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products. · Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production.'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 1.9106348752975464, 'asset_id': 'd6ed313f-b5a0-d93a-f302-cd12b7418897', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.txt', 'page_number': '85', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_85.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'See Note 19 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information.

Beginning with our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment, rather than a quantitative assessment as previously performed, that is more fully described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. We performed that test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered in the qualitative assessments include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed.  \\n  \\nBased on our qualitative assessments, we determined that for each reporting unit with goodwill, it was more likely than not that its respective fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating there was no impairment. For more information regarding goodwill balances at June 30, 2018, see Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Representations and Warranties Liability  \\n  \\nThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the type of representations and warranties provided in the sales contracts and considers a variety of factors. These factors, which incorporate judgment, are subject to change based on our specific experience. Our experience in negotiating settlements with trustees and other counterparties is an important input in determining our estimate of the liability. We also consider actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Changes to any one of these factors could impact the estimate of our liability.  \\n  \\nThe representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $200 million in the representations and warranties liability as ofDecember 31, 2018. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.  \\n  \\nFor more information on representations and warranties exposure, seeNote 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"79 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n  \\n## 2017 Compared to 2016  \\n  \\nThe following discussion and analysis provide a comparison of our results of operations for 2017 and 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Overview  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Income  \\n  \\nNet income was $18.2 billion, or $1.56 per diluted share in2017 compared to $17.8 billion, or $1.49 per diluted share in2016. The results for 2017 included a charge of $2.9 billion related to the Tax Act. The pretax results for 2017 compared to 2016 were driven by higher revenue, largely the result of an increase in net interest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Interest Income  \\n  \\nNet interest income increased $3.6 billion to $44.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net interest yield on an FTE basis increased 12 bps to 2.37 percent for 2017. These increases were primarily driven by the benefits from higher interest rates and loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in the second quarter of 2017.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Income  \\n  \\nNoninterest income increased $80 million to $42.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. The following highlights the significant changes.  \\n  \\n· Service charges increased $180 million primarily driven by the impact of pricing strategies and higher treasury services related revenue.  \\n  \\n· Investment and brokerage services income increased $487 million primarily driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing.  \\n  \\nInvestment banking income increased $770 million primarily due to higher advisory fees and higher debt and equity issuance fees.  \\n  \\n. Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products.  \\n  \\n· Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production. Included in 2017 was a $793 million pretax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Provision for Credit Losses  \\n  \\nThe provision for credit losses decreased $201 million to $3.4 billion for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reductions in energy exposures in the commercial portfolio and credit quality improvements in the consumer real estate portfolio. This was partially offset by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio and a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Expense  \\n  \\nNoninterest expense decreased $340 million to $54.7 billion for 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating costs, a reduction from the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and lower litigation expense, partially offset by a $316 million impairment charge related to certain data centers that were in the process of being sold and  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.016129031777381897, '@search.captions': [{'text': \"Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $423 million primarily due to weaker performance in rates products and emerging markets.

Noninterest income decreased $227 million to $10.2 billion driven by lower mortgage banking income, partially offset by higher card income and service charges. The provision for credit losses increased $810 million to $3.5 billion due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $131 million to $17.8 billion driven by higher personnel expense, including the shared success discretionary year-end bonus, and increased FDIC expense, as well as investments in digital capabilities and business growth.

Net interest income increased $414 million to $6.2 billion driven by higher short- term interest rates. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $526 million to $12.4 billion. The increase in noninterest income was driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing. Noninterest expense increased $390 million to $13.6 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related incentive costs.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Global Banking  \\n  \\nNet income for Global Banking increased $1.2 billion to $7.0 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by higher revenue and lower  \\n  \\nprovision for credit losses. Revenue increased $1.6 billion to$20.0 billion driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income increased $1.0 billion to $10.5 billion due to loan and deposit-related growth, higher short-term rates on an increased deposit base and the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, partially offset by credit spread compression. Noninterest income increased $521 million to $9.5 billion largely due to higher investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses decreased $671 million to $212 million in 2017 primarily driven by reductions in energy exposures and continued portfolio improvement, partially offset by Global Banking\\'s portion of a 2017 single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off.

Noninterest expense increased $560 million to $10.7 billion primarily due to higher litigation expense and continued investments in technology.  \\n  \\n  \\n## All Other  \\n  \\nThe net loss for All Other increased $1.6 billion to a net loss of$3.3 billion, driven by a charge of $2.9 billion due to enactment of the Tax Act. The pretax loss for 2017 compared to 2016 decreased $523 million reflecting lower noninterest expense and a larger benefit in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in revenue. Revenue declined $1.5 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income. All other noninterest loss decreased marginally and included a pretax gain of $793 million on the sale of the non-U.S. credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act.  \\n  \\nThe benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $461 million to a benefit of $561 million primarily driven by continued runoff of the non-core portfolio, loan sale recoveries and the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business.  \\n  \\nNoninterest expense decreased $1.5 billion to$4.1 billion driven by lower litigation expense, lower personnel expense and a decline in non-core mortgage servicing costs.  \\n  \\nThe income tax benefit was $1.0 billion in 2017 compared to a benefit of $3.1 billion in 2016. The decrease in the tax benefit was driven by the impacts of the Tax Act. Both periods include income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Bank of America 2018 80\" -->  \\n'}]}\n",

For each variable, try to locate the relevant dataframes from the above code and the relevant variable assignment statements. Then try to locate the relevant columns or rows in the relevant dataframes. Finally, try to locate the relevant values in the dataframe or in the variable assignment statements. \\n\\nHere is the Chain of Thought and the step-by-step that you should follow:\\n\\n    1. You **MUST** import the list of Python files specified by the user above in the \"List of Python Files\" section.\\n    2. Use the Codeblocks delimited by \\'## START OF CODEBLOCK\\' and \\'## END OF CODEBLOCK\\' to identify and print to the output the variables of interest. Include the variable assignment statements in the output. Limit this list to the relevant variables **ONLY**. Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.\\n    3. Use the Codeblocks delimited by \\'## START OF CODEBLOCK\\' and \\'## END OF CODEBLOCK\\' to identify and print to the output the relevant dataframes names, and print to the output all their columns. Also print all the variable assignment statements. Include the dataframes assignment statements in the output. Limit this list to the relevant dataframes **ONLY**. Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.\\n    4. In the case of dataframes, in which columns did the variables of interest in the question appear in the dataframe? use the str.contains method on **ALL** the columns in the dataframe to determine the columns. You **MUST** test **ALL THE COLUMNS**. (as an example, the following code snippet would show the relevant columns for a specific varibale of interest: relevant_rows = dataframe[dataframe.apply(lambda row: row.astype(str).str.contains(<VARIABLE OF INTEREST>).any(), axis=1)] - you can modify the code to suit the the question being asked). Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.\\n    5. If you want to generate RegEx expressions, make sure that the RegEx expression is valid. Do **NOT** generate something like this: str.replace(\\'[extbackslash\\textdollar,]\\', \\'\\', regex=True), which is obviously invalid, since the $ sign is spelled as \\'extdollar\\', and the \\'\\\\\\' is spelled as \\'extbackslash\\'.\\n    6. If you have trouble accessing the previously defined variables or the dataframes for any reasons, then use the Python Codeblocks delimited by \\'## START OF CODEBLOCK\\' and \\'## END OF CODEBLOCK\\' to extract the information you need, and then generate the needed Python code.\\n    7. Generate the answer to the query. You **MUST** clarify AND print to the output **ALL** calculation steps leading up to the final answer.\\n    8. You **MUST** detail how you came up with the answer. Please provide a complete description of the calculation steps taken to get to the answer. Please reference the PDF Document and the page number you got the answer from, e.g. \"This answer was derived from document \\'Sales_Presentation.pdf\\', page 34\".\\n    9. If the answer contains numerical data, then you **MUST** create an Excel file with an extension .xlsx with the data, you **MUST** include inside the Excel the steps of the calculations, the justification, and **ALL** the reference and source numbers and tables that you used to come up with a final answer in addition to the final answer (this Excel is meant for human consumption, do **NOT** use programming variable names as column or row headers, instead use names that are fully meaningful to humans), you **MUST** be elaborate in your comments and rows and column names inside the Excel, you **MUST** save it to the working directory, and then you **MUST** print the full path of the Excel sheet with the final answer - use os.path.abs() to print the full path.\\n    10. **VERY IMPORTANT**: do **NOT** attempt to create a list of variables or dataframes directly. Instead, you should access the data from the variables and dataframes that were defined in the Python file that was run.\\n    \\n\\nQuestion: How much more was generated from sales and trading revenue for equities in 2018 compared to 2017?\\n\\nIn your final answer, be elaborate in your response. Describe your logic and the calculation steps to the user, and describe how you deduced the answer step by step. If there are any assumptions you made, please state them clearly. Describe in details the computation steps you took, quote values and quantities, describe equations as if you are explaining a solution of a math problem to a 12-year old student. Please relay all steps to the user, and clarify how you got to the final answer. Please reference the PDF Document and the page number you got the answer from, e.g. \"This answer was derived from document \\'Sales_Presentation.pdf\\', page 34\". After generating the final response, and if the final answer contains numerical data, then you **MUST** create an Excel file with an extension .xlsx with the data, you **MUST** include inside the Excel the steps of the calculations, the justification, and **ALL** the reference and source numbers and tables that you used to come up with a final answer in addition to the final answer (this Excel is meant for human consumption, do **NOT** use programming variable names as column or row headers, instead use names that are fully meaningful to humans), you **MUST** be elaborate in your comments and rows and column names inside the Excel, you **MUST** save it to the working directory, and then you **MUST** print the full path of the Excel sheet with the final answer - use os.path.abs() to print the full path.\\n\\n'}, 'type': 'text'}]\n",

For each variable, try to locate the relevant dataframes from the above code and the relevant variable assignment statements. Then try to locate the relevant columns or rows in the relevant dataframes. Finally, try to locate the relevant values in the dataframe or in the variable assignment statements. \\n\\nHere is the Chain of Thought and the step-by-step that you should follow:\\n\\n    1. You **MUST** import the list of Python files specified by the user above in the \"List of Python Files\" section.\\n    2. Use the Codeblocks delimited by \\'## START OF CODEBLOCK\\' and \\'## END OF CODEBLOCK\\' to identify and print to the output the variables of interest. Include the variable assignment statements in the output. Limit this list to the relevant variables **ONLY**. Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.\\n    3. Use the Codeblocks delimited by \\'## START OF CODEBLOCK\\' and \\'## END OF CODEBLOCK\\' to identify and print to the output the relevant dataframes names, and print to the output all their columns. Also print all the variable assignment statements. Include the dataframes assignment statements in the output. Limit this list to the relevant dataframes **ONLY**. Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.\\n    4. In the case of dataframes, in which columns did the variables of interest in the question appear in the dataframe? use the str.contains method on **ALL** the columns in the dataframe to determine the columns. You **MUST** test **ALL THE COLUMNS**. (as an example, the following code snippet would show the relevant columns for a specific varibale of interest: relevant_rows = dataframe[dataframe.apply(lambda row: row.astype(str).str.contains(<VARIABLE OF INTEREST>).any(), axis=1)] - you can modify the code to suit the the question being asked). Generate the Python code that will do this step and execute it.\\n    5. If you want to generate RegEx expressions, make sure that the RegEx expression is valid. Do **NOT** generate something like this: str.replace(\\'[extbackslash\\textdollar,]\\', \\'\\', regex=True), which is obviously invalid, since the $ sign is spelled as \\'extdollar\\', and the \\'\\\\\\' is spelled as \\'extbackslash\\'.\\n    6. If you have trouble accessing the previously defined variables or the dataframes for any reasons, then use the Python Codeblocks delimited by \\'## START OF CODEBLOCK\\' and \\'## END OF CODEBLOCK\\' to extract the information you need, and then generate the needed Python code.\\n    7. Generate the answer to the query. You **MUST** clarify AND print to the output **ALL** calculation steps leading up to the final answer.\\n    8. You **MUST** detail how you came up with the answer. Please provide a complete description of the calculation steps taken to get to the answer. Please reference the PDF Document and the page number you got the answer from, e.g. \"This answer was derived from document \\'Sales_Presentation.pdf\\', page 34\".\\n    9. If the answer contains numerical data, then you **MUST** create an Excel file with an extension .xlsx with the data, you **MUST** include inside the Excel the steps of the calculations, the justification, and **ALL** the reference and source numbers and tables that you used to come up with a final answer in addition to the final answer (this Excel is meant for human consumption, do **NOT** use programming variable names as column or row headers, instead use names that are fully meaningful to humans), you **MUST** be elaborate in your comments and rows and column names inside the Excel, you **MUST** save it to the working directory, and then you **MUST** print the full path of the Excel sheet with the final answer - use os.path.abs() to print the full path.\\n    10. **VERY IMPORTANT**: do **NOT** attempt to create a list of variables or dataframes directly. Instead, you should access the data from the variables and dataframes that were defined in the Python file that was run.\\n    \\n\\nQuestion: How much more was generated from sales and trading revenue for equities in 2018 compared to 2017?\\n\\nIn your final answer, be elaborate in your response. Describe your logic and the calculation steps to the user, and describe how you deduced the answer step by step. If there are any assumptions you made, please state them clearly. Describe in details the computation steps you took, quote values and quantities, describe equations as if you are explaining a solution of a math problem to a 12-year old student. Please relay all steps to the user, and clarify how you got to the final answer. Please reference the PDF Document and the page number you got the answer from, e.g. \"This answer was derived from document \\'Sales_Presentation.pdf\\', page 34\". After generating the final response, and if the final answer contains numerical data, then you **MUST** create an Excel file with an extension .xlsx with the data, you **MUST** include inside the Excel the steps of the calculations, the justification, and **ALL** the reference and source numbers and tables that you used to come up with a final answer in addition to the final answer (this Excel is meant for human consumption, do **NOT** use programming variable names as column or row headers, instead use names that are fully meaningful to humans), you **MUST** be elaborate in your comments and rows and column names inside the Excel, you **MUST** save it to the working directory, and then you **MUST** print the full path of the Excel sheet with the final answer - use os.path.abs() to print the full path.\\n\\n'}, 'type': 'text'}]\n",

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.  \\n  \\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.  \\n  \\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.  \\n  \\nDuring 2018, there were three days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Total Trading-related Revenue  \\n  \\nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading- related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.  \\n  \\nThe following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2018 and 2017. During 2018, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 79 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to 2017 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 77 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.  \\n  \\n<figure>  \\n  \\n![](figures/0)  \\n  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Histogram of Daily Trading-related Revenue 160 140 120 Number of Days 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 -25 to 0 0 to 25 25 to 50 50 to 75 75 to 100 greater than 100 Revenue (dollars in millions) DYear Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n</figure>  \\n  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"73 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.010869565419852734, '@search.captions': [{'text': '# Net Interest Income      Net interest income increased $2.8 billion to $47.4 billion in 2018 compared to 2017.

Business Banking clients include mid-sized U.S .- based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions.  \\n  \\nNet income for Global Banking increased $1.2 billion to $8.2 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by lower income tax expense from the reduction in the federal income tax rate and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower revenue. Noninterest expense was relatively unchanged.  \\n  \\nRevenue decreased $355 million to $19.6 billion driven by lower noninterest income, partially offset by higher net interest income. Net interest income increased $377 million to $10.9 billion primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates, as well as loan and deposit growth. Noninterest income decreased $732 million to $8.8 billion primarily due to lower investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses improved $204 million to $8 million primarily driven by Global Banking\\'s portion of a 2017 single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off and continued improvement in the commercial portfolio.  \\n  \\nThe return on average allocated capital was20 percent, up from 17 percent, as higher net income was partially offset by an increased capital allocation.

Beginning with our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment, rather than a quantitative assessment as previously performed, that is more fully described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. We performed that test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered in the qualitative assessments include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed.  \\n  \\nBased on our qualitative assessments, we determined that for each reporting unit with goodwill, it was more likely than not that its respective fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating there was no impairment. For more information regarding goodwill balances at June 30, 2018, see Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Representations and Warranties Liability  \\n  \\nThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the type of representations and warranties provided in the sales contracts and considers a variety of factors. These factors, which incorporate judgment, are subject to change based on our specific experience. Our experience in negotiating settlements with trustees and other counterparties is an important input in determining our estimate of the liability. We also consider actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Changes to any one of these factors could impact the estimate of our liability.  \\n  \\nThe representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $200 million in the representations and warranties liability as ofDecember 31, 2018. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.  \\n  \\nFor more information on representations and warranties exposure, seeNote 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"79 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n  \\n## 2017 Compared to 2016  \\n  \\nThe following discussion and analysis provide a comparison of our results of operations for 2017 and 2016.

The results for 2017 included a charge of $2.9 billion related to the Tax Act. The pretax results for 2017 compared to 2016 were driven by higher revenue, largely the result of an increase in net interest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Interest Income  \\n  \\nNet interest income increased $3.6 billion to $44.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net interest yield on an FTE basis increased 12 bps to 2.37 percent for 2017. These increases were primarily driven by the benefits from higher interest rates and loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in the second quarter of 2017.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Income  \\n  \\nNoninterest income increased $80 million to $42.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. The following highlights the significant changes.  \\n  \\n· Service charges increased $180 million primarily driven by the impact of pricing strategies and higher treasury services related revenue.  \\n  \\n· Investment and brokerage services income increased $487 million primarily driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing.  \\n  \\nInvestment banking income increased $770 million primarily due to higher advisory fees and higher debt and equity issuance fees.  \\n  \\n. Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products.  \\n  \\n· Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production. Included in 2017 was a $793 million pretax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Provision for Credit Losses  \\n  \\nThe provision for credit losses decreased $201 million to $3.4 billion for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reductions in energy exposures in the commercial portfolio and credit quality improvements in the consumer real estate portfolio. This was partially offset by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio and a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Expense  \\n  \\nNoninterest expense decreased $340 million to $54.7 billion for 2017 compared to 2016.

We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes loans held-for-sale (LHFS) and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component.  \\n  \\nThe first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan\\'s original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan\\'s observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card, small business credit card and unsecured consumer TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans.  \\n  \\nThe second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer (including credit card and other consumer loans) and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, which include both quantitative and qualitative components, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates  \\n  \\nthe portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2018, the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance related to the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios compared to December 31, 2017.  \\n  \\nThe allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data, including external default data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the loss given default (LGD) based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor\\'s liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor\\'s credit risk. As of December 31, 2018, the allowance for the U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios decreased compared to December 31, 2017.  \\n  \\nAlso included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data.  \\n  \\nDuring 2018, the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvement in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets are low levels of unemployment and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $1.3 billion in 2018 as returns to performing status, loan sales, paydowns and charge-offs continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. During 2018, the allowance for loan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflected decreased energy reserves primarily driven by improvement in energy exposures including reservable criticized utilized exposures.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"67 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.009900989942252636, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements.', 'highlights': 'We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value<em> measurements.</em>'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 2.2653567790985107, 'asset_id': 'de32839b-cb85-1c5d-4a3f-95b08111630d', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_8.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_8.txt', 'page_number': '8', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_8.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_8.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_8.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'the volume of client activity in our trading operations, (vii) investment banking fees, (viii) the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and (ix) our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing. For example, the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. If the Federal Reserve or a non-U.S. central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy, market interest rates could be affected, which could adversely impact the value of such assets. In addition, the low but rising interest rate environment and recent flattening of the yield curve could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, including future revenue and earnings growth.  \\n  \\nWe use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent limitations. For more information regarding models and strategies, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Other on page 16. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa. These types of market movements may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets. To the extent that we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions. In addition, challenging market conditions may also adversely affect our investment banking fees.  \\n  \\nFor more information about market risk and our market risk management policies and procedures, see Market Risk Management in the MD&A on page 70.  \\n  \\nWe may incur losses if the value of certain assets declines, including due to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds.  \\n  \\nWe have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including certain loans and loan commitments, loans held-for-sale, securities financing agreements, asset- backed secured financings, long-term deposits, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale (AFS) debt and marketable equity securities, other debt securities, equity method investments, certain MSRs and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments. We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. The fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality, funding impact on certain derivatives and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate.  \\n  \\nGains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations, including higher or lower mortgage banking income and earnings, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. For example, decreases in interest rates and increases in mortgage prepayment speeds, which are influenced by interest rates and other factors such as reductions in mortgage insurance premiums and origination costs, could adversely impact the value of our MSR asset, and cause a significant acceleration of purchase premium amortization on our mortgage portfolio, because a decline in long-term interest rates shortens the expected lives of the securities, and adversely affects our net  \\n  \\ninterest margin. Conversely, increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations. In addition, increases in interest rates may adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and, thus, capital levels.  \\n  \\nFair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions. The financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets, which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs. Asset values also directly impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses. We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients\\' portfolios or investments in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive performance fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values can reduce the value of our clients\\' portfolios or fund assets, which in turn can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets.  \\n  \\nFor more information on fair value measurements, seeNote 20 - Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on our asset management businesses, see GWIM in the MD&A on page 33. For more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A on page 74.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Liquidity  \\n  \\nIf we are unable to access the capital markets, continue to maintain deposits, or our borrowing costs increase, our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected.  \\n  \\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. We fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets. We rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive in nature. We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets; illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets; the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements due to credit concerns for short-term borrowing; changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile; prolonged federal government shutdowns; changes in regulations, guidance or GSE status that impact our funding avenues or ability to access certain funding sources; the refusal or inability of the Federal Reserve to act as lender of last resort; simultaneous draws on lines of credit; the withdrawal of customer deposits, which could result from customer attrition for higher yields or the desire for more conservative alternatives; increased regulatory liquidity, capital and margin requirements for our U.S. or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries; failure by a significant market participant or third party, such as a clearing agent or custodian; reputational issues; or negative perceptions about our short- or long-term business prospects, including downgrades of our credit ratings.

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.  \\n  \\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.  \\n  \\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.  \\n  \\nDuring 2018, there were three days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Total Trading-related Revenue  \\n  \\nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading- related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.  \\n  \\nThe following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2018 and 2017. During 2018, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 79 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to 2017 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 77 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.  \\n  \\n<figure>  \\n  \\n![](figures/0)  \\n  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Histogram of Daily Trading-related Revenue 160 140 120 Number of Days 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 -25 to 0 0 to 25 25 to 50 50 to 75 75 to 100 greater than 100 Revenue (dollars in millions) DYear Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n</figure>  \\n  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"73 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.010869565419852734, '@search.captions': [{'text': '# Net Interest Income      Net interest income increased $2.8 billion to $47.4 billion in 2018 compared to 2017.

For more information, see page 13 under Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulatory, Compliance and Legal  \\n  \\n  \\n# Goodwill and Intangible Assets  \\n  \\nThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Beginning with our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment, rather than a quantitative assessment as previously performed, that is more fully described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as ofJune 30, 2018 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. We performed that test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered in the qualitative assessments include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed.  \\n  \\nBased on our qualitative assessments, we determined that for each reporting unit with goodwill, it was more likely than not that its respective fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating there was no impairment. For more information regarding goodwill balances at June 30, 2018, see Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Representations and Warranties Liability  \\n  \\nThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the type of representations and warranties provided in the sales contracts and considers a variety of factors. These factors, which incorporate judgment, are subject to change based on our specific experience. Our experience in negotiating settlements with trustees and other counterparties is an important input in determining our estimate of the liability. We also consider actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Changes to any one of these factors could impact the estimate of our liability.  \\n  \\nThe representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $200 million in the representations and warranties liability as ofDecember 31, 2018. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.  \\n  \\nFor more information on representations and warranties exposure, seeNote 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"79 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n  \\n  \\n## 2017 Compared to 2016  \\n  \\nThe following discussion and analysis provide a comparison of our results of operations for 2017 and 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Overview  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Income  \\n  \\nNet income was $18.2 billion, or $1.56 per diluted share in2017 compared to $17.8 billion, or $1.49 per diluted share in2016. The results for 2017 included a charge of $2.9 billion related to the Tax Act. The pretax results for 2017 compared to 2016 were driven by higher revenue, largely the result of an increase in net interest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Net Interest Income  \\n  \\nNet interest income increased $3.6 billion to $44.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net interest yield on an FTE basis increased 12 bps to 2.37 percent for 2017. These increases were primarily driven by the benefits from higher interest rates and loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in the second quarter of 2017.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Income  \\n  \\nNoninterest income increased $80 million to $42.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. The following highlights the significant changes.  \\n  \\n· Service charges increased $180 million primarily driven by the impact of pricing strategies and higher treasury services related revenue.  \\n  \\n· Investment and brokerage services income increased $487 million primarily driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing.  \\n  \\nInvestment banking income increased $770 million primarily due to higher advisory fees and higher debt and equity issuance fees.  \\n  \\n. Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products.  \\n  \\n· Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production. Included in 2017 was a $793 million pretax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Provision for Credit Losses  \\n  \\nThe provision for credit losses decreased $201 million to $3.4 billion for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reductions in energy exposures in the commercial portfolio and credit quality improvements in the consumer real estate portfolio. This was partially offset by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio and a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Noninterest Expense  \\n  \\nNoninterest expense decreased $340 million to $54.7 billion for 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating costs, a reduction from the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and lower litigation expense, partially offset by a $316 million impairment charge related to certain data centers that were in the process of being sold and  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.012048192322254181, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'The provision for credit losses was $481 million lower than net charge-offs for 2018, resulting ina reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

The provision for credit losses was $481 million lower than net charge-offs for 2018, resulting ina reduction in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $583 million in the allowance for credit losses in 2017.  \\n  \\nThe provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio increased $222 million to $2.9 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a slower pace of improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio, and portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio, partially offset by the impact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in 2017.  \\n  \\nThe provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $336 million to $333 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by a 2017 single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off and improvement in the commercial portfolio.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Allowance for Credit Losses  \\n  \\n  \\n# Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses  \\n  \\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes loans held-for-sale (LHFS) and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component.  \\n  \\nThe first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan\\'s original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan\\'s observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card, small business credit card and unsecured consumer TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans.  \\n  \\nThe second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer (including credit card and other consumer loans) and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, which include both quantitative and qualitative components, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates  \\n  \\nthe portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2018, the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance related to the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios compared to December 31, 2017.  \\n  \\nThe allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data, including external default data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the loss given default (LGD) based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor\\'s liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor\\'s credit risk. As of December 31, 2018, the allowance for the U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios decreased compared to December 31, 2017.  \\n  \\nAlso included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data.  \\n  \\nDuring 2018, the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvement in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets are low levels of unemployment and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $1.3 billion in 2018 as returns to performing status, loan sales, paydowns and charge-offs continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. During 2018, the allowance for loan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflected decreased energy reserves primarily driven by improvement in energy exposures including reservable criticized utilized exposures.  \\n  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"67 Bank of America 2018\" -->  \\n'}, {'@search.score': 0.009900989942252636, '@search.captions': [{'text': 'We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements.', 'highlights': 'We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value<em> measurements.</em>'}], '@search.rerankerScore': 2.2653567790985107, 'asset_id': 'de32839b-cb85-1c5d-4a3f-95b08111630d', 'asset_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_8.txt', 'pdf_path': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\BofA 2018.pdf', 'filename': 'BofA 2018.pdf', 'image_file': '', 'asset_filename': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_8.txt', 'page_number': '8', 'type': 'text', 'document_id': '1f9d0fb0-9106-6f55-9c57-d77ae4f60afc', 'python_block': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_8.codeblock', 'python_code': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_8.py', 'markdown': './Data/BOFA\\\\ingestion\\\\BofA_2018\\\\text\\\\page_8.md', 'mermaid': '', 'tags': '', 'text': 'the volume of client activity in our trading operations, (vii) investment banking fees, (viii) the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and (ix) our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing. For example, the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. If the Federal Reserve or a non-U.S. central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy, market interest rates could be affected, which could adversely impact the value of such assets. In addition, the low but rising interest rate environment and recent flattening of the yield curve could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, including future revenue and earnings growth.  \\n  \\nWe use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent limitations. For more information regarding models and strategies, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Other on page 16. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa. These types of market movements may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets. To the extent that we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions. In addition, challenging market conditions may also adversely affect our investment banking fees.  \\n  \\nFor more information about market risk and our market risk management policies and procedures, see Market Risk Management in the MD&A on page 70.  \\n  \\nWe may incur losses if the value of certain assets declines, including due to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds.  \\n  \\nWe have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including certain loans and loan commitments, loans held-for-sale, securities financing agreements, asset- backed secured financings, long-term deposits, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale (AFS) debt and marketable equity securities, other debt securities, equity method investments, certain MSRs and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments. We determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. The fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality, funding impact on certain derivatives and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate.  \\n  \\nGains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations, including higher or lower mortgage banking income and earnings, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. For example, decreases in interest rates and increases in mortgage prepayment speeds, which are influenced by interest rates and other factors such as reductions in mortgage insurance premiums and origination costs, could adversely impact the value of our MSR asset, and cause a significant acceleration of purchase premium amortization on our mortgage portfolio, because a decline in long-term interest rates shortens the expected lives of the securities, and adversely affects our net  \\n  \\ninterest margin. Conversely, increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations. In addition, increases in interest rates may adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and, thus, capital levels.  \\n  \\nFair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions. The financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets, which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs. Asset values also directly impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses. We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients\\' portfolios or investments in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive performance fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values can reduce the value of our clients\\' portfolios or fund assets, which in turn can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets.  \\n  \\nFor more information on fair value measurements, seeNote 20 - Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on our asset management businesses, see GWIM in the MD&A on page 33. For more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&A on page 74.  \\n  \\n  \\n# Liquidity  \\n  \\nIf we are unable to access the capital markets, continue to maintain deposits, or our borrowing costs increase, our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected.  \\n  \\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. We fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets. We rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive in nature. We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer lending activities. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets; illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets; the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements due to credit concerns for short-term borrowing; changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile; prolonged federal government shutdowns; changes in regulations, guidance or GSE status that impact our funding avenues or ability to access certain funding sources; the refusal or inability of the Federal Reserve to act as lender of last resort; simultaneous draws on lines of credit; the withdrawal of customer deposits, which could result from customer attrition for higher yields or the desire for more conservative alternatives; increased regulatory liquidity, capital and margin requirements for our U.S. or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries; failure by a significant market participant or third party, such as a clearing agent or custodian; reputational issues; or negative perceptions about our short- or long-term business prospects, including downgrades of our credit ratings.
